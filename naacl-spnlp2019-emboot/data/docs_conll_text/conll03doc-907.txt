BONN 1996-08-29
About 200 German anti-nuclear activists protested on Thursday against nuclear waste transportation by re-enacting scenes from a demonstration they staged in May that turned into a violent clash with police .
Activists dressed as police brandished batons and firing a theatre-prop water cannon at " demonstrators " .
Police who had turned out in force all around the government quarter fearing violence looked on in amusement .
Last May dozens of demonstrators and police were injured in violent clashes around the Gorleben nuclear waste depot as hundreds of protesters tried to block a delivery of waste by train and truck .

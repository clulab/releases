BASEBALL - BRAVES SIGN NEAGLE .
ATLANTA 1996-08-28
The defending world champion Atlanta Braves , with the best record and best pitching in baseball , added another weapon Wednesday , acquiring Denny Neagle , the winningest left-hander in the National League , from the Pittsburgh Pirates .
The Pirates , who conceded earlier this week they would be forced to trim salary from next season 's payroll , received Ron Wright , a first baseman at Double-A Greenville ; Corey Pointer , a pitcher at Class-A Eugene , and a player to be named .
It was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the Braves , who already have an 11-game lead in the National League Eastern Division .
In the last 15 days , Atlanta has traded for third baseman Terry Pendleton , claimed outfielder Luis Polonia on waivers and called up minor-league phenom Andruw Jones , all in preparation for their fifth post-season .

Shareholders of the Polish construction firm Mostostal Zabrze Holding SA approved a 25- million-zloty , five-year convertible issue with a par value of 100 zlotys each , the company 's spokesman said on Monday .
Piotr Grabowski told Reuters that a Mostostal extraordinary shareholders meeting on Saturday had decided that the price of the 250,000 bonds would be set as a 10-session average price of Mostostal shares plus a premium .
" The premium will be no lower than 15 percent and will be set by management before the issue ...
which we expect at the beginning of next year , " Grabowksi said .
Mostostal , based in southern Poland , wants to offer the bonds to large investors in a public offering , paying an annual coupon of no more than 80 percent of the yield of the benchmark 52-week T-bill .
The firm has signed an agreement with the Polish Development Bank ( PBR ) to manage the issue and plans them to be listed on the Warsaw bourse 's bond market .

The price will be determined through book-building .

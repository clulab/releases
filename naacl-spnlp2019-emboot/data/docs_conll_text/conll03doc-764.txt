NUREMBERG , Germany 1996-08-28
German riot police made Nazi gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions , the Bavarian Interior Ministry said on Wednesday .
The ministry declined to detail gestures the Nuremberg-based policemen had made at the August 13 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry .
A spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city , where dictator Adolf Hitler held some of his most infamous Nazi party rallies in the 1930s , said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public .

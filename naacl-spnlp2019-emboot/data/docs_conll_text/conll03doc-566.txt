Argentine bishop reminds cabinet of Commandments .
BUENOS AIRES , Argentina 1996-08-27
The Archbishop of Buenos Aires said on Tuesday the first thing he would do if elected president of Argentina would be to put up posters of the Ten Commandments in government offices .
" They asked me what would be the first thing I would do if I were president , and I said the first thing I would do would be to resign straight away , " Archbishop Antonio Quarracino said at a sermon attended by several cabinet ministers .
" But before going , I would have big signs put up in all government offices , those to do with justice , in all sectors , with the Ten Commandments , " he added .
Argentina 's top Roman Catholic cleric said the Biblical commandment " Thou shalt not steal " would get special emphasis " because it has to be about the most common thing these days . "
Quarracino and other Church leaders are regular critics of the government 's free-market economic policy .

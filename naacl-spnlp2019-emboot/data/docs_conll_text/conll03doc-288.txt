Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro was due to fly to the United States on Saturday for a medical check-up to determine if surgery was needed on the lower part of her spinal column , the government said on Friday .
Chamorro has complained of lower back pain since her trip to Taiwan in May , when the pain forced her to go to Taipei University Hospital for an examination .
Chamorro , 66 , suffers from osteoporosis , a disease that weakens the bones , and has repeatedly flown to Washington for treatment by her longtime doctor , Sam Wilson .

NEW DELHI 1996-08-25
Indian opener Navjot Singh Sidhu was on Sunday given a 50-day ban from international cricket for quitting this year 's tour of England , the Press Trust of India said .
The right-handed batsman will have to forfeit half the money he was due to earn from the tour , the news agency said after a disciplinary committee set up by the Board of Control for Cricket in India met at Mohali , near the northern city of Chandigarh .
Sidhu abandoned the Indian team after the third one-day international against England at Old Trafford in Manchester on May 26 , before India began a three-test series , citing serious differences with captain Mohammed Azharuddin .
Azharuddin was sacked after the tour and replaced by Sachin Tendulkar .
Sidhu was not considered for the four-nation Singer Cup beginning in Sri Lanka this month and the Sahara Cup against Pakistan scheduled to be played in Canada next month .
Sidhu , whose ban ends on October 14 , will be free to play domestic cricket .
He will not be considered for a test match against Australia starting on October 10 in New Delhi , the United News of India said .

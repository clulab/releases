INGOLSTADT 1996-08-29
Audi AG management board chairman Herbert Demel said on Thursday that the German luxury carmaker , a unit of Volkswagen AG , did not expect any burden on its 1996 results from currency market volatility .
" We do not expect any burden on our 1996 results from currency markets , " Demel told Reuters in an interview .
Audi would have been able to report a profit 300 million marks higher in 1995 if exchange rates had stayed the same as in 1994 , Demel had told a shareholder meeting last April .
Demel said the carmaker had hedged about half of its currency risk for 1996 .

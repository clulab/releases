Thai PM proposes Sept 18 for no-confidence debate .
BANGKOK 1996-08-26
Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa on Monday proposed September 18 as the date for parliamentary debate on an opposition no-confidence motion accusing him of incompetence .
The president of parliament had earlier said September 11 could be set for the debate .
The opposition motion against Banharn accuses him of being incompetent , lacking ethical leadership and alleges his administration is corrupt .
His critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate .
Banharn has denied the accusations and said he is ready to clear himself in parliament .
" In my opinion September 18 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions .
This has nothing to do with the accusation that I am trying to escape the debate , " Banharn told reporters after meeting coalition partners .
Banharn 's 13-month-old , six-party coalition government controls 209 seats in the 391-seat lower house of parliament .
Political infighting within Banharn 's Chart Thai party has raised doubts whether he can hold his supporters together and defeat the opposition motion , political analysts said .
" We are still waiting to fix a date .
September 18 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda , " said an official at parliament 's agenda section .
The last no-confidence debate against Banharn 's coalition in May was won by the government .

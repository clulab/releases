NEW YORK 1996-08-28
Chile 's state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo ( ENAP ) bought a second spot cargo of Oriente and nearly one million barrels of Escravos in a recent tender , traders said Wednesday .
A 400,000 barrel cargo of Ecuadorian Oriente and 960,000 barrels of Nigerian Escravos was awarded in a tender for Oct 15-18 late last week , but price information remains vague .
" The Oriente will be supplied by the same seller at a small premium to formula , " a trade source said , referring to the first October cargo sold two weeks ago at Petroecuador 's sale formula plus five cents fob .
Escravos was sold on a Dated Brent related basis , with premiums for the light grade seen in the low 50-cent range .
The next purchase tender from ENAP is expected for late October or early November crude , traders said .

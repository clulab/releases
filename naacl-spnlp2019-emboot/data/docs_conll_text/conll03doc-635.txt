Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market .
WINNIPEG 1996-08-28
Canada 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production .
" Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement .
SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 .
The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie .
Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie .
SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework .
Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .

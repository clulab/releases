Netanyahu , Weizman consult on Arafat invitation .
JERUSALEM 1996-08-25
Israeli President Ezer Weizman , weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat , consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a spokesman said .
Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said .
Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process .
But the official , Aryeh Shumer , said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces .
The newspaper said Netanyahu , who is cool to meeting Arafat himself , opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president .
After Moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March , Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended .
Shumer said his current position was that the peace process must continue .

Western Province batsman Herschelle Gibbs was the only uncapped player in South Africa 's 14-man squad named on Wednesday for a quadrangular one-day series in Kenya next month .
Kenya , South Africa , Pakistan and Sri Lanka will take part in the series .
National coach Bob Woolmer said Gibbs , 22 , had been rewarded for a tremendous tour of England with the South African A team earlier this year .
" I 've known Herschelle since he was 11 years old and he showed in England how he has matured .
His 170 against the MCC was an innings of supreme class against the best bowling attack we faced all tour , " Woolmer told a news conference .

" We were not able to consider Jacques Kallis , Paul Adams and Shaun Pollock due to injury and the replacements have all come from the A tour and it 's great that they are all in form . "
Spin-bowling all-rounders Nicky Boje and Derek Crookes replace Pollock and Adams , while Gibbs comes in for his Western Province colleague Kallis .

SOCCER - CHAMPIONS PORTO KICK OFF SEASON WITH A DRAW .
LISBON 1996-08-25
Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time .
Porto , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute .
Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time .
Setubal , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game , opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto 's new Polish keeper Andrejez Wozniak .
Conde scored his second in the 70th minute .
Benfica , also playing their first game of the season at home , were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence .
Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury .
He was substituted by Paulao .
Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee 's nose .
Braga defender Idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net .

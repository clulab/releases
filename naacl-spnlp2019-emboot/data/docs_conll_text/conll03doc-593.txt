Paralympics an example for gloomy France-Juppe .
PARIS 1996-08-27
Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Tuesday hailed handicapped athletes who took part in Atlanta 's Paralympic Games as an example for gloom-stricken France .
" What we hear every morning is gloom , resignation and scepticism ...
You are the opposite , " Juppe told a successful French team at Paris airport as he welcomed them back from the games which followed the July-August Olympics .
" If you had been struck ...
by the disease of scepticism , gloom and resignation , you would not be here .
You are a true example for the nation , " he said .
The French team won 95 medals in Atlanta , 35 of them gold .
Opinion polls consistently show French voters pessimistic and fed up as the economy stagnates and unemployement lingers at near-record levels .

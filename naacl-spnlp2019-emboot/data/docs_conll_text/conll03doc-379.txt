Ten people gunned down in northwest Colombia .
BOGOTA , Colombia 1996-08-25
Unidentified gunmen dragged 10 men out ot their homes in a rural area of Colombia 's northwest province of Antioquia and shot them to death , authorities said on Sunday .
Police said the killings occurred on Saturday morning in the municipality of Anza but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of Medellin early on Sunday .
Anza is only 20 miles ( 30 km ) west of Medellin , but there are no roads linking it directly to the city .
Police initially said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels were prime suspects in the killings .
But gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across Antioquia for years , and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group .

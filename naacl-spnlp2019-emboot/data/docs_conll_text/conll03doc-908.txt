CATANIA , Sicily 1996-08-29
Italian Police said on Thursday they had arrested five people in connection with the slaying of the daughter and 14-year-old nephew of a Mafia boss earlier this week .
Santa Puglisi , 22 , and Salvatore Botta were gunned down in a cemetery in this eastern Sicilian city on Tuesday in a crime which shocked even hardened anti-Mafia investigators .
The arrests followed a tip-off from a married couple who unexpectedly showed up at investigators ' offices on Wednesday . "
They wanted to get a weight off their consciences , " a police spokesman said .
He added the couple had also shed light on the murder last year of the wife of Mafia boss Nitto Santapaola .
Puglisi was shot as she knelt praying by the tomb of her young husband , who was himself killed last year in a Mafia ambush .
Botta , who had accompanied Puglisi to the cemetary , tried to flee the lone gunman but was caught and killed .

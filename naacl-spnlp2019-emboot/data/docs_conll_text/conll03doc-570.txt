Nicaraguan drunks fear " lovebite " bandit .
MANAGUA , Nicaragua 1996-08-27
Heavy drinkers in a Nicaraguan city were searching for someone who has covered them in " lovebites " while they were passed out in a drunken stupor , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday .
The dreaded " chupabolos " -- " drunksucker " -- preys on men who have passed out in the streets of Matagalpa , 80 miles ( 130 kms ) north of Managua , placing hickey-like " lovebites " on various parts of their bodies , El Nuevo Diario reported .
Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market .
The total number of victims was still unknown .
The first of the victims were two vagrants who slept in an abandoned car in front of a local bank , the newspaper said .
In spite of the collective fear gripping Matagalpa 's drinkers , local women expressed little sympathy .
" Its just desserts for all the ' bolos ' ( drunkards ) who sleep in the streets of our beautiful town , " said a woman who worked in the local market .

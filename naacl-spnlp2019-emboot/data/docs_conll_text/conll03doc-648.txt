ROWING - REDGRAVE MAY SEEK FIFTH OLYMPIC GOLD .
LONDON 1996-08-28
Britain 's Steven Redgrave said on Wednesday he might change his mind and go for a fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Games in Sydney .
Redgrave is one of only five athletes who have won gold medals at four successive Olympics .
He shared victory with Matthew Pinsent in the coxless pairs at the Atlanta Games and said at the time that would be his last shot .
But he has had second thoughts since then . "
I 'm only 34 .
Some say that 's too old for an athlete , " he said .
" But I 'll be 38 by Sydney and that 's not too old .
It 's whether I have got the enthusiasm for the training over the next four years .
Rowing is an endurance sport . "

# Automatic Correction of Syntactic Dependency Annotation Differences

## Highlights

Forthcoming!


## Data

Our base corpus is the GUM corpus.

Our augment corpus is the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, converted into UD format by (CLU Processors)[https://github.com/clulab/processors].


## Run

Before retraining our parsers, we need to (1) identify the mismatches between our two data sets, (2) convert the data, and (3) combine the converted data with our original training data.

### Get Mismatches

### Create Converted Training Files

For instance, policies for jobs may aim to improve compliance with rights, prosecuting forced labor and harmful forms of child labor.	A key question to ask is what purpose policies serve (figure 7.3). For instance, policies for jobs may aim to improve compliance with rights, prosecuting forced labor and harmful forms of child labor. Because fundamental labor rights and principles have been endorsed by most countries, promoting compliance with rights amounts to providing a global public good. Thus, interventions against human trafficking or child prostitution in one country are unlikely to have adverse effects in other countries and do not lead to a competition for jobs.	n

Agriculture occupies 44% of the workforce and accounts for 25% of the GDP.	Yield has increased steadily during the last five years, but in 2000 it was still low. The major constraints to sustainable rice production are * Imbalance in the use of crop inputs * The dominant use of varieties with high grain quality (basmati), especially in the Kalar tract PAKISTAN, a South Asian country facing the Arabian Sea, with 796,000 km2 in area, is largely mountainous and semiarid. However, on the eastern side, where Pakistan borders India, the Indus River runs nearly the full length of the country. Most agricultural activities are concentrated on its banks, as is most of the population. Arable land is around one-quarter of the total. Agriculture occupies 44% of the workforce and accounts for 25% of the GDP. The main crops are cotton and wheat. * Low plant populations * Waterlogging and salinity * Shortage of irrigation water * Yield losses caused by insects, pests, diseases, and weeds * Inadequate and inefficient postharvest operations * Cold damage to the rice crop because of cool air temperature and cold irrigation water in northern mountain areas Production season Planting Harvesting Main season May-Jul Oct-Nov Rice around the world 207 Basic statistics, Pakistan 1985 1990 1995 1998 1999 2000 Rice Area harvested (ha) 1,863,200 2,112,700 2,161,800 2,423,600 2,515,400 2,312,200 Yield (t/ha) 2.3 2.3 2.8 2.9 3.1 3.0 Production (t) 4,378,400 4,891,200 5,949,750 7,010,700 7,733,400 7,000,000 Rice imports (t) 7 25 68 854 1,471 na Paddy imports (t) 0 0 44 1 0 na Rice exports (t) 718,686 743,889 1,852,267 1,971,601 1,791,193 na Others Population, total (x103) 101,202 119,155 136,244 148,166 152,331 na Population, agriculture (x103) 61,579 66,220 72,360 76,579 78,021 na Agricultural area (x103 ha) 25,610 25,940 26,550 27,040 na na Irrigated agricultural area (x103 ha) 15,760 16,940 17,200 18,000 na na Total fertilizer consumption (t) 1,511,119 1,892,899 2,507,669 2,461,254 na na Tractors used in agric.

What is the language of the labeling?	"Branding, Labeling, and Packaging Consumers are concerned with both the product itself and the product's secondary features, such as packaging, warranties, and services. Branding and labeling products in foreign markets raise new considerations for your company, such as: * Are international brand names important to promote and distinguish a product? Conversely, should local brands or private labels be used to heighten local interest? * Are the colors used on labels and packages offensive or attractive to the foreign buyer? For example, in some countries certain colors are associated with death. * Can labels and instructions be produced in official or customary languages if required by law or practice? * Does information on product content and country of origin have to be provided? * Are weights and measures stated in the local unit? Even with consumer products, packaging and describing contents in metric measurements (e.g., kilograms, liters) can be important. * Must each item be labeled individually? What is the language of the labeling? For example, ""Made in the USA"" may not be acceptable; the product may need to be labeled in the language spoken by the country's consumers. There may be special labeling requirements for foods, pharmaceuticals, and other products. * Are local tastes and knowledge considered? A cereal box with the picture of a U.S. athlete on it may not be as attractive to overseas consumers as the picture of a local sports hero."	n

Sixty-five to seventy percent of its graduates settle in agriculture.	Overcome the financing gap. As highlighted in the rice value chain study, the ability of farmers and agribusinesses to invest is importantly determined by their access to financial services. Initiatives to expand access to finance in rural areas have as yet proven unsuccessful. Even microfinancial institutions (MFIs) devote only 5 percent of their portfolio to financing agriculture. As a result, only an estimated 14 percent of the rural population have access to formal financial services. A comprehensive agricultural finance diagnostic is called for. Successful development offinancial services will, among others, require a supportive legal and regulatory framework that enables the enforcement of legal contracts in the agricultural sector. Market-friendly government support mechanisms (such as partial credit guarantee schemes and public-private partnerships to encourage the development of agricultural insurance) will also be needed. 71 The training model followed by the Songhai agricultural training center in Porto Novo, Benin provides just one such example. It is locally owned and privately managed. Instruction favors application, with more than 75 percent of time devoted to practical subjects. Innovations in the training include creation of a business center of agricultural products and a credit program to help trainees establish themselves after training. About 20 percent of the trainees are women and 60 percent come from rural areas. Sixty-five to seventy percent of its graduates settle in agriculture. Other African institutes which successfully adapted their AET programs include Makerere in Uganda, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, as well as institutes in Mauritius.

For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children.	G P E 20 18 m ile st on e fo r pr im ar y (1 8. 3% ) GPE 2018 milestone for lower secondary (31.3%) ALB BFA BEN BTN CMR DJI ERI GEO GHA GIN GUY HND KGZ KHM LAO LSO MDA MRT MOZ NER PNG SSD STP UZB Non-FCACs FCACs CAF CIV ETH COM LBR MLI NPL PAK SDN SLE TLS ZWE YEM One of the key reasons why performance is poorer on out-ofschool rates than on completion rates, discussed above, is that the out-of-school rates include children who are in school but older than the official age range for their school level (that is, primary age or lower secondary age). When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.	n
According to the World Economic Forum, lack of trade finance represents one of the top three obstacles for exporters for half of the countries in the world.	In many developing countries and most of the poorest countries, alternatives to bank financing are scarce. When financing requests are rejected by banks, trade transactions are abandoned, the ADB study says, with 60 per cent of trade finance requests by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being rejected. This persistent trade finance gap represents a significant barrier to trade and for the global integration of developing countries through trade. According to the World Economic Forum, lack of trade finance represents one of the top three obstacles for exporters for half of the countries in the world.	n

On this basis, the GDG recommended that, in settings where the health workers operating at the front line of service delivery are CHWs, they should possess a polyvalent profile, enabling them to deliver a range of priority primary health care services.	Adopting an integrated and person-centred approach to primary health care (187), however, requires a health workforce configuration whereby health workers operating as first point of contact of the health system possess a relatively broad set of skills to enable them to better respond to population needs and demands for services, or refer them to the appropriate level of care when they are unable to do so directly. On this basis, the GDG recommended that, in settings where the health workers operating at the front line of service delivery are CHWs, they should possess a polyvalent profile, enabling them to deliver a range of priority primary health care services. Recognizing that some settings may present particular epidemiology situations, cultural contexts or health system requirements, the addition of more specialized CHWs, with clear division of roles vis-a-vis polyvalent CHWs, should be considered when aligned with public policy objectives and instrumental to the attainment of population health goals.	n

Procedures A procedure is defined as any interaction of the company founders with external parties (for example, government agencies, lawyers, auditors or notaries) or spouses (if legally required). Interactions between company founders or company officers and employees are not counted as procedures. Procedures that must be completed in the same building but in different offices or at different counters are counted as separate procedures. If founders have to visit the same office several times for different sequential procedures, each is counted separately. The founders are assumed to complete all procedures themselves, without middlemen, facilitators, accountants or lawyers, unless the use of such a third party is mandated by law or solicited by the majority of entrepreneurs. If the services of professionals are required, procedures conducted by such professionals on behalf of the company are counted as separate procedures. Each electronic procedure is counted as a separate procedure. Approvals from spouses to own a business or leave the home are considered procedures if required by law or if by failing to obtain such approval the spouse will suffer consequences under the law, such as the loss of right to financial maintenance. Obtaining permissions only required by one gender for company registration and operation, or getting additional documents only required by one gender for a national identification card are considered additional procedures. In that case, only procedures required for one spouse but not the other are counted. Both pre-and postincorporation procedures that are officially required or commonly done in practice for an entrepreneur to formally operate a business are recorded (table 8.3).	n

To understand why such a state persists it is necessary to identify the underlying contextual drivers of this situation.	Rice farmer resilience: contextual drivers The results presented above illustrate that the majority of rice farmers have limited resilience to climate hazards; they persist in Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ a livelihood system typified by low-productivity rice cropping and ineffective coping strategies. These livelihoods are susceptible to losses from climate hazards and do not generate resources that farmers can utilize in response to climate impacts. This is a partial explanation as to why rice farmers lack resilience; it does not answer what led to this state occurring nor fully explain why it persists. To understand why such a state persists it is necessary to identify the underlying contextual drivers of this situation. We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional, social, cultural, and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming. Our research suggested that these underlying contextual drivers were (i) the institutions surrounding land ownership, (ii) the nature of formal institutional support, (iii) lack of employment diversity, and (iv) expenses related to cultural activities.	n
For example, in the Middle East, indulging in small talk before engaging in the business at hand is standard practice.	Americans must pay close attention to different styles of doing business and the degree of importance placed on developing business relationships. In some countries, businesspeople have a very direct style, while in others they are more subtle and value personal relationships more than is customary in most U.S. business relationships.

The total Ecological Footprint of a nation or of humanity as a whole is a function of the number of people consuming, the quantity of goods and services an average person consumes, and the resource intensity of these goods and services.	Does the Ecological Footprint ignore the role of population growth as a driver in humanity's increasing consumption? The total Ecological Footprint of a nation or of humanity as a whole is a function of the number of people consuming, the quantity of goods and services an average person consumes, and the resource intensity of these goods and services. Since Footprint accounting is historical, it does not predict how any of these factors will change in the future. However, if population grows or declines (or any of the other factors change), this will be reflected in future Footprint accounts.	n

Domestic transport Domestic transport captures the time and cost associated with transporting the shipment from a warehouse in the largest business city of the economy to the most widely used seaport or land border of the economy. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city (table 8A.1). This set of procedures captures the time for (and cost of) the actual transport; any traffic delays and road police checks; as well as time spent on loading or unloading at the warehouse or border. For a coastal economy with an overseas trading partner, domestic transport captures the time and cost from the loading of the shipment at the warehouse until the shipment reaches the economy's port (figure 8.15). For an economy trading through a land border, domestic transport captures the time and cost from the loading of the shipment at the warehouse until the shipment reaches the economy's land border (figure 8.16).	n
This does not necessarily imply large-scale farming.	Mechanization remains limited. As urban and rural wages increase, pressures to mechanize will increase. This does not necessarily imply large-scale farming. Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization. They have been deployed successfully, most recently also in China, where land endowments are multiple times smaller.69 While not acute, the need for supporting smallholder mechanization within Coted'Ivoire and its implications for employment generation in agriculture deserves further investigation. 66 The 2011-2016 regional US$44 million West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), which Coted'Ivoire participates in and which is thefirst phase of a 10-year program, provides an initial step in addressing the staple crop productivity gap. The program focused on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops (plantain, rice, manioc, rice, maize, mango) and animal husbandry (chicken, pork). Regional research centers were set up, each focusing on one crop. The center in Coted'Ivoire focused on plantain. 67 WorldBank (2012a, 2014) provides a useful starting point. 68 Deininger et al.

The following are the major constraints to sustainable rice production in Chad: * Low temperature during the off-season in irrigated areas * Recurrent drought and flood in rainfed lowland areas * Lack of input supplies: improved seeds, fertilizer, and credit * Lack of small farm equipment, especially for postharvest operations * Lack of effective farmer organizations and cooperatives * Poor maintenance of irrigation facilities * Poor road networks and marketing systems * Weak research and extension support The Republic of CHAD is a landlocked country in the Sahel region of Africa.	National rice yields during 1995-2000 were among the world's lowest. The following are the major constraints to sustainable rice production in Chad: * Low temperature during the off-season in irrigated areas * Recurrent drought and flood in rainfed lowland areas * Lack of input supplies: improved seeds, fertilizer, and credit * Lack of small farm equipment, especially for postharvest operations * Lack of effective farmer organizations and cooperatives * Poor maintenance of irrigation facilities * Poor road networks and marketing systems * Weak research and extension support The Republic of CHAD is a landlocked country in the Sahel region of Africa. The country is divided into three regions: desert (the Sahara) in the north, occupying 40% of the total area; plains in the central part, used mainly for grazing; and fertile lands in the south that are more tropical and in which most of the population lives. Agriculture is a dominant force in the economy at 38% of GDP in 1998, with 85% of the population engaged in agricultural activities. Arable land, however, is only 3% of the total.	n
This would require raising yields through greater use of fertilizer, seeds, and mechanized implements, shifting the crop mix to more valuable crops and increasing the amount of land under cultivation.	There is clear upside potential for five major sectors of the Nigerian economy:  Retail and wholesale trade. Based on an expanding consumer class in Nigeria, retail and wholesale spending could rise strongly over the next few decades. This could make this the largest sector of the economy in the longer term and provides a particularly good opportunity for producers of fast-moving consumer items such as juices, which could grow by more than 10% per year up to 2030.  Agriculture. The sector, which is now the largest at 22% of GDP, could more than double in size by 2030. This would require raising yields through greater use of fertilizer, seeds, and mechanized implements, shifting the crop mix to more valuable crops and increasing the amount of land under cultivation.  Infrastructure. On average, the value of a nation's core infrastructure--roads, railways, ports, airports, the electrical system--is about 70% of GDP; in Nigeria, core infrastructure is estimated to be only around 35% - 40% of GDP. Its road network lags well behind other emerging economies such as China and even India. On a per capita basis, Nigeria has one-third the residential buildings of Indonesia and one-sixth of the commercial space. Between core infrastructure and real estate, total infrastructure investments in Nigeria could be as high as US$1.5trillion between 2014 and 2030. 26 World Bank: Ease of Doing Business Report, 2014 Will the shiftin global economic power continue? PwC  30  manufacturing. Manufacturing in Nigeria remains at a relatively early stage of development, contributing only around 7% of GDP in 2013. It has, however, achieved strong growth recently, with output rising by 13% per year from 2010 to 2013. Based on current trends, this could yield a four-fold increase in manufacturing output by 2030.  Oil and gas. While the oil and gas sector is expected to grow relatively modestly compared to other sectors, and remains vulnerable to global price fluctuations as seen recently, its success is still important for the Nigerian economy. With the right reforms, liquids production could increase from 2.35m barrels a day on average now to over 3m barrels a day by 2030, while natural gas output could grow at around 6% per annum to 2030.	n

So are some cultural sites, especially World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.	How do you categorise World Heritage sites and Biosphere reserves? All new and most existing natural World Heritage sites are protected areas and comply with the IUCN definition of a protected area. So are some cultural sites, especially World Heritage Cultural Landscapes. Some countries have older natural World Heritage sites that are not regarded as protected areas or contain parts that are outside protected areas. Categories should be assigned in a similar manner to other protected areas whilst noting the special emphasis that is given to managing to maintain the site's outstanding universal value as the basis for inscription. The IUCN definition should equally be applied to Man and Biosphere Reserves as part of the category assignment process. In most cases this would apply to core areas and in many cases also to buffer zones (often with different categories); however, transition zones are often managed for purposes of sustainable use and may not comply (see 2008 Guidelines, Chapter 7, for discussion of the categories and international designations).

If BAT's total global market share is 10.7% according to the 2016 Euromonitor (123), then that means that total emissions due to tobacco are roughly 8.76 million CO2 equivalent - which amounts to the emissions of nearly 3 million transatlantic flights. Other sorts of emissions also are unknown. China's edition of Fortune magazine, for example, reports that for CNTC, ""... total industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide, [are] 5688 metric tonnes, down 29.8%; chemical oxygen demand emissions [are] 2751 metric tonnes, down 11.7%"" (124).

It is unclear whether these are government fines for polluting or other costs, and Jia Yao's percent market share in the overall Chinese tobacco market is not certain. Jia Yao purports to comply with China's Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Solid Waste Pollution and Law of the People's Republic of China on the Promotion of Clean Production.

Use of technologies adaptable/appropriate to Senegal include local clays, UV light for aflatoxin detoxification by cottage level peanut processors, peanut milk and protein isolates for protein deficient children, and fish by-products used to produce high protein peanut-based snacks. Peanut-based fish nuggets could enable recovery of fish by-products in Senegal and the U.S., where fishing industries are strong, and add value thereby enhancing both the fish and peanut industries. Product development: Two high-protein baked snacks from defatted peanut flour were developed and tested in the U.S. and Senegal: (1) cookies, and (2) chin-chin (a West African snack). Substitution of up to 40% roasted defatted peanut flour yielded snacks that was most acceptable to consumers. U.S. and West African sensory panels tested both snacks; the West African panel gave higher acceptability ratings to peanut-based snacks especially chin-chin compared to the U.S. panel. Shelf-life of chin-chin was determined to be good. The high protein-low fat products have health implications. Peanut milk from defatted peanut flour is being developed in Senegal by collaborating researchers for testing for acceptance by Senegalese consumers. Assessment of the level of aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products in Senegal, through sampling, was carried out. The results provided baseline on health risks to consumers and provide guidance on ways to reduce aflatoxin especially at the village/small-scale processor level. Aflatoxin detoxification: B1 and G1 Aflatoxin detoxification of peanut products using Senegalese Attapulgite clay was tested in Senegal in collaboration with NCA&T researchers. Addition of clay as low as 0.5% level resulted to non-detectable levels of aflatoxin in all samples. Samples of all peanut products in local markets in Senegal showed aflatoxin contamination; the products showing high levels of over 30% were: crude peanut oil (92%), peanut cake (90%), and peanut paste (55%), and kernels in local market (30%). Sorting and removal of skins proved effective in lowering aflatoxin for some uses, and the utilization of the Senegalese attapulgite clay reduced aflatoxin to none detectable levels in other uses of peanut.	n

What are the most important guidelines that the Footprint can currently offer?	What are the most important guidelines that the Footprint can currently offer? There are a number of countries where purchasing power is not as high as in Germany. A bigger portion of their population lives subsistence lives. When resources become scarce in these countries, it immediately translates into less food or fewer chances to cut timber. Water shortages appear, et cetera. So what is the defining problem for the country's future? Some point at water, for others it is biodiversity, yet others name climate change or soil degradation. The point is that these problems are related. They are symptoms of the same dynamic: our growing hunger for resources.	n
Some of the documented environmental damage to the ecosystems of the region includes: reduction in plant species richness and stream flow, and alteration of the nutrient status of soils.	A wide range of trees species were introduced into southern Africa (South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) for a wide range of purposes. Unfortunately some of these species have become invasive, threatening the biodiversity of the region. Some of the documented environmental damage to the ecosystems of the region includes: reduction in plant species richness and stream flow, and alteration of the nutrient status of soils. In South Africa, an estimated 100,739 km2 (i.e. 8.07% of the country s total area) has been affected by invasive alien tree species. Figures are not readily available for Zimbabwe, but an estimate of 4,500 km2 invaded by non-native trees would be a conservative figure. Zambia is considered to relatively affected by invasive alien tress, although lack of awareness could be contributing to this notion. Control programmes for invasive alien tree species in Zimbabwe and South Africa cost US $100 000 and US $20 million annually, respectively.	n

Countries also need to be aware of the differentiated needs of female and male health workers and ensure they are motivated and supported through occupational health programmes, remuneration, insurance, childcare if needed, and psychosocial support.	Effective response requires a strong, committed, well-distributed, and skilled workforce that is supported, protected, recognised, and encouraged, particularly given the emotional strain during emergencies. Support is particularly important for female health workers, who make up an estimated 70% of the world's global health and social sector workforce (WEF, 2020). Many often have to balance increased family pressures as well as the increased workload related to pandemic response (O'Donnell et al., 2020). In addition, their safety may be compromised by a combination of high-risk environments and a lack of PPE (WEF, 2020). For COVID-19, requirements include provision for surge capacity, adjusting roles and actions as needed, and ongoing capacity building.

"Through mining and combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, maintenance of livestock herds, and even through rice cultivation, people have released enormous quantities of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and other ""greenhouse"" gases into the atmosphere."	"For the first time in history, climate appears to be changing as a direct result of human activity. People have released chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere, thereby degrading stratospheric ozone and increasing biologically harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches Earth's surface. Through mining and combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, maintenance of livestock herds, and even through rice cultivation, people have released enormous quantities of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and other ""greenhouse"" gases into the atmosphere. Samples from ice cores show that past fluctuations in global temperatures were strongly correlated with concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 .

Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries.	The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country. We measure the level of tourism service infrastructure through the number of hotel rooms complemented by the extent of access to services such as car rentals and ATMs.	n
TRADING ACROSS BORDERS Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods.	TRADING ACROSS BORDERS Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business measures the time and cost (excluding tariffs) associated with three sets of procedures--documentary compliance, border compliance and domestic transport--within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. Figure 8.15, using the example of Brazil (as exporter) and China (as importer), shows the process of exporting a shipment from a warehouse in the origin economy to a warehouse in an overseas trading partner through a port. Figure 8.16, using the example of Kenya (as exporter) and Uganda (as importer), shows the process of exporting a shipment from a warehouse in the origin economy to a warehouse in a regional trading partner through a land border. The ranking of economies DOING BUSINESS 2019110 on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their scores for trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the scores for the time and cost for documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (figure 8.17).	n

If the dispersion observed within each industry narrowed to the point of matching the dispersion observed in the United States, India's average productivity in manufacturing could increase by more than half.123 Instead, despite India's buoyant economic growth during the past two decades, the performance of the labor-intensive manufacturing sector has been sluggish.	"India is arguably an example of a country whose complex and cumbersome labor policies have pushed it offthe ""plateau."" The country has more than 40 national and state-level labor laws. Most of them apply to the organized (or formal) sector and to firms above a certain size. As firms' employment increases, they fall under the purview of a growing number of regulations.121 The Industrial Disputes Act (Ida) of 1947 is particularly restrictive. Governing employee-employer relationships, the IDA makes it extremely difficult for firms to terminate employment.122 The stringency of labor regulations is consistent with the ""missing middle"" phenomenon, characteristic of India and other developing countries, where medium-size businesses make up a disproportionately small share of the total. Also consistent with the stringency of labor regulations is the substantial dispersion of productivity. If the dispersion observed within each industry narrowed to the point of matching the dispersion observed in the United States, India's average productivity in manufacturing could increase by more than half.123 Instead, despite India's buoyant economic growth during the past two decades, the performance of the labor-intensive manufacturing sector has been sluggish.124 The bulk of the growth in nonfarm employment has been in the informal sector."	n

This underpins the growth of national and individual wealth, and helps drive economic development.	Developing economies require access to English There are a number of clear unifying factors between the countries selected for this research despite their diverse geographical location. All are developing nations, attempting to set in place growth strategies and reposition themselves in the new global economy. An important element of these growth strategies is recognition of the importance of English, in order to communicate in the international business world. A focus on improved language skills has helped to attract more foreign investment, further increasing the need for English speakers in these countries. This underpins the growth of national and individual wealth, and helps drive economic development. Workers with solid English language skills are therefore in the best position to take the fullest advantage of new opportunities in these rapidly developing economies. Demand for English language education is driven by a number of factors. These include inward investment (with international companies typically using English for internal communication), ambitious individuals looking to sharpen their competitive edge in the labour market, as well as government efforts to encourage business investment by allocating greater budgets to the teaching of English. The level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is significant. FDI increased by an average of 6% over .	n

The US has greatly increased its investment in Nigeria in recent years. In March 2010 a business forum for US investors was organised with the aim of attracting more FDI into the Nigerian economy. Key industries for US investment in Nigeria include tourism and hospitality, power and energy, solid minerals, agriculture, infrastructure and construction, and telecommunications. This is a sign that English language skills may be required in the country and will eventually, if not immediately, positively affect the country in terms of both improvement of individuals' quality of life and economic growth.	n

This chapter follows the environmental consequences of lighting, smoking and discarding a cigarette - a process that takes minutes but whose consequences last a lifetime.	At the same time, transnational tobacco companies clearly respond to public outcry and pressure. In countries where environmental sustainability is an important political issue, transnational tobacco companies trumpet their ecological modernization - which is in fact a process of rationalizing production to save money while adopting some greener technologies (138). In countries with less oversight, this does not happen. Holding the tobacco industry accountable - everywhere, not just in countries where environmental concerns have high visibility - and establishing a core set of environmental indicators is vital to obtain a fair assessment of the product's true cost and to start to take action to reduce it. 20/ To b a c c o a n d i t s e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t : a n o v e r v i e w 3 Consumption Tobacco smoke pollutes indoor and outdoor environments and remains a pervasive and persistent source of toxicants long after the cigarette has been extinguished.

In Tajikistan, this discourse and its application was used to punish LGBTI communities for ""amoral"" behaviours and enforce ""norms"" for dress code, language and religion primarily against women and religious minorities, including through new legislation. In Kazakhstan and Russia, there was an increasing number of criminal prosecutions and other harassment of religious minorities, on arbitrary grounds, under ""anti-extremism"" legislation.

The degree of variance between schools differs across countries.	"Learning disparities begin in early grades and remain throughout primary education. There is a very strong correlation between the rural/urban parity index for learning in early grades (grade 2 or 3) and at the end of primary education (grade 6).b In other words, countries with huge disparities in early grades are rarely able to make up their lost ground later on. a. While some studies demonstrate that learning mathematics does not necessarily require reading skills, a vast majority of research findings show that reading is key to learning mathematics (G. Fite, ""Reading and Math: What Is the Connection?""; H. Korpershoek, H. Kuyper, and G. Van Der Werf, ""The relation between students' math and reading ability and their mathematics, physics, and chemistry examination grades in secondary education""). b.

Across the 10 countries with PASEC data, 45 percent of the schools were underperforming with fewer than 20 percent of their students achieving minimum proficiency level, while in other schools the majority of students achieved minimum proficiency levels (see Appendix F). The degree of variance between schools differs across countries. For example, in Chad and Niger more than 80 percent of schools are underperforming, while this figure is only 1 percent in Burundi. The vast majority (88.7 percent) of the underperforming schools are located in rural areas, and a majority (53.1 percent) of the students in these underperforming schools come from the poorest 40 percent households."	n

Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security.	Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security. Irreversible damage to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they provide, worsened by air, soil, water, and marine pollution.  Extreme weather events, many worsened by accelerating sea level rise, will particularly affect urban coastal areas in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Damage to communication, energy, and transportation infrastructure could affect low-lying military bases, inflict economic costs, and cause human displacement and loss of life.  Changes in the frequency and variability of heat waves, droughts, and floods--combined with poor governance practices--are increasing water and food insecurity around the world, increasing the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jordan.  Diminishing Arctic sea ice may increase competition--particularly with Russia and China-- over access to sea routes and natural resources. Nonetheless, Arctic states have maintained mostly positive cooperation in the region through the Arctic Council and other multilateral mechanisms, a trend we do not expect to change in the near term. Warmer temperatures and diminishing sea ice are reducing the high cost and risks of some commercial activities and are attracting new players to the resource-rich region. In 2018, the minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic was 25 percent below the 30-year average from 1980 to 2010. Regional threats .	n

In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results.	"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month?

Teacher shortages and overcrowded students in schools help to make a large market for private tutoring throughout Bangladesh.	"Teacher shortages and overcrowded students in schools help to make a large market for private tutoring throughout Bangladesh. The rate of primary school students accessing private supplementary tutoring increased two percentage points per year over the past decade, reaching 31 percent of students in 2005 (Richards, 2008, p.19). According to the 2006 Education Watch Report, an estimated 43 percent of students in government primary schools had private tutors (Richards, 2008, p.19). Although, most of the time private tutoring receives grater among boys, urban students, and wealthier households but it is also seen to receive private tutoring even among the poorest families. A study by BRAC's Research and Evaluation Division finds that supplementary tutoring in Bangladesh helps students learn more than those who have no such support (Richards, 2008, p.19). Private tutors for primary school students have become a wellaccepted norm. Bangladesh is not the only country which only depends on tutors. The World Bank reports that tutors have become a pillar of education in many developing countries. It finds that ""private tutoring boosts student academic performance. Tutoring lessons are found to increase test scores in India, mean matriculation rates in Israel, the quality of colleges in which students can enroll in Japan, both SAT and ACT test scores (except for ACT reading scores) and academic performance in the United States, and student academic performance in Vietnam.""

Asadullah, ""School Access, Resources, and Learning Outcomes: Evidence from a Non-formal School Program in Bangladesh""). b. Given a selected set of input and output variables, DEA estimates a frontier of best practices. It is a relative measure. The most efficient schools are on the frontier and the efficiency of the other schools is evaluated by measuring the distance to this empirical frontier, and a score between 0 and 1 is given to each school. The higher the efficiency score, the closest is the distance to the frontier and the more efficient is the school. A total of six inputs and two outputs have been included in the analysis. c. The DEA results show that returns to scale are increasing in these schools. An increase in the school resources would lead to a higher than proportional increase in learning outcomes. 21. Results for Lesotho and Tanzania are linked to their participation in the regional assessment program Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), which has not had a round of evaluations recently.

This more granular knowledge is fundamental for our long-term security, and is also part of our research agenda.	During the so called green revolution of the past years and decades massive amounts of artificial fertilizer was put on fields throughout the world which led to higher biocapacity. But ultimately that is fossil energy, because fertilizer is produced from natural gas. The criticism is; fossil energy sources are finite. The harvests are therefore unsustainable, consequently, the Footprint is calculating with unrealistic numbers. We measure the amount of biocapacity that the Earth provides every year. If the biocapacity decreases because the inputs are no longer there or the soils are leached out or not enough water is available, then these will be shown in future accounts - through declining biocapacity. Our numbers are not predictive; rather, we document the way things are, year by year. Our analysis could be supplemented with more detailed in-country data, or by evaluating how much of today's biocapacity might become fragile in the future due to fossil fuel shortages, soil depletion or freshwater shortages. This more granular knowledge is fundamental for our long-term security, and is also part of our research agenda.	n

The victim's family brought a civil case of murder against the LMPS, which sought an out-of-court settlement.	On 28 April, Tumelo Mohlomi, a student from the University of Lesotho was killed when she was shot in the back of the head by a Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) officer while she was in a restaurant outside the campus. A police officer was arrested after the killing and apparently released on bail. The victim's family brought a civil case of murder against the LMPS, which sought an out-of-court settlement. The National Police Commissioner said that a criminal investigation into the case was ongoing. In August the High Court ruled in favour of a habeas corpus application brought by the family of Mokalekale Khetheng who disappeared on 26 March 2016 after arrest on unspecified charges by four LMPS officers in Leribe District. In August, the police officers were arrested in connection with his murder; Mokalekale Khetheng's body was exhumed. The former Minister of Defence was then arrested in connection with the murder. He and the officers were also charged with conspiracy to cause a disappearance. The former Minister was released on bail in September. The former National Police Commissioner, who remained abroad throughout the year, was apparently implicated in the case although he was not charged. On 5 September, Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) Commander Khoantle Motsomotso was shot dead in his office at the LDF headquarters in the capital, Maseru. Two suspects in the killing, LDF members Brigadier Bulane Sechele and Colonel Tefo Hashatsi, also died in retaliatory fire. The Prime Minister announced an investigation into the incident. No further information about the progress of the investigation had been received by the end of the year.	n
For 2016, producing countries indicated that they plan to increase production.	ChaPTER ii. fuNCTIONINg of ThE INTERNaTIONal dRug CONTROl sysTEm 17 99. The global production of opiate raw materials rich in morphine has exceeded the global demand for those raw materials since 2009. As a result, stocks have been increasing, albeit with fluctuations. In 2014, stocks decreased to 495 tons in morphine equivalent and were sufficient to cover the expected global demand for about 13 months. In 2015, global production of opiate raw materials rich in morphine is expected to exceed global demand again, with the result that global stocks of those raw materials will further increase in 2016. Stocks are expected to reach 661 tons by the end of 2015, which is equivalent to about 17 months of expected global demand at the 2016 level of demand (although not all data are available to have a complete forecast). For 2016, producing countries indicated that they plan to increase production. Stocks are anticipated to reach about 920 tons at the end of 2016, sufficient to cover several months in excess of one year of expected global demand. The global supply of opiate raw materials rich in morphine (stocks and production) will remain fully sufficient to cover global demand. 100. In 2014, global production of opiate raw materials rich in thebaine was again higher than demand, leading to an increase in stocks (287 tons) at the end of 2014, equivalent to global demand for 14 months. Production is expected to increase in 2015 and then to decrease in 2016. By the end of 2015, global stocks of opiate raw materials rich in thebaine will likely reach 423 tons, sufficient to cover global demand for about 20 months, and at the end of 2016 may reach 472 tons, sufficient to cover global demand for several months in excess of one year. The global supply of opiate raw materials rich in thebaine (stocks and production) will be more than sufficient to cover global demand in 2015 and 2016.	n

Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works.

Owning land (p < 0.05), operating a larger area of land (p < 0.05), and being able to sell fruit produce (p < 0.05) reduced the odds of households using a larger share of their rice harvest for own consumption (Table 3).	Household survey data identified that rice cropping is predominantly a subsistence activity. The majority of households surveyed used harvested rice for subsistence; 68% of households used between 75% and 100% of harvested rice for own consumption (Table 1). For many households rice harvests do not meet annual household needs; 79% of households' rice harvest lasted less than nine months (Table 2). Cultivating a larger area of land (p < 0.05) and engaging in nonagricultural formal employment (p < 0.1) increased the odds of rice harvests meeting household needs for a longer period of time (Table 3).

The main law enforcement agency is the police under the Ministry of Home Affairs with 539 police regions or 'thanas' across the country. The Police Act of 1861 governs policy administration with operational aspects guided by the Policy Regulation of Bengal 1943. Other enforcement agencies include the Chaukidars and Dafadars (village police), Ansars and Village Defence Party, Bangladesh Rifles (paramilitary force charged with border protection and prevention of smuggling) and the Rapid Action Battalion (charged with crime control, confiscation of illegal arms, trafficking, money laundering, etc.). Both TIB surveys and a BBC Survey in 2005 confirmed that Bangladeshis have very little trust in the police. The major problems for the police include the role that politics plays in the transfer and posting of police officers. Working conditions are quite poor, and training and career opportunities reserved for senior level officers police do not attract sufficiently skilled and motivated staff. There is no support system for police and their families, housing and medical facilities for lower ranks are poor and welfare benefits in the case of accidents or death are not distributed in a timely manner. Other concerns relate to operational issues, e.g. the excessive workload and lack of operating budget for police stations.78 77 Ferdous J., From Rule of Law to Legal Empowerment of the Poor in Bangladesh: Towards an Agenda for Change. 78 Centre for governance studies. 2006.

The education system comprises of 3 stages, namely primary, secondary and tertiary education, with the rural poor falling away as years passed. The intention is that children enter the former at age 7, and remain there for 6 years, while they learn the basics of the same subjects that children learn everywhere. The secondary school model is a 2-tier one. After the first 4 of 7 years, examinations are held for the certificate of the lower cycle of secondary study, or brevet d'etude du premier cycle. With this in hand, students could go out to work, move on to a college or lycee, or enter a teacher-training institution. Those who remain on at secondary school for the balance of the period are entitled to apply to study at a university, if either of such exist.

Resource-rich countries face similar pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and the commodity booms of the last few years have only made these pressures stronger. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance are needed to jump-start development, cope with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact on export diversification.77 An enabling business environment. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase, is the top constraint in low-and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets have the potential to allocate resources toward more productive uses, thwart the channeling of resources to those with political connections or economic power, and expand financial in- those jobs. If this is the case, policies should remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily removed, offsetting them may be an option, but the costs and benefits of doing so need to be carefully assessed.	n

In addition to meeting national rice demand, the NRDS is projected to create (a) 500,000 direct jobs for the production of paddy using irrigated system; (b) 1.5 million direct jobs for paddy production in rainfed condition; (c) more than 500,000 direct jobs in related manufacturing and services.	Among processors, both the lack of sufficient supply of rice and cost and shortage of electricity are frequently mentioned as major constraints. This holds back investment and quality processing needed to compete with imports. Traders are generally underfinanced, and as a result, poorly equipped with regard to weighing equipment and vehicles, with lack of access to credit even more pronounced with women traders. Among producers, there is little optimal use of agricultural inputs such as improved seed, fertilizers, and pesticides (Table 3.2). Adequate water control (both to avoid flooding as well as drought) remains a great challenge. Only 16 percent of the area planted with rice has relatively good water control. And technical support remains deficient. As a 65 In particular, it seeks to (a) enhance producers' access to improved seeds, irrigation, agricultural inputs, and mechanization; (b) promote processing units close to production areas; (c) promote more private investment in the rice sector; 4) regularize and secure rice prices both at the production, processing and marketing level.

Conflict environments range from situations with high levels of criminal violence to The labor productivity of workers in well-managed firms in Ethiopia is comparable with that in China and Vietnam, although wages are only a quarter of those in China and half those in Vietnam.	Conflict environments range from situations with high levels of criminal violence to The labor productivity of workers in well-managed firms in Ethiopia is comparable with that in China and Vietnam, although wages are only a quarter of those in China and half those in Vietnam. Ethiopia thus has the potential to compete globally in apparel thanks to a significant and growing labor cost advantage. It is also close to a state-of-the-art and well-located container port in Djibouti and has duty-free access to the markets of the European Union and the United States. The binding constraint on Ethiopia's competitiveness in apparel is poor trade logistics, which wipe out its labor cost advantage and cut the country off from the higher-value time-sensitive segments of the market. Establishing a fast-track channel for moving apparel through customs, providing free and immediate access to foreign exchange, reducing the cost of letters of credit, and setting up an industrial zone closer to Djibouti would alleviate the most important trade logistics bottlenecks. These steps would also put Ethiopia in a position to attract investors to lead the industry in the same way that China and Vietnam have done.	n
The host country's ability to regulate or control the distribution, storage, use, and disposal of the requested pesticide The intent of this factor is to examine the host country's existing infrastructure and human resources for managing the use (from import to disposal) of proposed pesticides.	This PERSUAP requests that a wide range of active ingredients be approved (Attachment A, Table 2). They cover a range of pesticide families. If a pesticide in Attachment A, Table 2 is registered by the host country, and if it is available in-country, volunteers have a range of active ingredients to choose from. Accordingly, the pesticides of choice should be the least toxic alternatives. And pesticides should be used as a last resort control measure, in accordance with IPM principles. In addition, biological and organic pesticides should be investigated and encouraged. These principles and practices are included in Attachment F. 3.9 Factor j. The host country's ability to regulate or control the distribution, storage, use, and disposal of the requested pesticide The intent of this factor is to examine the host country's existing infrastructure and human resources for managing the use (from import to disposal) of proposed pesticides. If the host country's ability to regulate pesticides is inadequate, assistance for the use or procurement of pesticides could harm the environment. However, in the absence of adequate government management of the pesticide sector, expert volunteer technical assistance can be expected to provide potential improvement in the safe use of pesticides.	n

It is vital because exporters wish to be paid when goods are shipped while importers do not want to pay before they receive the merchandise. This can be a major problem in view of the fact that cargos from Europe to Asia may take up to 80 days. Financial institutions can help to bridge the gap between importers and exporters by providing payment solutions while taking the credit risk. Very little international trade is actually paid as cash in advance.

It can be instrumental for future planning and investments, be it on a local, regional, national, or international level. By presenting complex data in a graphic, easily understood manner, it is also an effective tool for educational and communication activities. In the following section we want to present the use of the Footprint in the educational work of GTZ. But we will also cast light on how it is employed as an essential component and source of inspiration for the discussions and creative activities of the International Youth Summit ""Go 4 BioDiv"" and in diverse environmental education facilities and institutions in Germany and Austria."	n

Capital can be invested in further developing agriculture (new seeds, better jobs, new technologies), or invested in schools, hospitals, and roads.	"The Footprint is like a pair of glasses. With them you see certain things more clearly, while other things can look blurry. What can someone do with the tool? The Footprint is an accounting system for a world in which ecological issues are gaining importance. This differentiates the 20th from the 21st century. Previously, it may have been adequate just to focus on financial capital because that form of capital was the most limiting production factor. That was the era of the Gross Domestic Product. In the 21st century resources will become increasingly scarce. For this reason we need more complete you ever heard of so called ""banana republics"" or ""cash crops"" in this context""?

Train governmental officials and service providers on the need and availability of assistive technology to deliver high quality services for persons with disabilities. 5) Invest in the environment to optimize the benefits of assistive technology. Although assistive products have the potential to improve quality of life and participation in society, success cannot be guaranteed. Accessibility of the environment is a precondition for using certain assistive products, for example, ramps and wide doorways can enable the effective use of a wheelchair.550,551 Measures should be taken to ensure that assistive products can be used effectively, such as hearing loops for hearing aid users.552 In addition to accessibility, assistive products need to meet the preferences and expectations of a user to be effective.553 6) Monitor unmet needs for assistive technology to identify and fill the gaps. Little research has been conducted on population-level needs for assistive products, policies, service provision models, implementation and cost-effectiveness. There is a need to monitor progress in meeting these needs for assistive products and reducing the barriers to access. Promoting inclusion of persons with disabilities through deinstitutionalization Social, economic and political inclusion of persons with disabilities is hampered by placing persons with disabilities in institutions or special homes for persons with disabilities, where they remain excluded from society and deprived of their liberty. Often, persons with disabilities living in institutions are not able to obtain an education, cannot exercise their right to vote and are not empowered to make their own decisions.	n

The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association is in discussion with a coalition of UN agencies and other organisations to upgrade production facilities, while sourcing certified virus-proof fabric from China (Dhaka Tribune, 2020).	In Bangladesh, there are no provisions in the national preparedness plan for any emergency supply chain management. Instead, procurement continues to use forecasts by the respective hospital directorate office. While there was adequate stock of consumables and drugs at the beginning of the outbreak, logistics surge capacity is limited. However, the government has procured 1.5 million items of PPE from international and national markets by 24 April, with more in the pipeline. After distribution, the PPE inventory as at 24 April amounted to 0.27 million items. The procurement department is presently struggling to procure a standards-compliant particulate respirator (N-95 or equivalent) internationally, reflecting the global shortage of quality PPE. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has started converting existing production capabilities to PPE equipment locally. Given present limitations of access to virus-proof fabric, local factories can only produce waterproof equipment, which has obtained government approval for the intended level of protection. This lower-grade equipment has been deployed for use by support workers, leaving valuable virus-proof resources for frontline workers. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association is in discussion with a coalition of UN agencies and other organisations to upgrade production facilities, while sourcing certified virus-proof fabric from China (Dhaka Tribune, 2020). However, there are presently no adequate arrangements to safely dispose of the vastly increased volume of medical waste. Meanwhile, Bangladesh has started production of a generic version of remdesivir, an antiviral drug that has shown promise in the treatment of COVID-19.	n

Capital Pool Company (CPC) program, TSX Venture Exchange, Canada The Capital Pool Company (CPC) program at TSX Venture Exchange provides a unique listing vehicle to experienced investors and growth-oriented entrepreneurs. The program introduces investors with financial market experience to entrepreneurs whose growth and development-stage companies require capital and public company management expertise. Unlike a traditional IPO, the CPC program enables seasoned directors and officers to form a Capital Pool Company with no assets other than cash and no commercial operations, list it on TSX Venture Exchange, and raise a pool of capital. The CPC then uses these funds to seek out an investment opportunity in a growing business. Within 24 months, the CPC identifies an appropriate business as its ""qualifying transaction"" and issues a news release to announce that it has entered an agreement in principle to acquire the business. Once the CPC has completed its ""qualifying transaction"" and acquired an operating company which meets the Exchange listing requirements, its shares continue trading as a regular listing on the Exchange."	n

Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization.	Mechanization remains limited. As urban and rural wages increase, pressures to mechanize will increase. This does not necessarily imply large-scale farming. Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization. They have been deployed successfully, most recently also in China, where land endowments are multiple times smaller.69 While not acute, the need for supporting smallholder mechanization within Coted'Ivoire and its implications for employment generation in agriculture deserves further investigation. 66 The 2011-2016 regional US$44 million West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), which Coted'Ivoire participates in and which is thefirst phase of a 10-year program, provides an initial step in addressing the staple crop productivity gap. The program focused on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops (plantain, rice, manioc, rice, maize, mango) and animal husbandry (chicken, pork). Regional research centers were set up, each focusing on one crop. The center in Coted'Ivoire focused on plantain. 67 WorldBank (2012a, 2014) provides a useful starting point. 68 Deininger et al.

Agriculture, mainly at a subsistence level, makes up almost the entire GDP, although only about 13% of the land is arable.	Rice yield has stagnated since 1995. In some irrigated areas, a yield decrease has been reported. The following are the major constraints to sustainable rice production in Burkina Faso: * Drought in upland areas and drought and flash floods in rainfed lowland (or inland swamp) areas because of irregular weather * Heat-induced sterility during the off-season in irrigated areas * Cold-induced sterility in December * Dominant use of NPK fertilizer formulated for cotton and not adapted to the rice crop * Inadequate and irregular input supplies: seeds, fertilizer, and credit * Lack of small farm equipment, especially for postharvest operations * Lack of effective farmer organizations and cooperatives * Poor maintenance of irrigation facilities * Lack of a well-defined rice policy * Poor road networks and marketing systems * Labor shortage because of competition from other agricultural activities * Weak research and extension support BURKINA FASO, previously Upper Volta, is a landlocked country bordered by Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Togo. Its 11.6 million people (in 1999) live in an area totaling 274,000 km2, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the Sahel. The land consists of rolling plains dissected by valleys formed by upper reaches of the Volta River. Agriculture, mainly at a subsistence level, makes up almost the entire GDP, although only about 13% of the land is arable. Further, substantial desertification has occurred as a result of previous inappropriate farming techniques used for peanuts and cotton for export.

Confusions at times arise in policy discussions and public debates on employment in developing countries, including in Coted'Ivoire. Some of the formal definitions that are used to characterize a labor market where individuals look for wage jobs and employers supply these wage jobs are not well suited to contexts where self-employment in agricultural and nonagricultural activities predominate, and few individuals are not working and are instead looking for wage jobs. The overall jobs diagnostic is based on the official international employment definitions as they are adopted by Coted'Ivoire.4 Box 1.2 provides definitions of terms used throughout the report. In line with international norms, an individual is considered employed if she works at least one hour over the previous seven days. An individual is considered unemployed if she works less than one hour in the last 7 days, is actively looking for work, and is available to work in the next 15 days.	n

As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries.	Health worker migration in response to the global shortage of health professionals demands dedicated and effective management, including building the capacity of health systems in origin countries, promotion of good practices and prevention of negative effects of health worker migration. There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.	n
In industrial countries, some of the more resounding successes, from Honda to Microsoft, started in garages.	Jobs and productivity 111 a multinational conglomerate comprising 114 companies and subsidiaries across 8 business sectors on several continents.49 Many of China's successful clusters, such as the footwear and electric appliance industry in Wenzhou, also started from small family businesses working close to each other.50 A vibrant firm life cycle is often missing, however. Larger and older firms tend to be stagnant, while smaller enterprises are prone to churning. In Ghana, for example, many firms are born large and show little growth over 15 years (figure 3.12). In Portugal, by contrast, not all born large. In industrial countries, some of the more resounding successes, from Honda to Microsoft, started in garages. And many successful companies in developing countries also grew out of small household businesses. Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Group, founded in 1921 as a small seed shop in Bangkok by two brothers, has grown into one of the world's largest multinational conglomerates in agribusiness, operating in 15 countries and encompassing close to 100 companies.48 India's Tata Group transformed from a Mumbai-based, familyowned trading firm in the late 19th century to Sources: Cabral and Mata 2003; Sandefur 2010.	n

Limited reliance on hired labor is due to the difficulty to monitor effort, and without machinery, farms cannot be expanded beyond the size manageable by the family's labor, which is typically 1 to 2 hectares.18 Family farms dominate even in high-income countries, and owner cultivation is the most common form of land tenure, especially in Asia (figure 3.6).	In family farms, hired labor is usually employed in simple tasks such as weeding and harvesting, whereas family labor usually carries out care-intensive activities such as water management, land preparation, and fertilizer application.

Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit.	The early literature on empowerment typically used one global measure for empowerment. For example, parents' education was often used to measure agency or decision-making within the household (Alkire 2007); husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981). However, it is possible that agency differs across different spheres of life and can exist simultaneously in different ways. For example, a person can be fully employed as a wife and mother, excluded from the labor force by social conventions, and recently empowered to vote by political processes. Because such distinctions have policy relevance, it is important to identify and compare agency achievements in different domains rather than in one alone (Alkire 2007, 166). Because agency and empowerment are experienced with different tasks and can be described and measured with different domains, Alkire (2005) suggests that most measures of agency and empowerment should be domain specific. For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1. Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment. 2. Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit. 3. Income: This dimension concerns sole or joint control over the use of income and expenditures. 4. Leadership: This dimension concerns leadership in the community, here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public. 5. Time: This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities.	n

The first challenge was the effec,ve distribu,on of all devices to students without causing any delay to their par,cipa,on in the online courses. The second challenge we faced was to procure a system and system infrastructure capable of to accommodate more than 120,000 students. The third challenge was the ability of employees to manage the interac,on with the remote support specialists in case of problems faced with the remote working tools. The last challenge we faced, was the ability of some students to access their online courses, and to monitor their actual a&endance. In order to address all these challenges, these measures were taken: (1) We assessed the loca,on of each student, then we tried to put into perspec,ve the date of their lessons to be able to come up with an op,mal route to deliver all the devices on the right ,me. (2) We managed to find a solu,on to this problem by coordina,ng and coopera,ng with MicrosoV. (3) We provided the right training to our teachers and school administra,ons to be able to manage the interac,on with the remote support specialist to ease the process and make it more efficient.

"Multiculturalism ""A model of integration policies that welcomes the preservation, expression and sometimes even the celebration of cultural diversity. This approach encourages migrants to become full members of society while retaining their cultural identities.

Agrarian economies Conflict-affected countries Urbanizing countries Resource-rich countries Small island nations Countries with high youth unemployment Formalizing countries Aging societies Jobs challenge Which countries and which policies?	Trade agreements are a potential instrument for international coordination on rights. They can incorporate incentives for attention to voice and working conditions by linking trade access to the adoption and enforcement of labor laws and standards. Whether linking rights to trade actually leads to better outcomes for workers on either side of a trade agreement is less clear. Labor clauses can be used as a protectionist tool, undermining trade and employment opportunities in developing countries. Moreover, in the absence of capacity and institutions to monitor and enforce compliance, trade agreements on their own can be weak instruments.

Good quality physical infrastructure is critical for the sound functioning of an economy--it DOING BUSINESS 202052 plays a central role in determining the location of economic activity.	Businesses care about what they get in return for their taxes. Good quality physical infrastructure is critical for the sound functioning of an economy--it DOING BUSINESS 202052 plays a central role in determining the location of economic activity. The efficiency with which tax revenue is converted into public goods and services has an impact on the tax morale of businesses and individuals. Data show that, in economies where fewer tax payments result from the use of e-filing and e-payment of taxes, the public's perception of the quality of public services--and their independence from political pressure--is higher.22 Electronic services facilitate a transparent platform for collaboration among government agencies as well as interactions with taxpayers, reducing the vulnerability of public services to political interference.	n

Important challenges remain, but Vietnam is The Republic of Korea effectively used policies to bring out the agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by 2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.	n

Sustainability doesn't simply mean robust ecosystems, it ensures a long-term revenue stream for pioneer investors, those with the foresight to plan and make changes now to prepare for future resource constraints.	In a new era of resource constraints, new tools are needed for securing economic success and resilience. The good news is that with Ecological Footprint accounting, we now can track something we did not see before--the extent to which we are overdrawing our ecological accounts, and how far we are away from rebalancing this budget. This information provides a hopeful perspective, suggesting that even working with what we have now, it is well within our ability to secure long-term well-being for all of society. In addition, future-proofing our economies and refocusing our investment efforts can have tremendous payback. Sustainability doesn't simply mean robust ecosystems, it ensures a long-term revenue stream for pioneer investors, those with the foresight to plan and make changes now to prepare for future resource constraints. In fact, if we reverse population trends, improve resource efficiency measures, sufficiently reduce consumption and better manage our ecological assets to increase yields, then demand will no longer exceed supply. If we end overshoot, resource constraints by definition disappear.	n

Singapore and Hong Kong (China) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region.	Obviously, a country does not need to be self-sufficient in domestic food production to achieve or sustain food security. Singapore and Hong Kong (China) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region. Malaysia meets almost one-quarter of its rice needs through imports. It is a prudent policy because Malaysia maintains domestic production with subsidies; resources tied up in rice cultivation can be used more productively in alternative economic activities. What is important for food security is achieving food self-reliance. This requires (1) a favorable export growth at the national level, permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost; and (2) at the household level, developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food. Most countries in East and Rice around the world 67 Southeast Asia are fortunate in this respect. With growing economic prosperity and alleviation of poverty, they are able to fulfill these conditions. In fact, as the cost of rice production increases with growing wage rates, land prices, and scarcity of water, it makes sense to readjust resources away from labor-intensive rice cultivation, if improving economic efficiency is the primary consideration.	n

Women are underrepresented in the workforce and management of environment-related institutions, as illustrated by a 2013 global survey101 of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) of member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).	As shown in Chapter 5 on Power and decisionmaking, women still hold a minority of decisionmaking positions in most public and private institutions. This is also the case when it comes to environment-related institutions. Women are underrepresented in the workforce and management of environment-related institutions, as illustrated by a 2013 global survey101 of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) of member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Globally in 2013, women represented 33percent of the global workforce and 19percent of the senior management in NMHS. Gender parity was far from being achieved even among new staff. Women represented 39percent of the NMHS staff recruited in 2012.102 This was the result of a small pool of women interested and educated in meteorological and hydrological services, as well as policies and practices in staff recruitment that perpetuate gender imbalances in the workforce and management. As at 2013, only 41percent of WMO members had implemented an action plan for gender mainstreaming in the NMHS, and 48percent had human resources policies that promoted gender equality and the empowerment of women.	n
Globalization is leading to a growing international migration of jobs not only in manufacturing but also, increasingly, in services.	Migration of workers Precise figures on the global number of international migrants are not available, an unsurprising fact given that a number of them cross borders illegally or do not return once their visas and permits expire. That is why estimates tend to rely on population censuses and household surveys. Even then, differences across countries in the way that data are gathered, and in the way legislation defines nationality and migratory status, make accurate counts difficult.1 The orders of magnitude are relatively uncontroversial, however. There are more than 200 million migrants worldwide, and 90 million of them are Connected jobs agendas The migration of people matches opportunities across borders. Globalization is leading to a growing international migration of jobs not only in manufacturing but also, increasingly, in services.	n

Preliminary results from studies with humans show no adverse physiological effects in blood and urine tests and the digestive tract. Hence, these studies show promise that use of HSCAS clay to reduce the negative effects of aflatoxins in peanut foods will be a major technology breakthrough in studies planned at the Ghana institutions.	n
One of many areas of particular U.S. concern involves medications.	"Although rights holders report enforcement efforts by Chinese government authorities, and high-level officials continue to express their steadfast commitment to curtailing IPR infringement, counterfeiting in China remains widespread and affects a wide range of goods. One of many areas of particular U.S. concern involves medications. Despite years of sustained engagement by the United States, China still needs to improve its regulation of the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients to prevent their use in counterfeit and substandard medications, as well as to prevent the manufacture and distribution of ""placebo"" substances that purport to contain active ingredients but do not. In October 2017, China published limited draft revisions to the Drug Administration Law and stated that future proposed revisions to the remainder of this law would be forthcoming. Although many elements of the October 2017 draft revisions appear to be positive, the United States remains in close contact with the U.S. pharmaceutical industry and will continue to monitor developments in this area."	n

The FSI is designed to encourage the development of high-growth and high value-added financial activities in Singapore.	Tax incentives, exemptions and reductions. Singapore offers a wide range of tax incentives that are generally granted on an approval basis to promote investments in selected industry sectors, including the following: * Pioneer companies and pioneer service companies. A pioneer enterprise is exempt from income tax on its qualifying profits for up to 15 years. * Development and expansion incentive (dei). DEI companies enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 5% or 10% on their incremental income derived from the performance of qualifying activities. * Approved royalties, technical assistance fees and contributions to research and development (R&D) costs. * Investment allowances. * R&D incentives. An additional 150% tax deduction (effective from the 2019 year of assessment to the 2025 year of assessment) is allowed for certain qualifying R&D expenditure. * Intellectual Property (IP) development incentive. A new IP regime, the IP Development Incentive, is effective from 1 July 2018 to 31 December 2023. This incentive incorporates the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)-compliant modified nexus approach. * Finance and treasury center incentive. Income derived from the provision of qualifying services to approved network companies and from the carrying on of qualifying activities on own account is subject to tax at a rate of 8%. * Financial sector incentive (FSI). The FSI is designed to encourage the development of high-growth and high value-added financial activities in Singapore. A 5%, 10%, 12% or 13.5% concessionary tax rate applies to income derived from carrying on qualifying activities by approved FSI companies in Singapore. * Maritime sector incentives. Ship operators, maritime lessors and providers of certain supporting shipping services may enjoy tax incentives under the Maritime Sector Incentive, which consists of the following three broad categories: --International shipping enterprise --Maritime (ship or container) leasing --Supporting shipping services * Global Trader Programme (GTP). Under the GTP, approved companies enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 5% or 10% on qualifying transactions conducted in prescribed commodities and products.	n
This requires (1) a favorable export growth at the national level, permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost; and (2) at the household level, developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food.	Obviously, a country does not need to be self-sufficient in domestic food production to achieve or sustain food security. Singapore and Hong Kong (China) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region. Malaysia meets almost one-quarter of its rice needs through imports. It is a prudent policy because Malaysia maintains domestic production with subsidies; resources tied up in rice cultivation can be used more productively in alternative economic activities. What is important for food security is achieving food self-reliance. This requires (1) a favorable export growth at the national level, permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost; and (2) at the household level, developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food. Most countries in East and Rice around the world 67 Southeast Asia are fortunate in this respect. With growing economic prosperity and alleviation of poverty, they are able to fulfill these conditions. In fact, as the cost of rice production increases with growing wage rates, land prices, and scarcity of water, it makes sense to readjust resources away from labor-intensive rice cultivation, if improving economic efficiency is the primary consideration.	n
Government regulations covering transportation and labeling/packaging vary among F2F countries, and their ability to enforce these regulations also varies.	"Government regulations covering transportation and labeling/packaging vary among F2F countries, and their ability to enforce these regulations also varies. F2F volunteers should be aware that pesticides are often sold after being repackaged, and may not have labels; may have ""forged"" labels, and may actually be obsolete products or adulterated. It is unlikely that F2F volunteers will be able to rely on intact labeling, and should be prepared to provide advice in place of label directions. For example, the Bangladesh IP stated that there are around 250 pesticide companies in Bangladesh; most of them import concentrated chemicals mainly from China, India, and Germany, then dilute them in approved mixing ratio. Afterward, they pack and label them for marketing."	n
In it, he took the concept of agglomeration a step further, arguing that people are drawn not only to the opportunities that cities offer, but also to amenities such as theaters, museums, and restaurants.	"Glaeser is similarly skeptical of historic preservation rules, to the dismay of followers of Jane Jacobs, the legendary critic of urban-renewal projects who celebrated the lively street life of New York's old ethnic neighborhoods. Glaeser is a big Jacobs fan--he owns an autographed copy of her 1961 classic, The Death and Life of Great American Cities--but argues that her efforts to oppose development in Greenwich Village were at odds with her support for low-income housing. ""I believe that many of our oldest buildings are treasures,"" he says. ""But don't simultaneously pretend that that's a route toward affordability. Affordability is created by mass-produced cheap housing or mass-produced cheap commercial space. And you might not like it aesthetically, but that is the affordable route."" In 2000, Glaeser published ""Consumer City,"" a paper he wrote with Jed Kolko and Albert Saiz.

Extrusion was used to produce high quality texturized meat substitute from fermented and unfermented peanut flour.	Project NCA32U - 294 - (1) Peanut-based meat analogs were highly acceptable as ground beef substitutes in three Hispanic snacks (taquitos, tamales, and chili). These meat analogs are also potential candidates for incorporation into other meat-based formulations. Extrusion was used to produce high quality texturized meat substitute from fermented and unfermented peanut flour. (2) High consumer acceptance of peanut-based fish nuggets incorporating up to 15% defat peanut flour. Addition of peanut flour masked the muddy taste of catfish and fishy taste of tilapia. Consumers' test showed that the product has potential for commercialization. The sensory characteristics of the best fish nuggets were further optimized via enhanced formulation and optimized extrusion technologies. Overall, the extrusion process produced a better texture, improved flavor product compared to the non-extruded fish nuggets.	n
Examples include public hospitals, public medical colleges, prisons and detention centres, military facilities and public health insurance organizations.	"BOX 4.2 Trends in the contribution of PPM approaches to TB case notifications ""Public-public"" mix refers to engagement by a country's NTP with public health sector providers of TB care that are not under the direct purview of the NTP. Examples include public hospitals, public medical colleges, prisons and detention centres, military facilities and public health insurance organizations. ""Public-private"" mix refers to engagement by the NTP with private sector providers of TB care. Examples include private individual and institutional providers, the corporate or business sector, mission hospitals, nongovernmental organizations and faith-based organizations. Engaging with all health providers through PPM approaches is essential to achieve universal access to TB prevention and care services. Other benefits include easing the heavy workload of NTPs and accelerating the introduction of new technologies. Trends in the contribution of PPM to notifications in selected countries where PPM has been recognized as a priority, and data for countries that have reported to WHO each year during 2012-2018, are shown in Fig. B4.2.1 (public-public mix) and Fig. B4.2.2 (public-private mix). Countries that have prioritized public non-NTP sector engagement, clearly shown by increasing trends in the contribution of this sector to TB case notifications, are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. Prioritization of private sector engagement is visible from trends in notifications in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Philippines. National TB inventory studies that quantify the underreporting of detected TB cases in both public and private sectors can help to identify the types of PPM approaches that should be prioritized, since they identify the type of providers that are diagnosing and treating a large proportion of the total number of detected TB cases."	n

Given the need to stabilize the rainfed upland environment and the success of the NERICAs, WARDA implements its research strategy for this environment along the following four lines: * Increased use of NERICA seed in farmers' fields. PVS work in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire has shown the potential of NERICAs in farmers' fields. In the coming decade, WARDA will expand the number of farmers exposed to NERICAs throughout the region through PVS. * The development of new inter-and intraspecific rice cultivars. WARDA will enlarge the gene pool for uplands using advanced and more traditional breeding tools. In addition, participatory plant breeding will provide farmer input into WARDA's breeding program and speed up the identification of favorable plant material with resistance to drought and soil acidity. * Validation and dissemination of integrated natural resource management (INRM) practices. INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and/or sustainable intensification. Building on previous achievements in the development of N-fixing fallow legumes and the introduction of a modest use of fertilizer, including rock-phosphate, emphasis will be placed on integrated biophysical and socioeconomic assessment of these technologies and the formulation of adequate baskets of technologies. * Creating an enabling environment for the scaling-up of NERICAs and INRM practices. For the varietal component, a focus will be placed on community-based seed supply systems to address weak seed multiplication systems for farmers of rainfed rice. For INRM, the focus will be on strengthening the capabilities of rice development stakeholders in applying research results.	n

Civil society actors, especially those critically monitor and politically mobilise for the rights of migrants in Europe, have faced prosecutions and criminal convictions when assisting this population.	Many IJMBS articles examined the shifting conception of borders as tools of governance and as boundaries of belonging. A perfect illustration is the 'anticipatory interdiction' measures implemented by Canada to manage the geopolitical 'threat' posed by asylum claimants from Mexico. Measures such as the United StatesCanada Safe Third Country Agreement, the Mexican visa imposition, and the safe country of origin scheme formed a virtual border to effectively filter and exclude migrants from Mexico. In a similar vein, the EU border control regime generated exclusion and precarity of migrants during the so-called 'European refugee crisis' in 2015. As an IJMBS contribution put it, when over a million people reached Europe, intense political debate on the 'crisis' has prevented public opinion from seeing how its root causes lie in the intrinsic weaknesses of the solidarity and responsibility sharing mechanisms in the EU. Indeed another article argued that the EU's political priority to counter migrant smuggling affected the provision of humanitarian assistance and access to rights for irregular immigrants and asylum seekers. Civil society actors, especially those critically monitor and politically mobilise for the rights of migrants in Europe, have faced prosecutions and criminal convictions when assisting this population. Authors pointed almost invariably to the pressing issue of ensuring transparency and accountability at the border.	n

But just as important as the technical factors of production are several other considerations.	Peanut production has increased three fold over the recent production seasons and stands to increase even further due to use of soil amendments, better cultivation practices and improved varieties. These technical factors would be spurred on by the peanut CRSP. But just as important as the technical factors of production are several other considerations. There exists an unusual level of enthusiasm and willingness to participate on the part of the local farmers. There exists a high degree of trust between the project participants and the people of the Rupununi and a mutual, yet cautious expectation for success.

Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy.	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.	n

"Similar considerations apply to the evidence supporting a ""rural pipeline"" approach, with health education institutions established preferentially in rural areas and opportunities for practical training in rural areas (91)."	"The systematic review of reviews found that CHW training should include a mix of approaches (knowledge and skills based) (17, 86, 87). 7.4.4 Interpretation of the evidence and other considerations by the GDG The broader literature on effective training approaches published in other sectors points to one-off theory and discussion-based trainings as being only moderately helpful in increasing the knowledge of practitioners, and they are generally ineffective in practical skill building that is of measurable benefit in real-world practice settings (88). Substantial changes in practice behaviour could first be observed when on-the-job coaching and continuous feedback was used to support practitioners. This broader literature may be of value when considering the development of practice guidelines for CHWs in this area (89, 90). The GDG considered that the evidence base from other health occupational groups - showing that a balance between theoretical and practical training is associated with positive outcomes - can be assumed to apply also to CHWs. Similar considerations apply to the evidence supporting a ""rural pipeline"" approach, with health education institutions established preferentially in rural areas and opportunities for practical training in rural areas (91). Efforts should also be made to ensure that digital health education approaches complement, rather that replace, traditional face-to-face instructional modalities (92). 7.4.5 Implementation considerations Countries will need to identify the appropriate balance in their context between theoretical and practical training, taking into account a variety of factors, including the pre-existing literacy and educational attainment of trainees. The use of dynamic teaching methodologies, as well as the use of multimedia resources, have the potential to make the training more attractive and effective. The role of simulated practice may be considered for skills development and in areas where exposure to practical training in communities or health facilities may present logistical or operational challenges."	n

Today, more than one-tenth of 15-to-24-year-olds worldwide are functionally illiterate, and that does not bode well for their future.107 Also, social skills assume an ever more important role as complements to basic cognitive skills.	But jobs may neither pull nor build skills to a significant degree, even if the foundational cognitive skills are in place. This occurs in situations where the benefits from agglomeration and global integration are present but not adequately exploited. Countries undergoing rapid urbanization often have sizable knowledge spillovers to reap but may fail to move up the value-added ladder. If so, they can be caught in traps of low productivity and low skills.110 Such traps arise when skills are insufficient to spur innovation and the demand for skills is too low to encourage their acquisition. In those cases, more relevant schooling and skill building at the secondary, technical, and likely higher levels are needed as a prerequisite for the creation of good jobs for development. tation and can have cascading ripple effects.104 In Singapore, India's Tata group was the first international company to partner with the Economic Development Board in 1972 to establish a company-owned training center for precision engineers. This partnership model was successfully replicated in subsequent years with other foreign companies, eventually leading to the consolidation of various institutions in 1993 to form Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic. Today, the polytechnic has become a source of international expertise on industry-led training.105 Intel's decision to establish its semiconductor assembly and test plant in Costa Rica has equally contributed significantly to that country's prospects and skill building system.106 Jobs need skills, pull skills, and build skills Some skills are necessary for productive employment to emerge in the first place. And they cannot be acquired on the job. Without numeracy and literacy skills, the prospects of improving employment opportunities and earnings, whether in agriculture or in urban settings, are thin. Today, more than one-tenth of 15-to-24-year-olds worldwide are functionally illiterate, and that does not bode well for their future.107 Also, social skills assume an ever more important role as complements to basic cognitive skills. Given that skill building is cumulative, securing the foundation on which much of the later path of skill acquisition follows remains an absolute priority. Many countries are not there yet.	n
Jobs agendas are also connected through the international migration of jobs.	Jobs agendas are also connected through the international migration of jobs. The splintering of production tasks has facilitated their delocalization and outsourcing to developing countries, resulting in greater trade volumes and lower prices of final goods. But it has also led to a global redistribution of jobs in manufacturing, and the same trend is increasingly visible in services as well. So far, the migration of jobs out of industrial countries has mainly affected blue-collar workers, but white-collar jobs are following. These are not once-and-for-all moves. Growing labor costs in Asia may open up opportunities for other developing countries to jump-start industrialization.	n

In many societies, the family lineage is carried on by male children.	"In many societies, the family lineage is carried on by male children. The preservation of the family name is guaranteed through the son(s). Except in a few countries (e.g. Ethiopia), a girl takes her husband's family name, dropping that of her own parents. The fear of losing a name prompts families to wish to have a son. Some men marry a second or a third wife to be sure of having a male child. Among many communities in Asia and Africa, sons perform burial rites for parents. Parents with no male child do not expect to have an appropriate burial to ""secure their peace in the next world"". In almost all religions, ceremonies are performed by men. Priests, pastors, sheikhs and other religious leaders are men of great status to whom society attaches great importance, and this important role for men obliges parents to wish for a male child. Religious leaders have a major involvement in the perpetuation of son preference."	n

Gender roles and norms can also play a role in the aftermath of disasters.	The impact of extreme climate events and disasters also has a gender dimension. Although limited, available data suggest that age and sex are significant factors in mortality resulting from natural disasters. Their contribution varies by country and by type of hazard. For instance, a higher risk of death among women than men was noted mainly in the context of recent tsunamis and heatwaves. Gender roles and norms can also play a role in the aftermath of disasters. In some The World's Women 2015xiv post-disaster settings, women's access to work and their involvement in decision-making related to recovery efforts and risk-reduction strategies remain more limited than men's.	n

C Hlpe (high level panel of experts on food security and nutrition), 2012.	Using the FIES at the individual level can capture disparities in food security between women and men, including those due to intra-household differences in resource allocation and feeding priorities. Preliminary results from 117 countriesk show that women are more likely to be food insecure than men in 26 per cent of countries, and men in 12 per cent of countries. In the remaining countries, women are as likely as men to be food insecure. The association between food insecurity and gender is more prevalent in developing countries. The proportion of developing countries where women are more likely than men to be food insecure increases to 39 per cent, while for men, it remains at about the same level, at 13 per cent. However, at the completion of data collection exercises in the countries implementing the scale, further analysis is needed to confirm the validity of a global experience-based insecurity scale and ensure cross-country comparability of results, including from a gender perspective. a A first draft of this box was prepared by the FAO Statistics Division.

The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns.	Across survey years and labor input variables (family and hired), rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective. Cotton and cashew producers make the most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Finally, consistent with findings from other countries (for example, Damiani (2003) for Brazil), vegetable production is also highly labor intensive. Its potential has so far been largely left unexploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but much scope for improvement remains.	n
The second identifies the social, economic, and institutional factors that create feedbacks reproducing this differential response capacity (Bahadur et al. 2013, Bene et al. 2016a).	"In order to implement agricultural development policy in deltas that builds farmer resilience, we first need to be able to assess the conditions that create resilience. Increasingly, it is recognized that resilience assessments have two essential components. The first identifies the characteristics of farmers that explain heterogeneous responses to shocks (Carter et al. 2007, Hoddinott and Quisumbing 2010). The second identifies the social, economic, and institutional factors that create feedbacks reproducing this differential response capacity (Bahadur et al. 2013, Bene et al. 2016a). The first of these assessment components identifies ""proximal"" factors that affect or predict the resilience of rice farmers to climate hazards. Knowledge of these proximal factors is important for targeting within agricultural development policy ensuring the resilience of vulnerable groups of farmers is bolstered."	n

We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional, social, cultural, and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming.	Rice farmer resilience: contextual drivers The results presented above illustrate that the majority of rice farmers have limited resilience to climate hazards; they persist in Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ a livelihood system typified by low-productivity rice cropping and ineffective coping strategies. These livelihoods are susceptible to losses from climate hazards and do not generate resources that farmers can utilize in response to climate impacts. This is a partial explanation as to why rice farmers lack resilience; it does not answer what led to this state occurring nor fully explain why it persists. To understand why such a state persists it is necessary to identify the underlying contextual drivers of this situation. We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional, social, cultural, and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming. Our research suggested that these underlying contextual drivers were (i) the institutions surrounding land ownership, (ii) the nature of formal institutional support, (iii) lack of employment diversity, and (iv) expenses related to cultural activities.	n

The survey provides nationally representative data on approximately 12,000 households and their members. It includes a household-based module on Income Generating Activities and Household Enterprises. From this survey, we are able to perform analysis at the level of the unit of production as well as at the level of the household enterprise owner (often household heads). Key information on difficulties at entry, sector, and location of operation, number of workers, levels of profits or revenues are derived from this module.	n

Technical secondary education is offered in the lower and upper secondary cycle at middle schools in such subjects as Commerce, Applied Arts, Teacher Training, Agriculture and Civil Aviation.	Country Notes Primary education lasts for six years and is compulsory. However the draft Constitution recommends that there be nine years of compulsory education. Admission to secondary education is, at present, based on an intra-school examination not a national Baccaluria. Secondary education covers six years divided into two three-year cycles: grades 7 to 9 in middle school (Maktabeh Motevaseteh) and grades 10 to 12 at high school (Doreyeh Aali). At the end of the first cycle, pupils sit for an examination. At the end of the second cycle, they sit for intra-school examinations. Technical secondary education is offered in the lower and upper secondary cycle at middle schools in such subjects as Commerce, Applied Arts, Teacher Training, Agriculture and Civil Aviation. Courses lead to a Baccaluria equivalent level qualification. A structure of eight years of general basic education followed by four years of secondary education had been introduced for a few years during the educational reform of 1975.	n

Technical In many cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies.	Approaches: Production efficiency projects are based on scientific research approaches designed to increase production especially under conditions of low or minimized input use. In lesser-developed countries, technologies that exploit genetic resistances or avoidance mechanisms are most likely to impact on peanut production by resourcepoor farmers. These same approaches are the ones most likely to provide benefits to the U.S., where chemical inputs are a major cost and where lowering costs of production is an important requirement for the farmers to remain competitive. Increased efficiency of labor resource utilization will become a paramount issue as the ravages of the HIV epidemic impact labor resources in developing countries, and reduced use of pesticides will impact positively on environment preservation. In East/Southern Africa, collaboration with ICRISAT has guided the approach. ICRISAT has been developing varieties with early maturity and resistance to Groundnut Rosette Virus disease (GRV) and the Peanut CRSP has worked both upstream (evaluating variability) and downstream enabling the national programs to test and release adapted varieties. In this cluster a number of projects are utilizing or developing biotechnology tools to allow for improved efficiency of crop improvement (gene-probes/markers and genetic manipulation) to access and evaluate novel genes that have the potential to provide solutions to otherwise intractable problems. 2. Outputs/achievements: 2.1. Technical In many cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies. These include improved germplasm and varieties, improved production practices, new techniques and interventions, and improvement of institutional and human resource capacity. 2.1.1 Genetic Improvement Improved varieties and useful germplasm have been released, developed or identified in a number of projects (UFL 16, TAM17, UGA28, NMX53): Disease resistant varieties in experimental plots in Ghana.	n

Depending on the nature of the jobs challenges facing a country, tensions may emerge between growth that generates jobs for living standards and growth that generates jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion.	When a growth strategy may not be sufficient Focusing on the aggregate relationship between growth and employment downplays some of the most important channels through which jobs connect to development. The very notion of employment as derived labor demand does not reflect the situation of the many working people in developing countries who are farmers and self-employed. The focus on the labor market as the transmission chain between growth and employment also does not capture the interaction of working people with others in households, at the workplace, and in society more broadly. Focusing solely on the relationship between growth and employment may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender equality, support urbanization, or contribute Growth strategies or jobs strategies? 88 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 In practice, however, tradeoffs between the three transformations can amount to more than just lags and gaps. Depending on the nature of the jobs challenges facing a country, tensions may emerge between growth that generates jobs for living standards and growth that generates jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion. Examples abound: * In agrarian economies, increasing productivity in smallholder farming is fundamental for poverty reduction, given the share of the population living in rural areas. But urban jobs in activities that connect the economy to world markets and global value chains are necessary for growth. With limited resources to support both, a tradeoff between living standards and productivity may arise. * In resource-rich countries, massive investments in extractive industries support accel- to peaceful collective decision making. Understanding how to enhance these positive spillovers from jobs might be difficult when only aggregates are considered.	n

Exporting allows the most productive firms to grow.	23 percent.31 Nonetheless, not all workers benefit equally from living and working together in cities, nor do they contribute equally to productivity growth. Workers with better cognitive and social skills tend to benefit more.32 Workers also enjoy higher wages when they are surrounded by a more educated labor force.33 The association between urban scale and productivity has also been documented in many developing economies, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey.34 In Taiwan, China, a 10 percent increase in total manufacturing employment in a locality F I G U R E 5 . 7 Agglomeration effects vary across industrial sectors in Taiwan, China Source: Sonobe and Otsuka 2006b.

Global integration improves domestic resource allocation because it puts greater pressure on firms to be competitive. Exporting allows the most productive firms to grow. But in doing so, they also exert pressure on the least productive ones to contract or exit. Global integration also generates knowledge spillovers. These arise through exposure to new technologies embodied in traded goods or through new management practices in companies receiving FDI. Knowledge spillovers take place horizontally, between competitors, and vertically, through buyer-supplier relationships.	n

The multi-disciplinary team at Makerere University (Departments of Food Science and Technology, Agricultural Extension and Education, Animal Science, Gender Studies, and Medical School) and the National Agricultural Extension Services of the Ministry of Agriculture complements the multidisciplinary approach of Virginia Tech.	Research partnership with the Ecole Nationale d'Economie Appliquee (ENEA) in Senegal did not remain viable. Experience with partnering with Makerere University in Uganda was more satisfactory. The multi-disciplinary team at Makerere University (Departments of Food Science and Technology, Agricultural Extension and Education, Animal Science, Gender Studies, and Medical School) and the National Agricultural Extension Services of the Ministry of Agriculture complements the multidisciplinary approach of Virginia Tech. Collaboration with the Ugandan Bureau of Statistics resulted on the preparation of baseline database on aflatoxin exposure levels in Ugandan population. This linkage should be strengthened to ensure maintenance of the data sets and make it accessible to local and regional researchers and policy makers. In 2002, potential partnerships with an NGO (Tostan) and the Association pour la Promotion de la Femme Senegalese (APRPFES) were negotiated. APROPFES has 200 collaborating villages in the Peanut Basin region. Since these two NGOs did not continue their participation, as was also the case for an NGO Tostan, that also initially indicated willingness to participate in the project, the project was transferred from Senegal to Uganda. In Uganda, Peanut CRSP has linked with the National Association of Women in Uganda (NAWOU) and their sub-organizations. This provided access to local women's organizations to ensure their participation in the project. Women make up majority of peanut farmers and do most of the post-harvest and processing activities. Such linkages should be maintained and strengthened.	n

Members of the European Union are subject to Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding [EU Pregnant Workers Directive]. The minimum length of maternity leave required by the Directive is the same as in Convention No. 183: 14 weeks (European Economic Community, 1992, Article 8(1). All EU Member States meet the 14-week minimum. In 2013, Iceland, which provides three months of maternity leave, introduced a new Bill including a plan to expand the share of non-transferable parental leave period from three to five months for each parent with a reduction in the shared period of leave from three to two months, according to a 5+5+2 model, instead of the current 3+3+3 one (O'Brien, 2013). 4. In 1994, the ILO had data on maternity leave duration and cash benefits for 139 countries, as reported in the Conditions of work digest: Maternity and work, Vol. 13 (Geneva, ILO, 1994).	n

Gross enrolment ratios (GER)5 in pre-primary education have increased consistently in all regions of the world for both boys and girls over the same period.	Coverage of pre-primary education has steadily expanded over the period 1990 -2012 (figure 3.1). Gross enrolment ratios (GER)5 in pre-primary education have increased consistently in all regions of the world for both boys and girls over the same period. Worldwide, pre-primary enrolment rose from 28 to 54 per cent for boys while it increased from 27 to 54 per cent for girls. Overall, participation in pre-primary education was the highest in developed regions. It was also relatively high in Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania, where the regional averages were above 70 per cent for both boys and girls. Enrolment was low in Northern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Western Asia and the Caucasus and Central Asia.

The Dakar Framework for Action reinforced the previous efforts and commitments of the international community to progress toward inclusive education for all, including persons with disabilities.181 Article 24 of the CRPD (2006) stipulated that States Parties should ensure access to inclusive, quality and free primary and secondary education on an equal basis with others.	International normative frameworks on disability and education The right of persons with disabilities to education has been declared in a number of international instruments, including the World Declaration on Education for All, stemming from the World Conference on Education for All (1990), which stressed the importance of equity and equal access to basic education for all, with attention to persons with disabilities.180 The Standard Rules on Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (1993) represented the strong political commitment to equalization of educational opportunities for persons with disabilities. In 2000, the global community reaffirmed its commitment to the Education for All movement by adopting the Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting our Collective Commitments at the World Education Forum.

Rice around the world 65 for the tropics.	Rice around the world 65 for the tropics. The hybrids have a yield advantage of 15% to 20% over the currently inbred high-yielding varieties. Rice hybrids were developed in China. The increase in rice yields in China during 1975-90 was due largely to the diffusion of hybrid varieties to 50% of the rice area. The Chinese hybrids are not suitable for the tropical climates in Southeast and South Asia. IRRI scientists have developed suitable hybrid lines for the tropics and these are now being used by scientists in India and Vietnam to develop varieties for release to farmers. However, with the high cost of seeds and low prices (because of inferior grain quality), hybrid rice varieties do not have an advantage over the high-yielding varieties with regard to profitability. This will constrain the adoption of hybrid rice by farmers unless breeders are successful in developing better quality hybrids with higher heterosis. Another constraint may be that, when using hybrids, farmers need to change seeds every season, which is an unconventional practice.	n
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE Between September 2016 and January 2017, joint police and military forces carried out security operations in Dogiyai, Papua province, during the run-up to the 2017 local elections.	Human rights groups reported unlawful killings and other serious human rights violations by security forces, primarily in the context of excessive use of force during mass protests or during security operations. No perpetrators were known to have been held to account, particularly for numerous incidents in Papua. EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE Between September 2016 and January 2017, joint police and military forces carried out security operations in Dogiyai, Papua province, during the run-up to the 2017 local elections. On 10 January police officers arbitrarily arrested Otis Pekei when he refused to hand over a knife at a police checkpoint, and detained him at the Moanemani sub-district police station. Later that day, police delivered Otis Pekei's body to the home of his family; the family accused the police of torturing him during detention. No investigation was known to have been conducted. On 1 August in Deiyai, Papua province, police officers arbitrarily opened fire into a crowd of protesters without warning, wounding at least 10 people, including children. Nine police officers were subjected to disciplinary action; no criminal proceedings were known to have been opened. UNLAWFUL KILLINGS The number of killings by police of suspected drug dealers increased sharply, from 18 in 2016 to at least 98 in 2017. Some of the officers involved in the incidents were seconded to the National Narcotics Agency. Police claimed that all the killings were in self-defence or because suspects tried to flee the scene. No independent investigations were known to have been conducted into these killings. The number of deaths escalated after several high-ranking Indonesian officials, including the President, 196 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 advocated during the year for tougher measures to address drug-related crime, including calling for the application of unrestrained lethal force against suspected traffickers.	n

Lawlessness and violence increased further in the Philippines.	"Many of those taking action to demand respect for human rights and accountability for violations were demonized and criminalized, leading to shrinking civic space. Police and security forces persecuted human rights defenders. Extrajudicial killings, torture and other illtreatment, and enforced disappearances persisted with impunity. The Myanmar security forces' campaign of violence against the Rohingya people in northern Rakhine State, which amounted to crimes against humanity, created a human rights and humanitarian crisis in the country and in neighbouring Bangladesh. Lawlessness and violence increased further in the Philippines. The President's contempt for human rights in the""war on drugs"" was characterized by mass killings, mostly of people from poor and marginalized groups, including children. The scope of the killings and rampant impunity led to growing calls for an investigation at the international level. The extension of martial law in the island of Mindanao in December led to concerns that military rule could be 42 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 used to justify further human rights abuses. The government attempted to reintroduce the death penalty. In Indonesia, police killings of suspected drug dealers rose sharply. Australia continued to pay lip service to human rights while subjecting asylum-seekers and refugees to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Governments in Southeast Asia and the Pacific failed to uphold economic, social and cultural rights. Villagers in Laos were forced to relocate due to development projects; the right to adequate housing in Cambodia was undermined by land grabbing; and housing conditions for foreign workers in Singapore were criticized as poor by NGOs. National elections were held in Papua New Guinea, amid allegations of corruption and heavyhanded actions by the authorities, including violence and arbitrary arrests."	n
Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards.	On-farm and off-farm activities can be complementary in assisting households to manage risk. In other contexts off-farm income has been important in helping small-scale farmers cope with shocks in India (Gaurav 2015), Mozambique (Cunguara et al. 2011), and South America (Bebbington 1999). In Odisha, vulnerable farming communities are characterized by dependence Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ on subsistence rice farming and limited off-farm opportunities (Panda 2016). In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined. This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.	n

A project to develop a database of talented women is ongoing under the initiative of the Presidential Office as a way to evaluate and utilize the capacities and talents of women across the country.	Summary of Country Gender Profile in Cote d'Ivoire (2013) General Situation of Women  Following the end of the long political crisis in 2011, Cote d'Ivoire is making efforts toward to restoration. However, because of long turmoil of the crisis, statistical data is insufficient, and the development of statistics and a population registration system are pressing issues.  In Cote d'Ivoire, there are various ethnic groups, each with a different language, culture and customs. The social status of women varies in each ethnic group. Generally, the social and economic status of women is low, and they have inadequate access to basic social services and less economic power compared to men. Government Policy  The government of Cote d'Ivoire has adopted policies and action plans to promote gender equality. It is important to assure the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these actions.  The strategy for the fight against gender based violence (GBV) was established in 2012, and it is now in the implementation phase of the action plan.  A project to develop a database of talented women is ongoing under the initiative of the Presidential Office as a way to evaluate and utilize the capacities and talents of women across the country. National Machinery  In 1976, the Ministry for Condition of Woman (Ministere de la Condition de la Femme) was established. Since then, the ministry has been in charge of promoting gender equality. However, the budget has not been sufficiently allocated. Therefore, the allocation of an adequate budget and the establishment of administrative capacity are required.  Gender Groups have not been established in all ministries. Sufficient budget allocation and human resources are challenges for the Gender Groups.	n

In the next 15 years, half of the population in developing countries will reside in urban areas, the result of a migration that is rapidly shifting work from the farm to the factory or the street. The rural-urban shift generally improves individual well-being, especially for those who find wage employment. Still, workers' share of global income may be declining, a pattern attributed in part to globalization and technological change. Wages for the same occupation are converging across countries, but a higher premium is paid for more skilled occupations. Women's earnings still lag behind those of men, and the fraction of them who work varies enormously across countries. While women's labor force participation exceeds 75 percent in Vietnam, it is only 28 percent in Pakistan.	n

Permanent cultivation of upland rice is practiced in many Asian and Latin American countries.	Permanent cultivation of upland rice is practiced in many Asian and Latin American countries. This is characterized by orderly intercropping, relay cropping, and sequential cropping with several crops. The largest area of permanent upland rice cultivation is in eastern India. In the Chhattisgarh Plateau area of Jharkand and Bihar, rainfall will support only a single upland crop per season. Rice may be grown continuously or rotated with legumes and pasture. Rice yields in continuous production tend to be very low (around 1 t/ha) because of nematode buildup and other biotic factors that are not well understood, but yields in rotation with legumes may exceed 2 t/ha. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, upland rice is usually double-cropped with gram, mustard, or other upland crops. Because the risk of crop damage or loss resulting from drought or pests is high, and because upland rice farmers are usually poor and have limited access to credit, most apply few inputs of animal manure, organic matter, chemical fertilizer, and pesticide to upland rice crops. This is particularly true in areas where farmers 22 Rice almanac produce rice on both lowland and upland fields. In such areas, farmers invest more in their lowland fields, where greater response to inputs is usually obtained.	n

While the nation's enabling environment (22nd) is strong relative to the global average, it trails subregional competition.	Most of the subregion's nations enhanced their T&T competitiveness since the last report. Denmark is the region's most improved economy, climbing 10 places to rank 21st globally, thanks to a significant improvement on air transport infrastructure (44th to 29th) and price competitiveness, although it's still one of the world's most expensive countries (131st). Norway has Northern Europe's largest and most competitive T&T economy, but also experienced the largest decline in overall score (18th to 20th). Like much of the subregion, the country scores well in areas related to the overall enabling environment (8th), infrastructure (22nd) and prioritization of T&T (19th). However, Norway stands out for exceptional air transport infrastructure (5th), due to high airport (4th) and departure density, leading environmental sustainability (2nd) and above subregion average natural resources (51st). Nevertheless, the nation's Natural Resources pillar score dropped 21 places as recalibrated protected area data proved less favourable (100th). Natural tourism digital demand also fell (10th to 21st), as did scores related to business environment (10th to 20th) and safety and security (7th to 17th).

Now, it is typically done in rotation with pasture (two years of rice, three years of pasture) or soybean.	"Much of Brazil's upland rice is planted on the Cerrado in central Brazil. Originally, rice was grown in this area primarily to facilitate deforestation. Now, it is typically done in rotation with pasture (two years of rice, three years of pasture) or soybean. Rotation is essential because of the ""yield collapse"" that occurs with continuous cultivation of such rice. In the second year of rice cultivation, yields typically decline by about 10%, but in the third year they can fall by as much as 70%. The cause of this problem has been variously attributed to autotoxicity, soil degradation, and soil pests. Thus, crop rotation is essential for profitable farm management."	n

Given the F2F country program responses regarding limited knowledge of the human health hazards of pesticides, and the limited accessibility, use, and maintenance of protective gear, F2F volunteers should be prepared to provide sound, practical information about safeguards. In this regard, F2F volunteers should refer to Attachment B, which contains practical mitigation measures to minimize impacts to human health.	n

Technology itself is changing the way workers and firms connect, through their access to much larger, even global, marketplaces for employment. Some of these marketplaces operate through the Internet; others use mobile phone technology.41 These changes are affecting workers in developing countries and not just those in high-skilled occupations. Babajobs, for example, was launched in 2009 and is now the largest digital marketplace for blue-collar jobs in India, with more than 320,000 job listings and more than 80,000 job seekers.	n

It was designed to foster collaboration and action to address the ecological, economic, and social harm caused by invasive alien species.	The Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) emerged out of a meeting of concerned organizations and individuals in 1996. It was designed to foster collaboration and action to address the ecological, economic, and social harm caused by invasive alien species. The first phase of GISP (1997-2000) focused on building a knowledge base on the issue of invasive alien species. This phase was driven by an international consortium of experts working as volunteers. Among the significant outputs were a global strategy on invasive alien species (McNeely ET Al., 2001) and invasive Alien Species: A toolkit of best prevention and management practices (Wittenberg & cock, 2001). The second phase of GISP (2000 - present) is designed to build upon the products of Phase I and foster greater international awareness of the problems caused by IAS. In Phase II, GISP will work with nations and regions on appropriate, cooperative measures for preventing, controlling, or eradicating IAS through six working groups, organized around the following topics: 1. National and regional facilitation and cooperation 2. Communication, education and outreach 3. Global information management 4. Pathway Management 5. Evaluation and assessment 6. Law and policy Phase II operates through an Executive Board, Advisory Panel of IAS experts, a formal Secretariat with paid staff (based in South Africa), and partnerships among countries and international organizations. GISP is prepared to play a pivotal role in building the global capacity to implement the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity26 as they relate to IAS.	n

Ensure that facilities are physically accessible and legal documents are available in an accessible format. Provision of basic legal services and legal support should accommodate the specific needs of citizens with disabilities. Countries can use opportunities like the construction or renovation of court buildings to improve accessibility as it is usually less costly than to undertake renovations only for accessibility. Accessibility of legal premises and documents should be addressed in a systemic way through national guidelines. 2) Empower persons with disabilities to exercise their legal rights and access justice. Training should be offered to persons with disabilities on legal information and their legal rights to enhance their ability to exercise their rights. All training should be provided in accessible formats. 3) Raise awareness of disability and offer disability training among legal service providers and legal officers on the specific needs of persons with disabilities and how to strengthen the quality of legal services for persons with disabilities.

The education system comprises of 3 stages, namely primary, secondary and tertiary education, with the rural poor falling away as years passed. The intention is that children enter the former at age 7, and remain there for 6 years, while they learn the basics of the same subjects that children learn everywhere. The secondary school model is a 2-tier one. After the first 4 of 7 years, examinations are held for the certificate of the lower cycle of secondary study, or brevet d'etude du premier cycle. With this in hand, students could go out to work, move on to a college or lycee, or enter a teacher-training institution. Those who remain on at secondary school for the balance of the period are entitled to apply to study at a university, if either of such exist.

Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.	n

Sector of employment sector varies by gender as well as by education.	Sector of employment sector varies by gender as well as by education. Employment in agriculture is more prevalent among males, while nonagricultural self-employment is more prevalent among females (Figures 6.14a and 6.14b). With no education there is high proportion of males and females in agriculture (69 percent and 60 percent, respectively). However, as education levels increase, females are more likely to be engaged in nonagricultural self-employment than men, who instead stay in agriculture or access wage employment. There are more males in wage employment at each education level, indicating that this sector is harder for females to enter. This could be due to personal preferences or constraints, such as difficulties in balancing childcare with fixed hours wage work or a desire for the flexibility self-employment enables, or due to the unwillingness of employers to hire females.	n

The exporter arranges with the freight forwarder to deliver the goods to the appropriate port or airport.	A Typical Letter of Credit Transaction Here are the typical steps in issuing an irrevocable letter of credit that has been confirmed by a U.S. bank: 1. After the exporter and the buyer have agreed on the terms of a sale, the buyer arranges for its bank to open a letter of credit that specifies the documents needed for payment. The buyer determines which documents will be required. 2. The buyer's bank issues (opens) its irrevocable letter of credit and includes all instructions to the seller relating to the shipment. 3. The buyer's bank sends its irrevocable letter of credit to a U.S. bank and requests confirmation. The exporter may request that a particular U.S. bank be the confirming bank, or the foreign bank may select a U.S. correspondent bank. 4. The U.S. bank prepares a letter of confirmation to forward to the exporter, along with the irrevocable letter of credit. 5. The exporter carefully reviews all conditions in the letter of credit. The exporter's freight forwarder is contacted to make sure that the shipping date can be met. If the exporter cannot comply with one or more of the conditions, the customer is alerted at once because an amendment may be necessary. 6. The exporter arranges with the freight forwarder to deliver the goods to the appropriate port or airport. 7. When the goods are loaded aboard the exporting carrier, the freight forwarder completes the necessary documentation. 8. The exporter (or the freight forwarder) presents the documents, evidencing full compliance with the letter of credit terms, to the U.S. bank. 9. The bank reviews the documents. If they are in order, the documents are sent to the buyer's bank for review and then transmitted to the buyer. 10. The buyer (or the buyer's agent) uses the documents to claim the goods. 11. A sight or time draft accompanies the letter of credit. A sight draft is paid on presentation; a time draft is paid within a specified time period.	n

What can the Footprint tell managers?	The accountant in a firm is not normally the manager. What can the Footprint tell managers? The goal of Footprint accounts is to provide robust and credible information. It does not tell people what to do - it merely provides context and shows the link between choices and consequences. Then the managers can decide what is in their best interest. But it shows: How large is the Footprint - the demand for biocapacity - in Germany? This exposes where there are risks and where we might want to invest. We also want to know how much biocapacity the country has. How much does the world have? What are the trends? Our message to policy makers is that we want their country to succeed. What do these trends mean for keeping Germany competitive? What do they mean for domestic policy, for international policy, for quality of life viewed in the long term? Which cities need to be more resource efficient in order to be able to operate in the future? Countries with a growing ecological deficit are becoming more and more vulnerable. For them it is increasingly expensive and risky to maintain their resource throughput.	n

Ongoing health epidemics add to the complexity and gravity of the situation.	DRC is home to the largest IDP population in Africa with 5.01 million displaced people, including more than 940,000 people displaced in 2019. DRC also hosts some 517,000 refugees from neighbouring countries. Almost 16 million people face severe acute food insecurity, and some 3.8 million children under age 5 are acutely malnourished. This is the second-highest number of acutely food-insecure people worldwide. Ongoing health epidemics add to the complexity and gravity of the situation. The Ebola virus disease outbreak that began in Equateur Province in May 2018 is the largest recorded outbreak in Congolese history, and globally, the second largest in the world. As of the end of October 2019, 2,172 people have died from Ebola. DRC is also experiencing its worst measles epidemic, with more than 209,000 cases recorded between January and October 2019, and 4,189 deaths. Outbreaks of cholera also remain a major concern.	n

In such countries as Australia, France and Singapore, teachers are prohibited from providing such paid tutoring to the children for whom they already have responsibility in the mainstream. However, in such countries as India, Lebanon, Nigeria and Bangladesh it is common for mainstream teachers to provide supplementary tutoring for their own mainstream pupils (Bray, 2006, p.519).

This program thereby focuses on problems that cut across ecosystems, particularly with respect to policy research and scaling-up technology dissemination.	Implementing WARDA's research strategy comprises four essential elements: * Technology generation for sustainable development * Technology dissemination and farmer empowerment * Policy research * Capacity building and training of key agents of change WARDA's rainfed and irrigated area programs result in improved technologies for the respective environments. These programs address technology generation and dissemination, from upstream strategic research targeting specific constraints to the application and integration of different technology components in farmers' fields. WARDA's Rice Policy and Development Program addresses the overall environment in which the proposed technology will be disseminated and used, from the farm level up, including higher aggregation levels such as watersheds, markets, agroecological zones, nations, and regions. This program thereby focuses on problems that cut across ecosystems, particularly with respect to policy research and scaling-up technology dissemination. The fourth principal element, capacity building and training, is not specifically linked to any particular program. Instead, it is integrated into each program under the coordination of a training unit.	n

Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted, albeit somewhat passively, to resume their livelihoods.	Remarkably few evaluations have been done of the recovery period, so it is not possible to make a definitive judgment on the effectiveness and impact of the recovery processes after the 2000 floods. However, Mozambique's recovery from the 2000 floods broadly appears to have been effective and generally well handled. The 2000 floods in Mozambique demonstrated clearly that it is possible to make an impact and carry out extensive recovery activities when the disaster is high profile and the amount of money donated to the affected populations is large. Recovery programs provided an opportunity for investments in upgraded services and infrastructure. Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted, albeit somewhat passively, to resume their livelihoods. On the negative side, asset depletion has been neglected in the post-emergency period. Increased social capital was the most important positive aspect for affected populations. There are indications that some of the new social structures created - associations, community committees and resettlement areas - will strengthen the safety net for future disasters, but it is too early to state categorically that this will be a lasting effect of the post-emergency interventions. Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important, long-term achievement of the recovery interventions. The importance of infrastructure construction and rehabilitation should not be underestimated when preparing contingency plans and developing a set of interventions to be considered post-emergency. In terms of Mozambique's development of its disaster preparedness and mitigation plan, much will depend on the level of commitment given to it by the government and by donors. The importance of this area is shown when a devastating disaster (of the kind experienced in 2000) occurs, but institutional memories can be short and other priorities may dominate, particularly in economic and political areas. It is also a question of whether disaster management issues can be maintained as priorities when government budgets are likely to be under increasing pressure. xiii .	n

While more years of education is usually positive, without increases in learning outcomes, the results can become meaningless. As highlighted in Chapter5, labor productivity is key to ensure labor costs are competitive and for the continued expansion of formal enterprises. In this respect, results from resent PASEC data on the skills of children throughout the education system are concerning. PASEC data from 2009 and 2014 suggest that the quality of education in Coted'Ivoire, measured in terms of test scores in French and Math, is below that of other Francophone African countries. These results point to strong skills gaps among children, which can have long-lasting consequences and limit the competitiveness of the future workforce.	n

Each of these activities is conducted at key sites selected as being representative of broader domains in West and Central Africa.	n
In Sierra Leone, the government has redeployed hospital staff and CHWs to be trained in case management and contact tracing.	In Sierra Leone, the government has redeployed hospital staff and CHWs to be trained in case management and contact tracing. Health system resources were already strained, so this reassignment of staff is likely to significantly reduce the availability of non-COVID-19 services. In early March, even before the first case was confirmed in the country, the EOC registered reduced patient attendance at routine services. Similar effects were seen during the Ebola outbreak in 2013 to 2016, with disastrous effects on maternal and neonatal health (Sochas et al., 2017), as well as malaria, TB, and HIV treatment (Parpla et al., 2016). Similar effects on non-maternity reproductive health services have been examined earlier; routine childhood immunisation is also expected to fall due to lack of remaining staff and resources, compounded by international supply bottlenecks. As well as staff shortages, use of services may have been reduced by patient fear of acquiring COVID-19 and by health staff reducing patient attendance in an attempt to decongest facilities. The EOC has sought to reassure the public of the safety of routine services.	n

The following two subsections examine these labor supply and demand side considerations within the context of Coted'Ivoire.	The following two subsections examine these labor supply and demand side considerations within the context of Coted'Ivoire. The working hypothesis is that, in general, as countries accelerate their develop, and in Coted'Ivoire today in particular, there is still a lot of scope for increasing earnings of the poor within agriculture. Increasing labor productivity in agriculture is also needed to help facilitate the labor movement out of agriculture (see section 2.2), which will in turn become more important as agricultural labor productivity increases and Engel's Law becomes more binding. This is not to say that facilitating labor movement out of agriculture is not part of the process, but rather to emphasize that lots of unexploited inclusive jobs potential remains in agriculture, which should be realized, also to facilitate the agricultural labor exit itself.	n

Before developing this research, we reached out to key experts in the field to help shape the guiding questions for the research and to inform our analysis. These key experts came from local women's organizations, LNHAs, foundations, and international actors such as INGOs and UN agencies. Based on their feedback, we developed the four research questions. We started the literature review by looking at academic and gray literature exploring the link between women's leadership and locally led humanitarian action, but we extended it to humanitarian action in general because the initial area of research did not result in many reports and articles. The case studies were conducted using qualitative methods in partnership with women's organizations from the two countries.3 Researchers carried out semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) for the case studies. Most of the interviews and FGDs were conducted from January to March 2019. The research partners mapped the different local and national actors involved in humanitarian action, with a focus on women leaders and women's organizations. The interviews and FGDs were held with a sample of groups that included members of local humanitarian organizations, as well as women leaders, gender experts, and women's organizations at the national and local governmental and nongovernmental levels.	n

A valuable linkage with the Philippine and Thailand projects could be made to introduce the Industry Incubator concept to transfer food processing technologies from research to the processor.	Strength: Rate of progress on the achievement of the project objectives has been very satisfactory and can be attributed to a broad-based and very experienced U.S. and ANAPO teams, which should ensure maximum success. Technology transfer through the program has resulted in production above present consumption, which may cause glut in the market. Purchase by the Japanese company has adsorbed some of the over production. In order for farmers to continue to expand production and reap the economic benefits, research in food technology needs to be implemented to develop an expanded choice of peanut products to expand domestic consumption. Peanut soup and roasted peanuts are the primary uses at present with a peanut beverage served in restaurants. A valuable linkage with the Philippine and Thailand projects could be made to introduce the Industry Incubator concept to transfer food processing technologies from research to the processor. Peanut CRSP has strong food technology projects and the U.S. Project Investigators can provide the technical expertise to Bolivia for this purpose.	n

For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration.	Health worker migration in response to the global shortage of health professionals demands dedicated and effective management, including building the capacity of health systems in origin countries, promotion of good practices and prevention of negative effects of health worker migration. There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.	n
In the UK, the Angel CoFund invests amounts of GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million into SMEs with high growth potential, working in partnership with syndicates of experienced BAs.	Policies 405. Angel investing is increasingly encouraged and supported by policy makers in many countries, as a way to mobilize financial resources and entrepreneurial expertise towards dynamic new ventures. In most cases, supply-side measures have been introduced, which mainly take the form of tax incentives and public co-investment. Given the local dimension of angel investing, in some countries, such as the US and Canada, support is provided at the local level rather than at the national level. 47 see www.eban.org 406. Front-end and back-end tax incentives aim to increase the number of BAs as well as the amount of capital invested. Typically, incentives are conditional on the shares being held for a minimum number of years or the capital gains being reinvested in new ventures. For instance, in 2008, Italy introduced tax relief for business angel investments, which consists of a tax exemption for capital gains on the sale of a startups' undertakings, provided that the start-up is less than seven years old, that the investor holds the shares for at least three years, and that the capital gains are reinvested in another start-up in the next two years (OECD, 2014b). 407. Japan has introduced an angel tax system since 1997, which comprises reduced taxation on capital gains and carry forward of losses. However, as angel taxation was only used for a small amount of investments, to further increase angel funding, the system was amended in recent years with the introduction of an income exemption system, whereby, under specific conditions, BAs can deduct from their annual income an amount of money substantially equivalent to the investment carried out in the same year (OECD, 2011a). 408. Another common supply-side measure consists in the creation of co-investment funds, which match public funds with those of private investors that are approved under the scheme. In some cases these funds target all seed and early stage investors, including also VC funds (see Box 9), but there exists also programmes that are especially focused on BAs. In the UK, the Angel CoFund invests amounts of GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million into SMEs with high growth potential, working in partnership with syndicates of experienced BAs.	n
New metrics are being developed for scholarly publications to assess their impact outside of academia.	"New metrics are being developed for scholarly publications to assess their impact outside of academia. One such metric is the Altmetric Attention Score,34 indicating ""how many people have been exposed to and engaged with a scholarly output"".35 For any research output, the Attention Score ""provides an indicator of the amount of attention that it has received"",36 with some sources having more weight than others. For instance, coverage in the news has the highest weight of 8, since ""it's easy to imagine that the average newspaper story is more likely to bring attention to the research output than the average tweet"".37 Other high-weight sources include blogs (5), Wikipedia (3), policy documents (3) and Twitter (1). Altmetrics are relatively new, having commenced in 2012. They have been recognized as ""tools that aim to measure the real-time reach and influence of an academic article"".38 Academics found ""positive but relatively weak correlation with citations"",39 supporting the idea that ""citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts"".40 Mentions in blogs are particularly ""able to identify highly cited publications""41 - an empirical finding that supports the important weight assigned to blogs within the altmetric algorithm, further highlighting the increasing importance of this form of dissemination of scientific material."	n

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed.	Most food sold in Brunei must be certified as halal. However, there is a small market for non-halal foods, which must be sold in designated rooms in grocery stores separated from other products or at restaurants that are specified as non-halal. The Ministry of Religious Affairs administers Brunei's halal standards, which are among the most stringent in the world. Regulations enacted in May 2017 require all businesses that produce, supply, and serve food and beverages to obtain a halal certificate. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed. However, under Brunei's Halal Meat Act, halal meat (including beef, mutton, lamb, and chicken) can be imported only by a person holding a halal import permit and an export permit from the exporting country. Additionally, the importers and local suppliers of halal meat must be Muslim. The Bruneian government maintains a list of the foreign and local slaughtering centers (abattoirs) that have been inspected and declared fit for supplying meat that can be certified as halal. Brunei's stringent system of abattoir approval involves on-site inspections carried out by Bruneian government officials for every establishment seeking to export meat or poultry to Brunei. Halal meat must be kept separately from non-halal meat at all times, and halal certification must be renewed annually by the Brunei Religious Council.	n

To identify the industries to be supported, this approach proposes to learn from countries with similar endowments but somewhat higher income levels.	Building on these rationales, several approaches further develop thinking on industrial policy. The New Structural Economics stresses the shiftin comparative advantage that results from changes in endowments. The large productivity spillovers from infrastructure and associated coordination failures justify a leading role for the state. To identify the industries to be supported, this approach proposes to learn from countries with similar endowments but somewhat higher income levels. Exports with a solid track record by these countries indicate which sectors could have a comparative advantage as the economy grows.a BOX 6.9 Once again, the debate rages over industrial policy Source: World Development Report 2013 team.

The most critical outcomes were increased health service coverage and improved quality of health services provided by CHWs.	A total of 96 submissions were obtained, with representation largely from policy-makers, planners, managers and researchers involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of CHW programmes. The majority of the respondents were from the African Region; a limitation was that CHWs themselves were not adequately represented in this group. All outcomes of the CHW interventions were deemed to be at least important and several were rated as critical. The most critical outcomes were increased health service coverage and improved quality of health services provided by CHWs. Most of the health policy and system interventions under consideration in the guideline were also deemed to be acceptable and feasible for implementation. Acceptability and feasibility were uncertain for a few interventions considered, such as the use of essential and desirable attributes to select CHWs for pre-service training; these included, for example, selecting CHWs on the basis of age and completion of a minimum secondary level of education. The findings of the survey - presented in Annex 5 - informed the development of evidence to decision tables and ultimately the recommendations by the GDG. 32 WHO guideline on health policy and system support to optimize community health worker programmes Recommendations Recommendation 1: Selection for pre-service training Recommendation 1A WHO suggests using the following criteria for selecting CHWs for pre-service training: * minimum educational level that is appropriate to the task(s) under consideration; * membership of and acceptance by the target community; * gender equity appropriate to the context (considering affirmative action to preferentially select women to empower them and, where culturally relevant, to ensure acceptability of services by the population or target group); * personal attributes, capacities, values, and life and professional experiences of the candidates (e.g. cognitive abilities, integrity, motivation, interpersonal skills, demonstrated commitment to community service, and a public service ethos).	n

For example, it would include the Footprint needed to manufacture products that are exported and consumed by people outside the country.	"Part 2 Ecological accounting is the sum of the Footprints for all resources harvested and all waste generated within the country's geographical borders. For example, it would include the Footprint needed to manufacture products that are exported and consumed by people outside the country. This includes all the area within a country necessary for supporting the actual harvest of primary products (cropland, grazing land, forest land, and fishing grounds), the country's infrastructure and hydropower (built-up land), and the area needed to absorb fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions generated within the country (Carbon Footprint). The consumption Footprint differs from the production Footprint through trade: a country's consumption Footprint also contains the biocapacity of imported products and services. When biocapacity is made available to other countries through exports, this is reflected in the consumption Footprint of the importing country. When the Footprint of a country exceeds the biocapacity of the area available within that country, it runs an ""ecological deficit"" and we call it an ""ecological debtor."" Conversely, an ecological surplus exists when the biocapacity of a region exceeds its population's Footprint. Those countries with more biocapacity at their disposal than their population uses, in net terms, have an ""ecological surplus"" and are called ""ecological creditors"". Ecological surplus or deficit is analogous to a trade surplus or deficit. In a global economy, it is important to understand whether a country has a trade surplus or deficit. In the same way, knowledge of its ecological balance sheet also reveals important information. To maintain high-quality results when conducting Footprint analysis, Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have developed international standards. The standards are designed to ensure that Footprint assessments are produced consistently and according to communityproposed best practices. They aim to ensure that assessments are conducted and communicated in a way that is accurate and transparent. land types used in ecological ."	n

In 2018, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) proposed a set of regulations called the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, which is an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006. The proposed regulations would prescribe the labeling requirements for prepackaged foods to display essential information on where the food is manufactured, processed, served, and stored. The proposed regulation also allows FSSAI to establish an internal mechanism to address problems arising out of the implementation and/or interpretation of the regulations. The government of India mandated standard retail package sizes for 19 categories of foods and beverages effective November 1, 2012, via an amendment to the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. This rule has not been notified to the WTO, nor was there a specific public comment period for domestic stakeholders prior to implementation. As the United States does not impose specific standards for packaging size, and U.S. package sizes tend to be in English rather than metric units, the list of package sizes prevents many U.S.-origin products from entering India. Attempts to import such U.S.-origin products have resulted in rejection at the port of entry. These standards have a negative effect on trade, with numerous U.S. brands effectively excluded from the Indian market. The United States continues to raise FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 241 concerns about these standards in various bilateral and multilateral fora in an effort to ensure that U.S. products have access to the Indian market.	n
Nevertheless, some peoples appear to move more than others and in different ways from others, which appears to be closely linked with the level of development in each country, which, in turn, is linked with the distribution of the population in each country.	Rethinking international migration, internal migration, mobility and urbanization That migration is the most problematic of the population variables is taken as given. Unlike the unique events of birth and death that define an individual's lifetime, migration can be a multiple event. Its measurement depends entirely upon how it is defined in time and across space. ... Despite all the problems inherent in the collection of migration data, significant progress has been achieved over recent years. The compilation of a world origin-destination database, developed originally at the University of Sussex and now much extended and maintained by the United Nations Population Division and the World Bank, has provided the framework for a more precise measurement of global international population movement.a These data showed that about 3 per cent of the world's population lived in a State or territory not of their birth and that that proportion had not changed significantly since the 1990s ... As the systems of internal and international migration evolve and change, so too, does the nature of the linkages between them ... other forms of short-term mobility emerge from essentially urban cultures and economies. ... The idea that most people do not move or are fixed at a specific location might be appealing but it is wrong. Mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility. Nevertheless, some peoples appear to move more than others and in different ways from others, which appears to be closely linked with the level of development in each country, which, in turn, is linked with the distribution of the population in each country. Despite all the difficulties with the measurement of internal migration as sketched above, considerable progress has been made towards the construction of analytical models that allow the comparison of patterns across space.

Products that conform to harmonized ENs (HENs) under the NLF are 1 Official Journal of the European Communities, C 136, 4.6.1985, p. 1.	"The EU's approach to standards-related measures, including its conformity assessment framework, and its efforts to encourage governments around the world to adopt its approach, including European regional standards, creates a challenging environment for U.S. exporters. In particular, the EU's approach impedes market access for products that conform to international standards as opposed to European regional standards (called European harmonized standards or ENs), even though international standards may meet or exceed the EU (or third country) regulatory requirements. U.S. producers and exporters thus face additional burdens in accessing the EU or other markets not faced by EU exporters and producers in accessing the U.S. market. In 1985, the EU adopted what is known as the ""New Approach"" to the use of standards for products.1 The ""New Approach"" was updated in 2008 and rebranded as the ""new Legislative Framework"" (NLF). The NLF represents a package of measures meant to clarify EU product marking requirements, establish a common legal framework for industrial products, and improve product safety, often through the involvement of market surveillance authorities.2 Product requirements in a variety of sectors (e.g., toys, machinery, medical devices) are regulated through NLF legislation. Under the NLF, EU legislation sets out the ""essential requirements"" that products must meet in order to be placed in the EU market and benefit from free movement within the EU.

In economies with a population of more than 100 million as of 2013, Doing Business covers business regulation in both the largest and second largest business city.	Another assumption underlying the Doing Business indicators is that entrepreneurs have knowledge of and comply with applicable regulations. In practice, entrepreneurs may not be aware of what needs to be done or how to comply with regulations and may lose considerable time trying to find out. Alternatively, they may intentionally avoid compliance--by not registering for social security, for example. Firms may opt for bribery and other informal arrangements intended to bypass the rules where regulation is particularly onerous--an aspect that helps explain differences between the de jure data provided by Doing Business and the de facto insights offered by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys.6 Levels of informality tend to be higher in economies with particularly burdensome regulation. Compared with their formal sector counterparts, firms in the informal sector typically grow more slowly, have poorer access to credit and employ fewer workers--and these workers remain outside the protections of labor law and, more generally, other legal protections embedded in the law.7 Firms in the informal sector are also less likely to pay taxes. Doing Business measures one set of factors that help explain the occurrence of informality and provides policy makers with insights into potential areas of regulatory reform. a.

The capacity and resources to work land are generally the limiting factors to cultivation in many areas of Mozambique (GoM 2001c). However, there was a low incidence of land conflict as millions of people returned to rural areas after the war ended, with the allocation of land being managed through local processes and with local leaders (Tanner 1996). The 1997 Land Law represented an important effort to integrate customary and formal legal frameworks, to secure land rights for communities, families and individuals, and stimulate development in rural Mozambique. It emerged from an unparalleled process of dialogue and collaboration between the government, civil society, and specialists (Tanner 2002). Some conflicting interests in land and resource use did emerge in post-war Mozambique, particularly in areas near Maputo (McGregor 1997). The community survey found that the post-flood resettlement program caused tensions in these areas.	n

Both these labor supply and demand side perspectives on the role of agriculture would suggest that increasing labor productivity during the structural transformation should mainly happen through a reduction of the agricultural labor force and that to do so, policies should especially focus on removing barriers to sectoral (and spatial) migration.

Both these labor supply and demand side perspectives on the role of agriculture would suggest that increasing labor productivity during the structural transformation should mainly happen through a reduction of the agricultural labor force and that to do so, policies should especially focus on removing barriers to sectoral (and spatial) migration. Yet, even though popular, there are a number of important caveats to these perspectives. For example, recent evidence indicates that the frequently cited agricultural productivity gap measures based on the national accounts abstract from a series of confounding factors and measurement issues, which exaggerate the gap. This suggests that the gains from sectoral movements, and thus the incentives to move, may not be as large as commonly purported. Furthermore, the view that labor is less productive in agriculture --a viewpoint that is especially well established in macro policy circles --has often also been taken as evidence that labor in agriculture is intrinsically less productive, and thus less worthy of investment. This sits oddly with the agricultural success stories of agro-exporters such as the United States and the Netherlands, and more recently also Vietnam, Chile, and Peru.	n

A range of pull factors, including earning potentials, attract individuals into the sector.	There is a wide variety of informal nonagricultural self-employment activities in Coted'Ivoire, and many individuals choose to operate in the sector. From a legalistic standpoint, being informal means that the establishment (operating unit) or the employee is not registered. As in many countries in the region, the median owner of a nonagricultural microenterprise tends to be young females with no formal education. The majority of nonagricultural individual enterprises are in small-scale service activities, but these enterprises persist over time. In fact, in contrast to common perceptions, many individuals declare preferring self-employment over other types of occupations. A range of pull factors, including earning potentials, attract individuals into the sector. For rural households, nonagricultural activities represent a source of income diversification to mitigate harvest risks or seasonal variations, and often a pathway out of poverty. Still, as Chapter3 has highlighted, off-farm diversification remains limited in rural Coted'Ivoire and there might be scope to further encourage it.	n

There are several types of secondary schools: general, Islamic and vocational.	Country Notes Basic education in Indonesia consists of 9 years of compulsory education. Primary education lasts for six years. Secondary education is divided into junior (Sekolah Menengah Tingkat Pertama -SMTP), senior (Sekolah Menengah Tingkat Atas -SMTA) and vocational/technical education. Junior secondary school covers three years and is part of the basic general education programme also covering the six years of primary education. Senior secondary school also covers three years. There are several types of secondary schools: general, Islamic and vocational. Sekolah Menengah Atas is divided into three sessions. In the third year of senior secondary school, students choose between Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Languages (Bahasa). Graduates of the senior secondary schools obtain the Sekolah Menengah Atas, which is a prerequisite for access to higher education (together with an entrance exam).	n

This urbanization pattern comes along with a high wage premium for skilled labor (laborers with higher education) who tend to earn on average about as much in other urban areas as in Abidjan, and about three times more than unskilled laborers in these urban areas (the highest locational skill premium) (Table 2.1).

Self (> 75% INC) on farm (> 75% INC) Nonagricultural wage (> 75% INC) smaller) share of the rural population (4 percent) is engaged in nonagricultural wage employment. This is most likely linked to the high degree of Coted'Ivoire's urbanization and urban concentration with most firms and nonagricultural wage employment confined to Abidjan. Fifty-three percent of the population is urban, of which 40 percent lives in Abidjan (Figure2.11). In 2012, less than 10 percent of formal jobs were outside Abidjan (Figure5.10), with the vast majority of new formal jobs continuing to be generated in Abidjan (Figure5.16), and only very few in other urban areas (mainly in agribusiness). This urbanization pattern comes along with a high wage premium for skilled labor (laborers with higher education) who tend to earn on average about as much in other urban areas as in Abidjan, and about three times more than unskilled laborers in these urban areas (the highest locational skill premium) (Table 2.1). The low difference in wages for highly skilled workers between Abidjan and other urban areas suggests that a wage premium is needed to attract skilled labor to other urban areas (possibly also because of underdeveloped public services in these areas).	n

In the U.S., obesity and CVD are among the leading causes of health problems and death.	Objective Goals Status Objective 1 Document the effects of peanut oil consumption on energy balance and blood lipid profiles. Continuing Objective 2 Document the effects of peanut oil consumption on hunger, food intake and total diet quality. Continuing Objective 3 Evaluate potential mechanisms that account for the less than predicted influence of peanut consumption on body weight. Continuing Objective 4 Explore the effects of peanut consumption as a snack versus meal component on hunger, satiety and daily food intake. Continuing Objective 5 Provide training in methods for human dietary behavior research. Continuing 1.2 budget: The budget for 2004-2005 was $100,000. This evaluation covers the period from 1 August 2001 to the present. Seventeen million people worldwide die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. Low and middleincome countries contribute 85% of CVD deaths. By 2010, CVD will be the leading cause of death in developing countries. There are over 300 million obese adults and 1.1 billion overweight people worldwide. In the U.S., obesity and CVD are among the leading causes of health problems and death. Hence, the scientific/technical importance of this project's objectives is very relevant economically, socially and environmentally.	n
Education influences access to employment sectors.	Education influences access to employment sectors. In Coted'Ivoire, most low-skilled individuals are concentrated in agriculture, while individuals with secondary education or higher are more likely to be employed in the wage sector (Figure6.13). As indicated above, the share of individuals with less than secondary education is high, so that the majority of the population is in fact concentrated in the bottom of the education distribution, and as such mostly work in agriculture and nonagricultural self-employment. Nonagricultural self-employment involves individuals from all levels of education.	n

Another thematic area that could attract more attention is intra-regional labour and asylum related migration flows and what is termed (perhaps erroneously) South-South migration.

Each of these countries faced a different jobs challenge, so their policy choices are relevant for other countries confronted with similar jobs agendas.	Diverse jobs agendas, diverse policy priorities Following a protocol to identify constraints to the creation of good jobs for development, and then remove or offset them, may sound abstract. But some countries have successfully done this in practice, and it is possible to learn directly from their experiences (box 9.2). The stories of Vietnam, Rwanda, Chile, and Slovenia, show that policy can effectively support the creation of jobs with high development payoffs. Each of these countries faced a different jobs challenge, so their policy choices are relevant for other countries confronted with similar jobs agendas. Getting the fundamentals right by ensuring macroeconomic stability, improving the business environment, and adhering to the rule of law, featured prominently in all four cases. All four countries also embraced labor policies and institutions within a reasonable range. But it is telling that the main constraints they targeted were not in the labor market.	n

In all these countries, the proportion of households with persons with disabilities cooking with coal and/or wood is higher in rural areas than in urban areas.	Household air pollution may especially be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where in 2013 more than half of the population still used solid fuels for cooking and heating. Even in the Americas and Europe, the regions where use of solid fuels is the lowest, the population using solid fuels is still significant at 25 per cent in the Americas and 23 per cent in Europe.350 Furthermore, available data from 14 developing countries, around 2010, show that in all countries a higher proportion of households with persons with disabilities than without persons with disabilities cooks with wood or coal (Figure II.73). On average, 53 per cent of households with persons with disabilities versus 46 per cent of households without persons with disabilities use these traditional forms of energy for cooking. The percentages of households with persons with disabilities that cook with wood and/or coal vary from 1.4 per cent in Iran to 97 per cent in Tanzania. Households with persons with disabilities in rural areas are particularly affected, as the wood and coal are used for cooking in 66 per cent of these households compared to only 32 per cent of households with persons with disabilities in urban areas, on average (Figure II.74). In all these countries, the proportion of households with persons with disabilities cooking with coal and/or wood is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Displaced persons with disabilities living in camps are also affected, as almost all energy used for cooking in these camps comes from charcoal and firewood.335 Figure II.73.

Since the education system constitutes the main source of skills acquisition for most individuals, continued improvements in access to education, as well as rapid gains in learning through improvements in the quality of education services will be critical for Coted'Ivoire's competiveness.	Quality of primary education in Coted'Ivoire also lags behind other Sub-Saharan African countries, limiting the skills that children can acquire in school. For instance, students at CM2 level (fifth grade of primary school) are behind relative to other Francophone countries in the region (Figure10). Math scores are particularly low and less than 25 percent meet minimum competence requirements. French scores are more comparable to the average level obtained in other countries but still less than 45 percent are meeting minimum requirements.

Our second issue for 2017 was a Special Issue (guest editors, Alexandra Ricard-Guay, European University Institute, and Thanos Maroukis, University of Bath) focused on human trafficking in domestic work looking at severely exploited migrant women domestic workers in different European countries. Contributions to this special issue highlighted the gaps in human trafficking research that has focused typically on sex work overlooking 'shadow' areas such as live-in domestic work, au-pairs turned into slaves, and pointed to the gaps in national and European anti-trafficking legislation. Papers in this special issue showed how migrant domestic and care work is part and parcel of welfare systems in the ageing European societies and analysed both sociologically and legally the case of trafficking in domestic work. The findings highlighted how loose conditions surrounding domestic and care work in private homes can lead to vulnerability and severe exploitation. Indeed we could speak of a 'slippery slope' where migrant live-in workers are not aware of their rights and families who employ them are not aware of their obligations while the state fails both to monitor and control this sizeable labour market sector. Thus extra working hours and low payment, may slowly become no payment at all, restriction of one's privacy and liberty, severe physical and emotional abuse, thus raising a case of trafficking rather than simple exploitation.	n
In contrast, the focus in this project is on nutritional aspects related to peanuts and satiety, which arguably has a stronger level of interest in the U.S.A. than in developing countries.	This project is unique in being quite different and discrete from other projects in the food safety/food science Peanut CRSP cluster, which is dominated by food safety goal of controlling or reducing exposure to aflatoxins. In contrast, the focus in this project is on nutritional aspects related to peanuts and satiety, which arguably has a stronger level of interest in the U.S.A. than in developing countries. But the training and transfer of scientific skills and knowledge in the nutrition field has much wider relevance. The research being undertaken is very novel and has potential for promotion of peanut consumption as a healthy food, hence had great potential impact. This is a sound project area and the translation of the outcomes for practical benefit is obvious and shows potential impact.	n
In Cote d'Ivoire, there are various ethnic groups, each with a different language, culture and customs.	Summary of Country Gender Profile in Cote d'Ivoire (2013) General Situation of Women  Following the end of the long political crisis in 2011, Cote d'Ivoire is making efforts toward to restoration. However, because of long turmoil of the crisis, statistical data is insufficient, and the development of statistics and a population registration system are pressing issues.  In Cote d'Ivoire, there are various ethnic groups, each with a different language, culture and customs. The social status of women varies in each ethnic group. Generally, the social and economic status of women is low, and they have inadequate access to basic social services and less economic power compared to men. Government Policy  The government of Cote d'Ivoire has adopted policies and action plans to promote gender equality. It is important to assure the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these actions.  The strategy for the fight against gender based violence (GBV) was established in 2012, and it is now in the implementation phase of the action plan.  A project to develop a database of talented women is ongoing under the initiative of the Presidential Office as a way to evaluate and utilize the capacities and talents of women across the country. National Machinery  In 1976, the Ministry for Condition of Woman (Ministere de la Condition de la Femme) was established. Since then, the ministry has been in charge of promoting gender equality. However, the budget has not been sufficiently allocated. Therefore, the allocation of an adequate budget and the establishment of administrative capacity are required.  Gender Groups have not been established in all ministries. Sufficient budget allocation and human resources are challenges for the Gender Groups.	n
ENFORCING CONTRACTS Doing Business measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court (table 8.15) and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that promote quality and efficiency in the court system.	ENFORCING CONTRACTS Doing Business measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court (table 8.15) and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that promote quality and efficiency in the court system. The data are collected through study of the codes of civil procedure and other court regulations as well as questionnaires completed by local litigation lawyers and judges. The ranking of economies on the ease of enforcing contracts is determined by sorting their scores for enforcing contracts. These scores are the simple average of the scores for each of the component indicators (figure 8.18).	n
These include watershed management and promote increased agricultural productivity through strategies such as climate-smart agriculture, water conservation, soil fertility management, erosion control and soil management.	In support of agroforestry, which accounts for almost 75% of the country's land area, Rwanda is implementing the Rwanda Biodiversity Policy and the Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture 4 (PSTA 4) 2018- 2024, both of which advocate agroforestry, among other FLR practices that promote best practice. These include watershed management and promote increased agricultural productivity through strategies such as climate-smart agriculture, water conservation, soil fertility management, erosion control and soil management. Another key policy that supports agroforestry is the national horticulture policy, which promotes fruit tree planting by establishing incentive mechanisms, strengthening value chains and developing markets for horticulture products; it has a significant effect on the promotion of FLR in Rwanda. In particular, the horticulture policy promotes the establishment of village nurseries for fruit trees. Other policies that support agroforestry include the Agroforestry Strategy and Action Plan 2018-2027, which is being developed to promote leadership and synergies in agroforestry as well as to engage coordinated action and implementation in Rwanda's National Forestry Policy and National Agriculture Policy.	n

The Manual contains technical specifications and guidelines for the inclusion of the aforementioned warnings on processed food labels and in media advertisements.	"The ""Healthy Food Promotion Act for Children and Adolescents"" (Law No. 30021), and its 2017 implementing regulations published in Supreme Decree No. 017-2017-SA, establish a mandatory front-ofpack warning statement on food labels for pre-packaged foods and beverages that surpass thresholds set by Peru for sugar, sodium, and saturated fats, and for all food products that contain trans-fats. The Act also establishes limitations on advertising and promoting such food and beverage products to children and adolescents, which include restriction on the promotion, advertising, and sale of these products in or around schools. While supportive of Peru's public health objective of reducing obesity and related non-communicable diseases, the United States has a number of questions and concerns with Peru's approach. For example, it is not clear whether Peru considered relevant international standards or less-trade restrictive alternatives when preparing and adopting the measure to improve the quality of nutritional information provided to consumers. The United States has raised these concerns in written comments on the measure and in meetings of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. In September 2017, Peru notified its manual on health warnings, prepared pursuant to the Regulations Implementing Law No. 30021 to the WTO TBT inquiry point. The Manual contains technical specifications and guidelines for the inclusion of the aforementioned warnings on processed food labels and in media advertisements. In November 2017, the United States submitted written comments to Peru raising its concerns with the measures established by the Manual. In June 2018, Peru published the Manual in its federal register. Manufacturers will be permitted to use temporary stickers to comply with the Manual for 6 months starting June 2019 before needing to use packaging that conforms to the Manual starting December 2019. In 2019, the United States will continue to monitor ongoing developments related to these issues and engage with Peru as appropriate."	n

Across GPE developing country partners, on average, more girls than boys are still out of primary and lower secondary school, and girls' out-of-school rates for lower secondary have stagnated over the past three years.	Across GPE developing country partners, on average, more girls than boys are still out of primary and lower secondary school, and girls' out-of-school rates for lower secondary have stagnated over the past three years. This means that girls are falling farther behind boys in access to lower secondary education. Likewise, progress on lower secondary out-of-school rates in FCACs is erratic, and DCPs in the lower left quadrant of Figure 2.8 are especially facing challenges. 16. Out-of-school rates track the number of primary-school-age children who are not in school, as a proportion of all primary-school-age children; the same applies for lower secondary.	n

Law enforcement policy therefore needs to be carefully designed, keeping in mind both the objective of drug control and the possible unintended results.	"29. In any drug control system, supply reduction and the enforcement of regulations will always be an important element of an integrated and balanced approach. Efforts to suppress the illicit production and supply of drugs, when properly designed and implemented, are essential tools for reducing the social and health damage resulting from illicit drug markets. 30. In recent years, some criticisms have singled out efforts to suppress the illicit supply and use of drugs, claiming that they are failed policies on the grounds that drug abuse remains prevalent. The logic behind that argument is questionable. Nobody has advocated abandoning the global response to AIDS or hunger because those problems have not been eliminated. Rather, those efforts are held to be the more reasonable standards for improving the situation, compared with the alternative of inaction. 31. All other things being equal, higher prices--which may result from a more restricted illicit supply due to law enforcement efforts--will lead to reduced demand. But higher drug prices can affect not only the problems associated with drug-taking but also the problems associated with drug trafficking and with law enforcement efforts. Where the extent of the trafficking falls less than proportionally to the increase in prices, more vigorous law enforcement activity may increase the total revenue available to traffickers and thus increase the incentive to engage in that illicit trade and to struggle for dominance within that trade. 32. Law enforcement policy therefore needs to be carefully designed, keeping in mind both the objective of drug control and the possible unintended results. It is not the case that the world must choose between ""militarized"" drug law enforcement and the legalization of non-medical use of internationally controlled drugs. The conventions do not mandate a ""war on drugs""."	n

Between January and March, the police oversight mechanism, the Independent Amnesty International Report 2017/18 215 Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) received 73 new complaints of assault and documented 42 killings by law enforcement officials.	"Between January and March, the police oversight mechanism, the Independent Amnesty International Report 2017/18 215 Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) received 73 new complaints of assault and documented 42 killings by law enforcement officials. During the year, 168 people were killed by law enforcement officials, compared with 111 people in 2016. Female relatives of those allegedly killed by the police continued to battle an underfunded, sluggish court system in their fight for justice, truth and reparation.1 More than a year after a Commission of Enquiry published its findings into the events that took place in Western Kingston during the 2010 state of emergency that left at least 69 people dead, the government had still not officially responded on how it planned to implement the recommendations, or made a public apology. In June, the Jamaica Constabulary Force completed an internal administrative review into the conduct of officers named in the Commissioners' report. However, it found no misconduct or responsibility for human rights violations during the state of emergency.

Many of those arrested were entrapped by security forces through online dating applications.	"In the worst crackdown in over a decade, the authorities across Egypt rounded up and prosecuted people on the grounds of their perceived sexual orientation after a rainbow flag was displayed at a concert in Cairo on 22 September. These prosecutions provoked a public outcry. Security forces arrested at least 76 people and carried out at least five anal examinations, a practice which amounts to torture. Those arrested included a man and a woman who were detained for three months for carrying the rainbow flag at the concert, as well as people who made online expressions of support for the raising of the flag. Many of those arrested were entrapped by security forces through online dating applications. Courts sentenced at least 48 people to prison terms of between three months and six years on charges that included ""habitual debauchery"". The other people arrested remained in detention facing questioning by prosecutors. In late October, a group of parliamentarians proposed a deeply discriminatory law explicitly criminalizing same-sex sexual relations and any public promotion of LGBTI gatherings, symbols or flags. The proposed law carried penalties of up to five years' imprisonment, or 15 years' imprisonment for a person convicted of multiple charges."	n
Review how this dramatic situation affected the Footprint.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of depending on large resource flow from elsewhere? What would you do if you were in the Japanese government's position? North Korea. Following the collapse of the * Soviet Union, Korea's imports of oil and coal were significantly reduced. Moreover, China could not supply sufficient quantities of rice. Reductions in supplies of fossil fuel also led to reductions in biocapacity because North Koreans had less fertilizer, could not fuel their tractors, and were not able to produce as much food as in the past. Review how this dramatic situation affected the Footprint. The Footprint curves show the significant reduction in consumed food. Some estimate that about two million people may have died due to lack of food.	n
Some of the officers involved in the incidents were seconded to the National Narcotics Agency.	Human rights groups reported unlawful killings and other serious human rights violations by security forces, primarily in the context of excessive use of force during mass protests or during security operations. No perpetrators were known to have been held to account, particularly for numerous incidents in Papua. EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE Between September 2016 and January 2017, joint police and military forces carried out security operations in Dogiyai, Papua province, during the run-up to the 2017 local elections. On 10 January police officers arbitrarily arrested Otis Pekei when he refused to hand over a knife at a police checkpoint, and detained him at the Moanemani sub-district police station. Later that day, police delivered Otis Pekei's body to the home of his family; the family accused the police of torturing him during detention. No investigation was known to have been conducted. On 1 August in Deiyai, Papua province, police officers arbitrarily opened fire into a crowd of protesters without warning, wounding at least 10 people, including children. Nine police officers were subjected to disciplinary action; no criminal proceedings were known to have been opened. UNLAWFUL KILLINGS The number of killings by police of suspected drug dealers increased sharply, from 18 in 2016 to at least 98 in 2017. Some of the officers involved in the incidents were seconded to the National Narcotics Agency. Police claimed that all the killings were in self-defence or because suspects tried to flee the scene. No independent investigations were known to have been conducted into these killings. The number of deaths escalated after several high-ranking Indonesian officials, including the President, 196 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 advocated during the year for tougher measures to address drug-related crime, including calling for the application of unrestrained lethal force against suspected traffickers.	n
A person's state of health is determined by features of the social environment - poverty (Goal 1), hunger (Goal 2), education (Goal 4), work (Goal 8), gender (Goal 5), economic inequality (Goal 10) and peace (Goal 16) - and the physical environment - clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), energy (Goal 7) and climate (Goal 13).

A person's state of health is determined by features of the social environment - poverty (Goal 1), hunger (Goal 2), education (Goal 4), work (Goal 8), gender (Goal 5), economic inequality (Goal 10) and peace (Goal 16) - and the physical environment - clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), energy (Goal 7) and climate (Goal 13). The health of persons with disabilities, like everyone's health, is affected by these determinants. Moreover, all of the specified targets of Goal 3 are relevant to persons with and without disabilities. Target 3.8 concerning UHC is of notable importance, because it is the primary mechanism for achieving other Goal 3 targets and because persons with disabilities tend to have less access to health care.	n

In these countries, the percentage of women without disabilities who have ever attended school is close to that of men without disabilities, thus suggesting that attitudinal and physical barriers against persons with disabilities are a factor explaining the low rates of school attendance of women with disabilities.	The evidence suggests that, depending on the country, gender discrimination or barriers for persons with disabilities (e.g. lack of accessibility and discrimination on the grounds of disability) may play a bigger role. In Benin, Mali, South Sudan and Togo, the gap is wider between women (both with and without disabilities) and men, but narrower between women with and without disabilities. The ratios of men with disabilities who have ever attended school are closer to those of men without disabilities. This suggests that gender discrimination plays a major role in schooling. In Brazil, Indonesia, Tunisia and Timor-Leste, the gap is wider between persons with disabilities (both women and men) and persons without disabilities.

In particular, investments in sustainable and quality infrastructure in the region are needed to allow Asia to maintain its growth momentum, adequately address climate change and bring down high levels of persistent poverty.	For Asia alone, estimates by the Asian Development Bank (ADB, 2017) point to investment needs of around USD 26 trillion until 2030 (including climate-related needs). This is supported by GI Hub (2017) and McKinsey (2016) who see around 50% of their respective investment need estimates related to the Asian region.7 Spending under the BRI strongly contributes to financing Asia's infrastructure needs. Nonetheless, a cumulative gap of about USD 4.6 trillion, or over four times USD 1 trillion estimated for BRI foreshadowed projects, is expected to emerge by 2040 (GI Hub, 2017). In particular, investments in sustainable and quality infrastructure in the region are needed to allow Asia to maintain its growth momentum, adequately address climate change and bring down high levels of persistent poverty.	n

Extrusion was used to produce high quality texturized meat substitute from fermented and unfermented peanut flour. (2) High consumer acceptance of peanut-based fish nuggets incorporating up to 15% defat peanut flour. Addition of peanut flour masked the muddy taste of catfish and fishy taste of tilapia. Consumers' test showed that the product has potential for commercialization. The sensory characteristics of the best fish nuggets were further optimized via enhanced formulation and optimized extrusion technologies. Overall, the extrusion process produced a better texture, improved flavor product compared to the non-extruded fish nuggets.	n

Secondary school enrolment has increased but remains lower than primary school enrolment.	Secondary school enrolment has increased but remains lower than primary school enrolment. Although gender disparities in access to secondary education have been reduced, they remain wider and more prevalent than at the primary level--to the advantage of boys in some countries and of girls in others. Gender disparities are even broader at the tertiary level. Female participation in tertiary education overall has increased globally and currently surpasses male participation in almost all developed countries and in half of developing countries. However, women are clearly underrepresented in fields related to science, engineering, manufacturing and construction. Women are also underrepresented in the more advanced degree programmes, especially in science-related fields, resulting in fewer women than men in research. Women account for 30 per cent of all researchers--an increase compared to previous decades but still far from parity.	n

When you hear the word 'globalization,' what comes first to mind?	"Empirical evidence to a large extent confirms this upbeat assessment. Labor earnings and working conditions improve as countries grow richer, and global integration has been good for growth. Across developing countries, a 1 percent increase in a country's openness, measured as the share of its foreign trade in its output, has been associated with a 1 percent increase in GDP per capita.62 Gains may reach up to 1.5 percentage points on average in the case of openness in financial services and telecommunications.63 Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, where trade liberalization was viewed with skepticism, the increase in output growth rates could be in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent.64 Evidence also shows that firms engaged in global markets pay higher wages. This is true of exporting firms from Colombia to Morocco and from Mexico to Korea. It is also true of foreign-owned companies, whether they operate in Cameroon or Competing for jobs? 244 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 Note: The figure is based on the following question and answer: Question: ""There are multiple consequences of the globalization of trade.

These include, beyond better access to finance, other complementary inputs such as business services support, access to information about foreign markets, and public inputs such as quality standards.	In the context of Coted'Ivoire, two factors stand out as possible constraints to output demand growth: transport infrastructure and logistics, and firm capabilities. As in most countries, rapid expansion of demand is most likely to occur in tradable sectors. Coted'Ivoire has an advantage over many other landlocked countries but its logistic performance index (LPI) is barely above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. The cost of export and import based on Doing Business data is inexplicably more expensive than landlocked countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali.105 For smaller firms in particular, reaching the regional market might be an important 104 Doing Business data on Minimum wage/Ratio of minimum wage to value added per employee: Kenya: 269.4/1.4, CI: 119.0/0.5, Senegal: 185.6/1.1, Cameroon: 70.3/0.3, Burkina Faso: 107.9/1, Sri Lanka: 79.3/0.2, Ghana: 60.1/0.3, Mali:62/0.5, Vietnam: 142.5/0.6 105 See http://www.doingbusiness.org/Custom-Query/cote-divoire channel for export. Yet road and rail transport infrastructure in Coted'Ivoire is inefficient and expensive, contributed to by entrenched monopoly, inefficient quota system, and pervasive roadblocks and corruption demands in the north such as along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor (WorldBank 2014, 2015b). Successful demand accumulation also requires a certain degree of firm capabilities. As argued earlier, the fact that Ivorian firms are significantly less able to survive in sectors with a high rate of foreign entry suggests the need to improve capabilities for domestic firms. These include, beyond better access to finance, other complementary inputs such as business services support, access to information about foreign markets, and public inputs such as quality standards. The next section discusses some of the policy tools toward this goal.	n
Educational attainment--the highest level of education an individual has completed--is a measure of human capital and the skills available in a given population.	Educational attainment--the highest level of education an individual has completed--is a measure of human capital and the skills available in a given population. Whereas current enrolment rates only provide information on the school population at a given time, educational attainment indicates the education level of an entire adult population, reflecting long-term trends in participation and completion of primary, secondary and tertiary education. Higher levels of educational attainment are reflected in the availability of a relatively high level of skills and knowledge in the labour force. Progress in educational attainment contributes to economic growth56 and improved labour market outcomes, including in productivity, participation, and income and career progression.

Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration.	Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration. Some migration journeys are highly gendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity. Many other migrations, the majority, include both boys and girls, though sometimes in different ratios, depending on country of origin. Much child migration, particularly outside the context of conflict or disaster, is safe and undertaken as part of a family unit. However, there is an increasing tendency for children to be involved in migration that jeopardizes their safety and violates their rights. Examples of this type of migration include not only the obviously life-threatening forced migrations across treacherous routes - such as the Eastern and Central Mediterranean, where drownings are frequent - but also migrations where children are routinely exposed to physical and/or sexual violence. Unsafe migration also includes situations where children rely on exploitative intermediaries who take advantage of the need for migration assistance to extract labour or other types of services from children in their custody. The discussion focuses on these aspects of child migration.	n

However, in writing this chapter, we acknowledge that the many ways in which migrants contribute to societies are currently being overlooked, downplayed or taken for granted, and it is the purpose of this chapter to bring these contributions of migrants to the forefront.	n

Countryspecific studies shed further light on employment impacts across different population groups.	The impact of the 2008-09 crisis varied across developing countries. Some, such as the Baltic countries, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mexico, Romania, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey, had absolute declines in employment; other countries such as Brazil, China, and Indonesia experienced only a brief deceleration. Countryspecific studies shed further light on employment impacts across different population groups. For example, it is estimated that the crisis cost China between 20 million and 36 million jobs, particularly among migrant workers in export-oriented sectors.58 In Mexico, it caused a decline of half a million jobs between 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, particularly among women, youth, and older workers, as well as a 10 percent drop in real wages.59 In Indonesia, although the effects of the crisis were mild, young, casual, and informal workers were affected.60 Across countries, the young bore the largest brunt.61 Adjustment patterns, in terms of jobs lost or earnings declines, also varied in developing F I G U R E 1.11 In developing countries, the crisis affected earnings more than employment Source: Khanna, Newhouse, and Paci 2010.

Thai law enforcement's investigative and prosecutorial capacity is limited, and Thai laws focus predominantly on abuse of office rather than financial or asset-related malfeasance.	"Despite ongoing legislative and administrative efforts to address corruption, the issue continues to hamper Thailand's economy and trade. The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is the primary body vested with powers and duties to counter corruption in the public sector. However, several agencies have jurisdiction over corruption issues, and their actions are not always complementary. Thai law enforcement's investigative and prosecutorial capacity is limited, and Thai laws focus predominantly on abuse of office rather than financial or asset-related malfeasance. Anticorruption mechanisms continue to be employed unevenly and for political purposes, and the lack of transparency in many administrative procedures serves to facilitate corruption. In October 2017, NACC issued ""guidelines on appropriate internal control measures for juristic persons to prevent bribery of state officials, foreign public officials, and agents of public international organizations"" to address the supply side of corruption. On July 22, 2018, a new anti-corruption law (known officially as the Act Supplementing the Constitution Relating to the Prevention and Suppression of Corruption B.E. 2561 (2018)) came into effect, repealing and replacing the 1999 Organic Act on Counter Corruption and its various amendments. The new anticorruption law maintains a key provision criminalizing bribe-giving by legal entities but expands the definition of the legal entities to include any foreign company (registered abroad but operating in Thailand) and its associated persons (employees, joint venture partners, agents, etc.). The mandatory fines for bribery are at least an equal amount of the benefit received from the corrupt act, but not more than twice that amount. The 2018 law allows NACC to seek international cooperation in investigations."	n
Plan appropriately with respect to prescription drugs, health insurance, vaccinations, and other matters, including dietary needs and preferences.	Prepare in advance to make your trip smoother and more productive. * Schedule meetings before leaving the United States. Determine whether an interpreter will be required and, if so, make all necessary arrangements before arriving. Business language is generally more technical than the conversational speech that many travelers can handle--and mistakes can be costly. The U.S. Commercial Service can assist in locating qualified translators. * Prepare new business cards in as many languages and sizes as necessary. In most countries, exchanging business cards at the first meeting is considered good business manners. As a matter of courtesy, it is best to carry business cards printed both in English and, if applicable, in the language of the country being visited. * Prepare for different weather conditions. Seasonal weather conditions in the countries being visited are likely to be different from conditions in the United States. * Address health care issues. Plan appropriately with respect to prescription drugs, health insurance, vaccinations, and other matters, including dietary needs and preferences. * Find out about the electrical current in each of your destinations. A transformer, plug adapter, or both may be needed to demonstrate company products, as well as your own electronics--such as laptops or tablets for presentations. * Think about money. U.S. banks can provide a list of automatic teller machines overseas, exchange rates, and traveler's checks. * Consider transportation. Be aware of public and private transportation available in each country you'll be visiting and have a plan for getting around. Arrange as many needs as possible (e.g., hiring a driver) before you arrive. * Prepare for differences in culture. Become familiar with basic cultural communication such as hand signals, street signs, and tipping conventions. U.S. Commercial Service commercial officers and specialists can teach you much about new cultures.	n
The situation presents a dilemma for the future; if technology transfer is mandated as part of the program, then funds for these activities must be provided, or USAID must accept that there may be failures to realize the benefits and impact of the research outputs.	The Peanut CRSP was successful in establishing linkages with agencies interested in technology transfer and extension activities. This activity was not mandated by the program design, but this happened because the participants, especially in the host countries, were interested in development. The situation presents a dilemma for the future; if technology transfer is mandated as part of the program, then funds for these activities must be provided, or USAID must accept that there may be failures to realize the benefits and impact of the research outputs. It seems that both USAID and the Management Entity have to work harder to convince USAID missions to consider Peanut CRSP-developed technologies in their plans for agricultural development.	n

CHWs are often trained unimodally to specialize in the care of a single patient condition, such as diabetes or HIV (181, 182). There are examples where CHWs have been integrated, using various approaches and with varying levels of success, in primary care teams to deliver a broader range of services, though often with a predominant focus on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services (183-186). 7.12.2 Rationale for recommendation This policy question stood out for the lack of eligible evidence in both the specific systematic review addressing this question and in the systematic review of reviews.

The strongest demand for English speakers comes from foreign banks and investment companies, MNCs and public institutions.	For 24 of the 30 companies interviewed, English is their primary business language, used for internal and external communication. For the remaining seven companies, Bengali is the primary language. However, for these companies English is required as a second language, and on average 41% of employees speak English. All of these factors underline the importance of English in the workplace and for the economy in general, and show why a high proportion of the population want to improve their English skills to the highest possible degree. The strongest demand for English speakers comes from foreign banks and investment companies, MNCs and public institutions. Only nine companies would consider employing candidates with only a basic level English, while the remaining companies seek to recruit employees with intermediate or good skill levels. This underlines the fact that Bangladeshi professionals with a strong command of English have more and better opportunities to get good jobs in private businesses.	n
Farmers in this region adopt a direct-seeding method of crop establishment to save labor costs.	The Mekong River Delta has three major cropping seasons: spring or early season, autumn or midseason, and winter, the long-duration wetseason crop. The largest rice area is cropped during the autumn season (1.95 million ha), followed by spring (1.45 million ha), and only a small area is cropped in winter (0.6 million ha). The rice yield is highest in the spring season (5.3 t/ha), and lowest in the winter season (3.3 t/ha). Farmers in this region adopt a direct-seeding method of crop establishment to save labor costs.

"The qualitative data built up a picture of the ""system"" within which rice cropping is practiced capturing interconnections between socioeconomic, institutional, environmental, and climatic components."	"Following the household surveys and semistructured interviews, focus groups were held with two groups of rice farmers (land owners and sharecroppers) in a village accessed through the networks of a local NGO as a final validation exercise. This involved resource mapping exercises followed by open discussions surrounding key themes that emerged from the household survey and semistructured interviews.

The approaches of the TEEB Study and the Ecological Footprint differ from one another primarily on one point: Whereas the Footprint views a purely bioproductive area as starting capital, independent of its biodiversity, TEEB focuses on this diversity in its economic contexts.

To understand the role of business entry and exit in job creation, we decompose aggregate employment growth into job creation (by new and expanding firms) and job destruction (by contracting and existing firms).96 Coted'Ivoire exhibits a very high level of job churning driven by firm entry and exit, even compared to other low-income countries.	Net changes in employment hide a considerable amount of job creation and destruction. Cross-country evidence (such as Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta 2009) has found a high degree of employment turbulence in both developed and developing countries, indicated by simultaneously large gross job creation and destruction. To understand the role of business entry and exit in job creation, we decompose aggregate employment growth into job creation (by new and expanding firms) and job destruction (by contracting and existing firms).96 Coted'Ivoire exhibits a very high level of job churning driven by firm entry and exit, even compared to other low-income countries. In 2007-2010 the total job creation and destruction rates in Coted'Ivoire were around 25 percent and 20 percent of total employment, respectively. For the United States (1980-2009) these figures are around 15 percent. Li and Rama (2015) provide an overview of job creation and job destruction rates for developing countries. All countries with available data exhibit gross job creation and destructions below 18 percent, much lower than Coted'Ivoire. For example, Ethiopia's (1997-2007) gross job creation and destruction rates are about 17 percent and 10 percent, respectively.	n
Three dimensions emerge as critical in its analysis: wellfunctioning financial markets, a strong business environment, and strong labor skills.	In addition to the academic literature, a number of consulting firms provide analysis and rankings of the attractiveness of countries based on the views of top executives of multinationals. A.T. Kearney has published a Foreign Direct Investment Index since 1998. Three dimensions emerge as critical in its analysis: wellfunctioning financial markets, a strong business environment, and strong labor skills. A separate index for the location of services also emphasizes skills, particularly language skills, and the degree of global integration. Labor typically accounts for a larger share of overall costs in services than in manufacturing.	n
While efforts have been made in this sense in the past years, submissions are still dominated by scholars from the Global North.	While the thematic coverage of the journal will continue to evolve with the new developments in forced migration, the Refugee Survey Quarterly will remain dedicated to publish high quality and original articles on issues of both academic and policy interest. In this regard, the journal is thankful to peer reviewers who have kindly offered their time and expertise, despite the increasingly demanding workload entailed by academic positions. One of the main challenges for the years to come will be to further diversify the geographical origin of contributors to the Refugee Survey Quarterly. While efforts have been made in this sense in the past years, submissions are still dominated by scholars from the Global North. This is not peculiar to the Refugee Survey Quarterly, but more broadly reflects the prevailing biases in academic research and publications.	n
The biggest declines came from cultural resources and business travel, health and hygiene and tourist service infrastructure.	Eastern Africa is a close second to Southern Africa in terms of competitiveness but did experience stagnation since the last edition of the report. Overall, Eastern Africa tops the broader Sub-Saharan Africa average on nine pillars, ties on three, and is the top-ranked subregion on seven. Compared to the Sub-Saharan Africa average, it maintains a minor disadvantage regarding price competitiveness, which is still its highest-scoring pillar, and a larger gap on ICT readiness. Eastern Africa's most significant advantages over Southern and Western Africa comes from better ground and port infrastructure. However, it is on natural resources where the subregion outperforms the global average. Eastern Africa lost competitiveness on seven pillars. The biggest declines came from cultural resources and business travel, health and hygiene and tourist service infrastructure. However, these losses were offset by strong growth on price competitiveness and enhancements to air and ground infrastructure.	n

Crop modeling to integrate knowledge Crop modeling enables researchers to integrate knowledge from different disciplines in a quantitative way.	"Crop modeling to integrate knowledge Crop modeling enables researchers to integrate knowledge from different disciplines in a quantitative way. That, in turn, helps researchers to understand the underlying processes that determine the behavior of complex agricultural systems. Mathematical models are representations of systems made from mathematical equations. Integrating and solving the equations enable a numerical description of the system to be produced. During the first phase of a modeling exercise, the modeler seeks to give names, magnitudes, and units to the component parts of the problem. In the second phase of modeling a problem, the processes are described as mathematical functions. In the final phase, ""what-if"" questions can be asked about the functioning of a system and numerical answers provided. Mathematical models that contain no clear logical link with the basic processes governing the relationship between the system inputs and outputs are unlikely to contribute much of significance to any debate concerning strategic decisions in relation to research management."	n

Similar, but smaller, errors can arise in analyzing a production chain when the end product is used to produce the raw materials used to make the end product (e.g.	Double counting: In order not to exaggerate human demand on nature, Footprint Accounting avoids double counting, or counting the same Footprint area more than once. Double counting errors may arise in several ways. For example, when adding the Ecological Footprints in a production chain (e.g., wheat farm, flour mill, and bakery), the study must count the cropland for growing wheat only once to avoid double counting. Similar, but smaller, errors can arise in analyzing a production chain when the end product is used to produce the raw materials used to make the end product (e.g. steel is used in trucks and earthmoving equipment used to mine the iron that is made into the steel). Finally, when land serves two purposes (e.g. a farmer harvests a crop of winter wheat and then plants corn to harvest in the fall), it is important not to count the land area twice. Instead, the yield factor is adjusted to reflect the higher bioproductivity of the double-cropped land.	n

Hong Kong also maintains a dedicated and effective enforcement capacity, a judicial system that supports enforcement efforts with deterrent fines and criminal sentences, and youth education programs that discourage IPR-infringing activities.	Hong Kong generally provides robust intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement and for the most part has strong laws in place. Hong Kong also maintains a dedicated and effective enforcement capacity, a judicial system that supports enforcement efforts with deterrent fines and criminal sentences, and youth education programs that discourage IPR-infringing activities. On the other hand, Hong Kong's failure to modernize its copyright system has allowed it to become vulnerable to digital copyright piracy. Lacking an updated copyright system, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (HKCED) has stepped up enforcement actions to combat digital piracy. In addition, while the HKCED routinely seizes IPR-infringing products arriving from mainland China and elsewhere, U.S. stakeholders report that counterfeit pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and other infringing products continue to transit through Hong Kong in significant quantities. These products are typically destined for both the Hong Kong market and markets outside of Hong Kong.	n

The Ecological Footprint is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere.	The Ecological Footprint is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere. More precisely, it measures the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to produce all the resources an individual, population, or activity consumes, and to absorb the waste they generate, given prevailing technology and resource management practices. This area can then be compared with biological capacity (biocapacity), the amount of productive area that is available to generate these resources and to absorb the waste. If a land or water area provides more than one of these services it is only counted once, so as not to exaggerate the amount of productive area actually available. Land and water area is scaled according to its biological productivity. This scaling makes it possible to compare ecosystems with differing bioproductivity and in different areas of the world in the same unit, a global hectare. A global hectare represents a hectare with world average productivity.	n

And to adapt it to other health related campaigns, such as TB, Ebola, Zika etc.	Fake news and misinformation are predominantly generated through messaging services like WhatsApp, which play a major role for our target group. In order to convey reliable information and fight fake news one must use the same communication channels and mechanisms. WhatsApp is a powerful tool for this kind of campaigns for several reasons: messages come directly to the user's phone, from known contacts, and therefore seem more credible, the immediacy of message delivery can create a feeling of urgency about particular topics and it can be used to penetrate communities that do not have access to other platforms. Various measures have been taken in the past to curb the viral spread of fake news - with limited success. Fighting misinformation is important. But instead of just reacting, NGOs and government organizations should be enabled to create viral SBCC campaigns for mobile communication channels by themselves. We are looking for NGOS that would partner with us to disseminate this information. And funding partners to expand the project. The project is sustainable as it is entirely digital and open source. We are actually planning to use it in as many languages/regions as possible. And to adapt it to other health related campaigns, such as TB, Ebola, Zika etc.	n

In February 2014, the average number of hours worked a week was around 41.8, with a median around 42 (Figure1.12a). Only 20 percent of employed individuals worked less than 30 hours a week. By contrast, 40 percent of individuals report working more than 60 hours a week. Nonetheless, there are some differences in the number of hours worked by type of employment. Agricultural employment is known to exhibit substantial seasonality, with much lower work during the lean seasons. Individuals in agricultural self-employment worked the least hours compared to other occupations in February 2014, in part due to seasonal patterns (see discussion in Chapters 2 and 3). As discussed in Chapter2, this seasonality in agricultural employment explains a substantial share in differences in average labor productivity across sectors. However, individuals in nonagricultural self-employment work slightly more hours (47.6 ) than those in wage employment (46.7) (Figure1.12c). Among wage workers, it is individuals in the public sector who work less (41.4) than their counterparts in the private formal (45.8) or informal sectors (46.6) (Figure1.12d).	n

Spain's main points of attraction are its excellent natural (9th) and cultural (3rd) resources, with the latter being its greatest advantage relative to the rest of the world.	Selected Country/Economy Analysis Spain remains the most competitive economy in the world when it comes to T&T. The nation is the second-most visited destination in the world and has developed an economy that is focused on tourism, with over half of internal T&T spending coming from international visitors. Spain's main points of attraction are its excellent natural (9th) and cultural (3rd) resources, with the latter being its greatest advantage relative to the rest of the world. The country is a centre for international meetings (4th) and sporting events and has the strongest combination of intangible culture and heritage sites (1st) in the world. The number of UNESCO-recognized Natural Heritage sites has also increased (11th to 9th), helping to boost the attractiveness of its natural assets (23rd to 10th). Servicing travellers is an exceptional tourism infrastructure (3rd), including a high hotel density. Intra-country travel is supported by quality railroads (11th) and roads (13th), while good port infrastructure (12th) could help the cruise industry. The nation's many international arrivals can rely on strong air transport infrastructure (10th), which includes a wide range of operating airlines (5th) that provide a considerable route capacity (8th). Moreover, like much of higher-income Europe, the country performs well in areas related to its overall enabling environment (33rd), with a solid global relative advantage on ICT readiness (27th) and security (16th).	n

"The state of a person's health is shaped not only by one's access to health services, but by a multitude of factors, which are termed the ""determinants of health""."	"The World Health Organization (WHO) defines good health as a ""state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"".3 This recognition of mental and social well-being, in addition to physical well-being, is critical, and emphasizes the importance of viewing health holistically. The state of a person's health is shaped not only by one's access to health services, but by a multitude of factors, which are termed the ""determinants of health"". Figure 1 shows how the determinants of health can be applied to migrants across the migration cycle. Individual determinants are factors such as age, sex and genetic predisposition to disease, and the epidemiological profile of a given context and the disease exposures associated with it. Structural determinants are usually politically mediated - such as legal frameworks and societal attitudes towards migrants - and can result in a range of inequalities in socioeconomic status. For migrants, structural determinants of health include the conditions associated with the different phases of their migration journey - pre-migration, movement, arrival and integration, and (for some) return. 3 WHO, 1946. 212 Migration and health: Current issues, governance and knowledge gaps Fi gu re 1 .

Involving the client, in turn, calls for interpersonal skills and cultural sensitivity on the part of the service provider.	Aspects of Service Exports Services can be crucial in stimulating goods exports and are critical in maintaining those transactions. Many U.S. merchandise exports would not take place if they were not supported by such service activities as banking, insurance, and transportation. The many obvious differences between services and products include differences in tangibility and customer involvement. Because services are intangible, you may find that communicating a service offer is more difficult than communicating a product offer. Also, services frequently must be tailored to the specific needs of the client. Such adaptation often necessitates the client's direct participation and cooperation. Involving the client, in turn, calls for interpersonal skills and cultural sensitivity on the part of the service provider.	n
Tuvalu, Palau, and Papua New Guinea specify a physician or medical practitioner must be involved in the regulatory body.	Composition of NRBs The NRBs in Australia and Oceania are generally composed of nurses, public members, and other health officials. While all NRBs include nurses, Micronesia is the only jurisdiction whose National Board of Nursing is composed entirely of nurses. Most of the Oceanic jurisdictions (Australia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga) also include members of the public on their regulatory bodies. Several jurisdictions (Australia, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Palau, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu) have NRBs with members of other health professions serving on their nursing regulatory body. Tuvalu, Palau, and Papua New Guinea specify a physician or medical practitioner must be involved in the regulatory body. Kiribati and Vanuatu also include a lawyer on their regulatory body, and Nauru includes a member of the clergy. NRB members are appointed by the government in Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu. In five countries (the Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Palau, the Solomon Islands, and Tonga), the NRB www.journalofnursingregulation.com 51Volume 10 * Special Issue * January 2020 members are nominated by the profession and confirmed by the government and/or minister. There is no information on the selection process for Tuvalu's NRB members. Most NRBs in this region require nurses on the NRB to be actively enrolled as a nurse and in practice for 3 to 5 years (Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu). Additionally, in the Marshall Islands and Palau, the public member on the Board cannot be a member of any health-related profession, cannot have a conflict of interest, and must have at least a high school diploma or its equivalent.

It also ranks first on intangible heritage and cultural and entertainment digital demand, second for sports stadiums and eight for business events.	China is by far the largest T&T economy in Asia-Pacific and the 13th most competitive globally (up two spots from 2017). It welcomes more international visitors than any other country in the region and its T&T industry benefits from a large and growing domestic market. The cornerstone of China's competitiveness is its exceptional natural resources (4th) as well as the TTCI's highest score for cultural resources. The nation has the greatest number of UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites in the world as well as impressive wildlife (6th). It also ranks first on intangible heritage and cultural and entertainment digital demand, second for sports stadiums and eight for business events.

Moreover, travel is facilitated by an extensive list of air carriers (7th) that have produced the second-largest airline capacity in the world. Intra-country travel is also made easier by one of the world longest railway networks, which gets relatively positive marks for quality (17th) and efficiency (25th). However, given China's future tourism potential and needs, more investment needs to be diverted to enhancing the quality of roads (42nd), airports (53rd) and ports (55th).	n
Among the manuscripts submitted to IMR, we prioritize those that have reach beyond specific disciplines, perspectives, or methodological approaches and that situate their findings vis-a-vis wider international trends.	International Migration Review (IMR) focuses on the interdisciplinary study of international migration. It publishes 30 to 40 articles a year, along with shorter research notes and book reviews. Led by an interdisciplinary editorial team from economics, sociology, and geography and guided by an international and interdisciplinary editorial board, IMR seeks to publish articles that both are grounded in rich empirics and push the boundaries of how, where, and from what perspective we examine the complexities of international migration. The interplay between the two 'I' words associated with IMR - interdisciplinary and international - guides what we, as editors, seek in publications.

These pushbacks by police, sometimes from deep inside Croatian territory, routinely involved coercion, intimidation, confiscation or destruction of private valuables and the disproportionate use of force by the police.	"Croatia continued to return to Serbia refugees and migrants who entered the country irregularly, without granting them access to an effective asylum process. These pushbacks by police, sometimes from deep inside Croatian territory, routinely involved coercion, intimidation, confiscation or destruction of private valuables and the disproportionate use of force by the police. In July, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Croatia had acted against the rules of the Dublin Regulation (which defines which EU member state has the obligation to evaluate the asylum claims) by allowing transit for refugees and migrants through the country in 2015 without examining applications for international protection. The NGO Centre for Peace Studies documented that between January and April, at least 30 asylum applications - including those from families with children - had been dismissed on the grounds of ""security concerns"" during a routine security check carried out by the Security and Intelligence Agency as part of the asylum process. The notes of these applications were marked as ""classified"" and could not be seen and thus could not be rebutted or challenged on appeal by those seeking asylum or their legal representatives. Cases with classified notes led to an automatic rejection by the Ministry of Interior. Subsequently, the failed asylumseekers were at risk of expulsion from the country and at heightened risk of refoulement - a measure forcing an individual to return to a country where they would risk serious human rights violations."	n

Environmental studies shed light on the carbon F I G U R E 9.	Misaligned incentives exist when good jobs for development are not rewarding enough to individuals or profitable enough to farms and firms. Data and analysis can be used to identify gaps between the individual and the social value of jobs. Arguably, many key areas in development economics deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can be applied to measure the tax burden on capital and labor and to assess the extent of cross-subsidization between individuals or firms. Labor economics methods can be used to uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kinds of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on poverty reduction. Productivity studies can help quantify the spillovers from employment in FDI companies, in firms connected to global markets, or in functional cities.

Access to finance is a constraint, as indicated by the relatively low levels of capital intensity and high rate of returns to capital in Ivorian firms.	Comparisons of firm dynamics patterns and business climate with a set of comparator countries lead to a range of potential policy actions. Access to finance is a constraint, as indicated by the relatively low levels of capital intensity and high rate of returns to capital in Ivorian firms. Within Coted'Ivoire's formal sector, there seems to be substantial heterogeneity in capital constraints across sectors and firm size. In contrast to conventional wisdom, smaller firms are not necessarily more capital constrained. At the institutional level, Coted'Ivoire still has margin for improvements in its access to finance regulations, due to a lack of a credit registry or credit information sharing, and a movable collateral registry. Doing Business reforms in these areas could reduce the overall cost of lending and improve access to finance especially for smaller and less-established firms. In addition, for the small and medium firms in particular, combating corruption and lack of competition in the transport sector, will help improve their access to regional markets. Indeed, in the short run, growth in output demand is most likely to come from tradable sectors, but high transportation costs due to outdated infrastructure and inefficient logistics are limiting Ivorian firms' ability to reach regional and global markets.	n

Although there is large scope for area expansion regionally, in locations where access to good arable soils is limited, expansion of upland rice cultivation can Rice in Cote d'Ivoire. 82 Rice almanac occur only by shifting out of other crops, by reducing the fallow period, or by exploiting soils less well suited to rice cultivation. Farm-level yields are low, averaging about 1 t/ha, and vary as a function of local soil and rainfall conditions. Moderate technical potential for increasing yield exists through improved management. Progressive farmers applying moderate input levels can now achieve yields of 2.5 t/ha, and yields of 4 t/ha and greater are commonly achieved on research stations.	n

Factory opportunities and other jobs associated with the city's free trade zone have been shrinking in recent years. Participants in a Santiago focus group said that women found work BOX 1.2 Jobs bring earnings opportunities to women, but also new difficulties more easily than men because employers have ""more confidence in them [the women]."" Increased labor force participation is not without challenges. The women in Santiago worry about their safety because of assaults, theft, and gang violence; many think it is too dangerous to work at night. Despite the expansion of work opportunities, mobility continues to be a constraint not only because of poor transportation and safety risks but also because of the roles women play as incomeearners and as caregivers in the household.

While the urban population can be reached through traditional and social media, in rural Sierra Leone information also flows through traditional leaders.	In Sierra Leone, one way that the government builds awareness at the national level is through radio, for which the Ministry of Health and Sanitation has developed several broadcasts in 13 local languages, with local leaders disseminating information on the virus. While the urban population can be reached through traditional and social media, in rural Sierra Leone information also flows through traditional leaders. Their involvement was key during the Ebola response and the same course of action has been taken this time. Students attending radio lessons received regular reminders on COVID-19 as part of their scheduled lessons. As recent cases have emerged in informal settlements, some local leaders have initiated their own COVID-19 sensitisation training, joined by medical practitioners, social workers, the police. Results from a survey conducted in the Freetown area on the effectiveness of the above interventions indicated that over 95% of respondents had heard of COVID-19, with 90.3% being able to correctly identify at least one symptom; however, 41% of respondents believe that COVID-19 is man-made. (Grieco et al, 2020) Despite the government's efforts to provide accessible, accurate information, disinformation is commonly circulated through social media. The official response to counter these rumours has been slow.

Figure 8 shows the USD 1 090.4 billion foreign company investments broken down into the main industrial sectors and two sub-periods: 2005-2013, and the shorter, more recent 2014-2017 period. Prior to 2014, half of the USD 468 billion was in the energy sector and USD 88.8 billion was in metals (together around 68% of the total). Real Estate at USD 38.3 billion and Finance at USD 37.7 billion (mainly due to considerable investments in advanced-economy banks around 2008) were the third and fourth most important investments in the earlier nine-year period. In the period 2015-2018 the amount of investment is larger than in the preceding nine years, and its composition has shifted away from energy, metals and finance, towards a much more diversified set of industries. The main beneficiaries of the switch are: agriculture (seeds, agro-chemicals and processing); technology (especially robotics, medical, cloud computing, imaging and telecommunications), transport (mainly aviation, shipping, and rail); tourism; real estate; and the ""other"" category (including consumer goods and textiles)."	n

When the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) adopted GPE 2020, its strategy for 2016-2020, partners chose to tackle the learning crisis head-on by focusing on education quality and equity. This Results Report 2019, the third for the current strategy, shows that GPE is making important headway toward improving learning for all children. More children are entering and completing school across partner countries, and there is encouraging progress in learning. Partners are working together to build a strong and sustainable foundation for learning, with improvements in sector planning and increased investments in data and learning assessment systems. Going forward, to be transformative these efforts need to be bolstered by consistent and inclusive monitoring of progress, as well as increased and better use of existing national systems. Inequity is a global challenge that goes beyond our sector and requires significant attention. Education gaps based on wealth and geographic location are still wide but narrowing, while the gap between girls and boys remains steady. This report provides valuable insight into where partners must focus resources to go that extra mile to make sure education systems meet the needs of the most marginalized children and break down the barriers keeping them out of school or not learning. Focusing on those left furthest behind is not just the right thing to do, but also the best way to improve overall learning outcomes and reduce inefficiency.	n

Implementing WARDA's research strategy comprises four essential elements: * Technology generation for sustainable development * Technology dissemination and farmer empowerment * Policy research * Capacity building and training of key agents of change WARDA's rainfed and irrigated area programs result in improved technologies for the respective environments. These programs address technology generation and dissemination, from upstream strategic research targeting specific constraints to the application and integration of different technology components in farmers' fields. WARDA's Rice Policy and Development Program addresses the overall environment in which the proposed technology will be disseminated and used, from the farm level up, including higher aggregation levels such as watersheds, markets, agroecological zones, nations, and regions. This program thereby focuses on problems that cut across ecosystems, particularly with respect to policy research and scaling-up technology dissemination. The fourth principal element, capacity building and training, is not specifically linked to any particular program. Instead, it is integrated into each program under the coordination of a training unit.	n

According to the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, an additional US$44 billion each year would need to be mobilized from international financing to fill the gap for all low-and middle-income countries to achieve universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education.	Financing and partnership Mobilizing more and better financing for education is a key strategic objective of GPE 2020, as is building a stronger partnership. According to the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, an additional US$44 billion each year would need to be mobilized from international financing to fill the gap for all low-and middle-income countries to achieve universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education.1 However, more financing is not the only challenge: External financing should be allocated to the countries with the greatest education need, and used to support those interventions directly associated with learning for all children. This chapter presents an overview of the GPE grant portfolio,2 using the most recent data to examine where GPE funding goes, and the performance of GPE grants. It also discusses challenges in the alignment of grants to education systems and wider efforts to advocate for more and better financing for education. 5.1 GPE grant portfolio .	n

It is a life-cycle process that proceeds in consecutive stages, each of them building on the previous one. Of crucial importance are adequate health and nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life, from inception to two years of age. Brain development in this period affects physical health, learning abilities, and social behavior throughout life.29 In the early years, a child develops all the basic brain and physiological structures upon which later growth and learning depend. Stunting in early childhood has been proven to have a significant negative effect on cognitive development; iodine deficiency can lead to poor brain development; and insufficient cognitive stimulation reduces learning abilities. Ensuring adequate nutrition, health, and cognitive Beyond labor policies 297 forcing the rules that govern transactions and helping ensure that the costs and benefits of growth are fairly distributed.42 The justice system can enforce contracts, reduce transaction costs for firms, and create a safe and more predictable business environment.43 The presence of effective courts increases the willingness of firms to invest.44 An institutional environment that respects rights is another integral part of the rule of law. The International Labour Organization's core labor standards provide guidance on what is unacceptable in the areas of child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association and collective bargaining.45 Health and safety at work also necessitate attention by governments and employers. Ensuring that standards are enforced in practice requires providing access to information to workers and employers. Information can increase the extent to which workers are able and willing to hold employers and intermediaries accountable. It can also help ensure that all parties involved are aware of their obligations. Strengthening institutions for enforcement and grievance redress is another necessary building block. revealed that, in diverse countries, a significant share of students were unable to read a single word: around 30 percent in Honduran rural schools, 50 percent in The Gambia and more than 80 percent in Mali.34 Enrollment numbers, hence, do not necessarily signal actual learning and skill building.	n

Cultural practices that decrease the need for pesticides include rotating crops, selecting resistant varieties (when possible), planting and harvesting at the proper time, and using integrated pest management (IPM) techniques.	"Reducing pesticide use is one of the best ways to protect fish and wildlife resources. Using sound cultural practices reduces pest problems and, therefore, results in lower pesticide use. Cultural practices that decrease the need for pesticides include rotating crops, selecting resistant varieties (when possible), planting and harvesting at the proper time, and using integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. IPM is a farming approach that employs alternative methods of pest control, rather than relying solely on agrichemicals. With IPM, pesticides are used only when the cost of applying a pesticide is outweighed by the cost of pest damage to the crop. This ""threshold"" must be reached before chemical pest control is economically justified. In this way, IPM practices help to reduce pesticide use and protect wildlife and the environment."	n

This research also showed that, on average for all the studied countries, salaries for English speakers versus non-English speakers were around 25% higher. This is a major incentive for individuals to improve their English, and it is broadly accepted in each country that a good degree and strong language skills lead to economic prosperity and individual wealth."	n
The development of more efficient industries and services encourage a reallocation of labor toward more productive uses.	Winners and losers The obvious winners of globalization are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered tasks have migrated. Outsourcing and offshoring, along with the attendant transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and improvements in living standards. The development of more efficient industries and services encourage a reallocation of labor toward more productive uses. It also stimulates the subsequent development of other interrelated industries and sectors through backward and forward linkages. The development of a modern services sector can lead to greater coordination in value chains and make a further subdivision of tasks and the reorganization of production possible, leading to economies of scale.55 Multiple actors--including multinationals, civil society organizations and consumers in industrial countries--are increasingly active in efforts to improve working conditions and workers' rights in developing countries. To the extent that such efforts bear fruit, enhanced export opportunities improve workers' well-being.56 In all these ways, significant trickle-down effects can have widespread benefits for recipient countries.	n

"BOX 4.2 Trends in the contribution of PPM approaches to TB case notifications ""Public-public"" mix refers to engagement by a country's NTP with public health sector providers of TB care that are not under the direct purview of the NTP. Examples include public hospitals, public medical colleges, prisons and detention centres, military facilities and public health insurance organizations. ""Public-private"" mix refers to engagement by the NTP with private sector providers of TB care. Examples include private individual and institutional providers, the corporate or business sector, mission hospitals, nongovernmental organizations and faith-based organizations. Engaging with all health providers through PPM approaches is essential to achieve universal access to TB prevention and care services. Other benefits include easing the heavy workload of NTPs and accelerating the introduction of new technologies. Trends in the contribution of PPM to notifications in selected countries where PPM has been recognized as a priority, and data for countries that have reported to WHO each year during 2012-2018, are shown in Fig. B4.2.1 (public-public mix) and Fig. B4.2.2 (public-private mix). Countries that have prioritized public non-NTP sector engagement, clearly shown by increasing trends in the contribution of this sector to TB case notifications, are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. Prioritization of private sector engagement is visible from trends in notifications in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Philippines. National TB inventory studies that quantify the underreporting of detected TB cases in both public and private sectors can help to identify the types of PPM approaches that should be prioritized, since they identify the type of providers that are diagnosing and treating a large proportion of the total number of detected TB cases."	n

Significant effort over the next 5-10 years will be required to achieve success in this demanding field.	Scientifically this is an area that is attractive and could, if brought to fruition, offer practical assistance to minimizing pre-harvest aflatoxin levels in peanuts. There is no doubting the scientific competence of the Principal Investigator and his ability to make a success of this demanding area. However, the change in the Principal Investigator, change of direction scientifically, and poor interactions with host countries have all hampered progress in this project. The funding from Peanut CRSP has been limited and there is not much evidence that there has been leverage to gain further funds from other sources. Significant effort over the next 5-10 years will be required to achieve success in this demanding field. The project will also need to find a motivated collaborating scientist in Benin to meet the Peanut CRSP requirements.	n
What does the evaluation team see as the reasons behind successful interventions?	The evaluators should identify major lessons learned about increasing the relevance and effectiveness of donor support to anti-corruption efforts, including for improving the lives of poor people and women. Where applicable they should relate these to individual or collective donor programs and partner countries. The following specific questions should be addressed: 1. What do the donors see as the main lessons learned after years of anti-corruption support? 2. What do the national authorities see as the main lessons learned after years of receiving donor support to reduce corruption? 3. What do non-state actors including groups representing the poor and women, consider as main lessons for future work to address corruption? 4. What does the evaluation team see as the reasons behind successful interventions? 5. What does the evaluation team see as the reasons for major disappointments? 6. Did disappointments happen after deliberately taking risks, because of poor planning and understanding, or because of changes in circumstances? 7. What can be learned from the positive and negative cases?	n

Multilateral cooperation among the States members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) continues, as the regional multilateral body formulates its next approach, subsequent to the prior goal of making the ASEAN region free of illicit drugs by 2015. A ministerial statement adopted at the third ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Drug Matters, held in Indonesia in December 2014, underscored the political commitment to further strengthening regional cooperation. In September 2014, the ASEAN Narcotics Cooperation Centre was launched in Bangkok as a coordinating platform to further the pursuit of that goal of regional cooperation. The 12th meeting of the ASEAN InterParliamentary Assembly Fact-Finding Committee to Combat the Drug Menace, held in Kuala Lumpur in June 2015, provided an opportunity for the exchange of information on the latest national developments. A resolution adopted at the meeting emphasized the significance of taking a people-centred approach in the delivery of effective demand and supply reduction programmes.

Some Doing Business indicators, however, capture procedures, time, and costs that involve private sector participants, such as lawyers, notaries, architects, electricians, or freight forwarders.	"The Doing Business indicators are ""actionable."" For example, governments set the minimum capital requirement for new firms, invest in company and property registries to increase their efficiency, or improve the efficiency of tax administration by adopting the latest technology to facilitate the preparation, filing, and payment of taxes by the business community. Governments also undertake court reforms to shorten delays in the enforcement of contracts. Some Doing Business indicators, however, capture procedures, time, and costs that involve private sector participants, such as lawyers, notaries, architects, electricians, or freight forwarders.

Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project.	Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3.

These contextual factors undermine resilience in myriad ways often reinforcing low-return rice cropping that precludes wealth generation, necessitates coping, and does not provide farmers with resources to respond adequately to climate shocks.	Although the coping strategies undertaken by rice farmers partly contribute to the persistence of vulnerability, e.g., through depletion of assets, increases in, or maintenance of, debt, they do not fully explain why vulnerability occurs or persists. These coping strategies can be seen as symptoms of the absence of resilience; ultimately a range of contextual factors interact to maintain this low-productivity, low-resilience state of rice farming. These contextual factors undermine resilience in myriad ways often reinforcing low-return rice cropping that precludes wealth generation, necessitates coping, and does not provide farmers with resources to respond adequately to climate shocks. For example, the institutions governing land access mean many households operate small plots that do not generate sufficient returns because there is no surplus to sell. Thus small and insecure land holdings act as a break on income accrual and asset accumulation that can be used to smooth the impact of crop losses following climate hazards.	n

However, mortality rates are increasing in several of the high-HDI countries with the greatest increases in incidence.	Global trends: Colorectal cancer trends vary substantially worldwide, even within levels of HDI. Incidence rates are decreasing in some very high-HDI countries, such as the US, Israel, and Japan.69 These countries have had widespread uptake of screening programs and early-detection programs since the 1990s, which resulted not only in decreasing mortality, but also in decreasing incidence due to the detection and removal of precancerous lesions. In other very high-HDI countries with decreasing incidence and no longstanding screening programs, such as Australia, New Zealand, and some European countries, decreasing incidence is likely due to favorably changing risk factors.69 In contrast, incidence rates are increasing in other very high-HDI countries including Sweden, Italy, and Slovenia, as well as several lower-HDI countries undergoing rapid human development transition, likely due to increased prevalence of risk factors such as unhealthy diet, obesity, and smoking.69 The most rapid increases of about 3% or more annually over the past 10 years are in high-HDI countries such as Costa Rica (men); Brazil (women); and Colombia and Bulgaria (both sexes).69 In contrast to the 18 Global Cancer Facts & Figures 4th Edition Global Cancer Facts & Figures 4th Edition 19 wide variation in incidence trends, colorectal cancer mortality rates have been decreasing in many countries worldwide, particularly very high-HDI countries, likely due to improvements in treatment and early detection.

Most rural areas throughout the developing world have disproportionately fewer health centres and clinics, trained midwives, nurses and doctors than urban areas.	Most rural areas throughout the developing world have disproportionately fewer health centres and clinics, trained midwives, nurses and doctors than urban areas. For most rural dwellers, health treatment must be obtained from traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Most TBAs have no formal training in health practices but acquire their skills via apprenticeship. These are skills passed down through generations of women. By observing a given situation, the TBA learns which remedy to use for which illness, or how to perform different kinds of delivery. If the situation changes, they try to adapt their knowledge and remedies and hope that that works. If things go wrong, however, supernatural explanations are given; blame is never attributed to the TBA.	n
These examples illustrate how a combination of institutional management of inputs and local geography impedes some farmers' access to resources that support rice cropping and recovery of cultivation following climate hazards.	The distribution of resources from the Block level worked against small-scale farmers. The storm surge in the 1999 super cyclone increased the salinity of many coastal fields; in response the government distributed gypsum to farmers from the Block offices. However, traveling to the Block office created significant transaction costs both in terms of lost time, which could otherwise be spent earning an income, and through funding travel. For these reasons farmers were unwilling to visit the Block office or transport gypsum to their fields (interview with Block level agricultural officer). Another farmer noted that he buys seeds in the private market because the Block is too far away (SSI:17), though many farmers were accessing seeds locally through cooperatives. These examples illustrate how a combination of institutional management of inputs and local geography impedes some farmers' access to resources that support rice cropping and recovery of cultivation following climate hazards.	n

The answers may be in the product market more than in the labor market.	The key questions are why growth in Tunisia and other countries with high youth unemployment has not been more labor intensive and why the sectors that have expanded the most rely on unskilled workers. The answers may be in the product market more than in the labor market. Although many countries in the region have implemented reforms to reduce red tape and improve the overall business climate, discretion, arbitrariness, and unequal treatment still hinder competition and private sector development, especially in skills-intensive sectors such as telecommunications. In many countries in the Middle East and North Africa, connections with political power may matter more for success than entrepreneurial capacity.82 The perks often extend to the workers in these cosseted businesses, under the form of job security and other benefits, adding to the frustration of those left out.	n
As countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases.	Fifth, the dietary transformation following income growth and urbanization also opens up new demand for agricultural products and employment on, and increasingly also, offthe farm in the value chains. As countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases. After Engel's Law, this is the second large Law of Demand, named after Bennett. This also opens up new jobs opportunities, directly in the production of these products (dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables), and indirectly in the associated chains (storage, transport, processing, packaging, wholesale, and retail). The production of high-value agricultural products tends to be more labor intensive (see also Figure3.6), while jobs in the agricultural value chain (especially in agro-processing) are often taken up by women (Table 2.2). Together they add better earning and more inclusive jobs, mitigating the decline of jobs in staple crop production as increasing labor productivity in staple production releases labor (given less than unit income elasticity of demand for staples) and the structural transformation proceeds. Linking changes in dietary patterns to the employment structure in six East and Southern African countries, Tschirley et al. (2015) project that between 2010 and 2025 about one-quarter of the decline in the farm labor share (3.2 percentage points out of a decline of 13.2) will be absorbed in food preparation away from home, food manufacturing, and marketing and transport.	n
The research is guided by four main questions: 1.	The research is guided by four main questions: 1. Impact: What does the existing literature suggest about the impact of women's leadership on the humanitarian sector and humanitarian assistance, specifically in locally led humanitarian action? Particular attention was paid to documenting the effectiveness of women's leadership in humanitarian action by looking at the results of efforts made by local humanitarian actors to support gender-transformative action. Definitions of women's leadership and gender-transformative action are to follow. 2. Current Engagement: How are women and women's organizations involved in the humanitarian sector and in situations of locally led humanitarian action? 3. Barriers and Challenges: What barriers and challenges do women and women's organizations face in their participation in the humanitarian sector, and specifically in LHL? In what ways does LHL constrain, if at all, women's leadership? 4. Opportunities: Does LHL encourage women's leadership? How does this compare across the country case studies? 10 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan a. Are there opportunities for advancing women's leadership in locally led humanitarian action? If so, under what conditions? b. What enables women and women's organizations to successfully engage in the humanitarian sector and locally led humanitarian action? These questions test the extent to which women's leadership features in locally led humanitarian action, and the extent to which it needs to feature to ensure a truly transformed humanitarian system and effective response. The findings from these questions go toward the body of evidence on LHL, and specifically turn a feminist lens on LHL. The findings also help identify how women's leadership can be better incorporated into efforts to alleviate a consistent problem: the patriarchal humanitarian system's inadequate response to women's gender-based needs and disregard for women's agency. This report presents exploratory research on an understudied area that can be used to develop robust research questions and hypotheses in the future.	n
Gender-based occupational segregation also reflects the difference between women and men in terms of their choice of education and vocational training (see Chapter 2 on Education).	Women and men tend to work in different occupations (horizontal segregation) and in different positions within the same occupation or occupational group (vertical segregation). The segregation of women and men in different occupations is closely associated with gender roles or stereotypes about women (for example, that they are caring or home-based). Gender-based occupational segregation also reflects the difference between women and men in terms of their choice of education and vocational training (see Chapter 2 on Education). Occupational segregation can negatively affect the flexibility of the labour market30 and the economy as a whole. It also has direct negative effects on women in particular, partly because women's employment is concentrated in a more limited number of occupations than that of men.31 Such concentration imposes more restrictions on women than on men in terms of what types of jobs they can undertake. Occupational segregation, both horizontal and vertical, also contributes greatly to the pay differentials between women and men (see section in this chapter on the gender pay gap). 30 Segregation causes labour market inflexibility because it constrains mobility between male and female occupations. When a firm needs a large group of new workers for an industry that is clearly male-or female-dominated, it may not find a sufficient number of qualified candidates for the posts. Source: Melkas and Anker, 1997. 31 A study covering 41 countries showed that there are seven times more male-dominated occupations than female-dominated occupations--defined as an occupation in which either men or women, respectively, comprise at least 80 per cent of workers.

Both formal and informal workplaces can play a key role in enabling women's access to antenatal health care.	During pregnancy and breastfeeding, there may be risks at the workplace that could affect the health of the woman and her child. Many countries include provisions in their legislation to protect pregnant or nursing women from work-related risks, including requiring Executive summary Maternity and paternity at work xv risk assessments or specifying dangerous substances or conditions that must be avoided. In 49per cent of the 160countries assessed there exist provisions prohibiting employers from employing pregnant or nursing women in dangerous work, and another 21per cent of countries stipulate that these workers are not obliged to perform dangerous work. If a significant risk exists at the workplace, legislation often requires that employers take protective measures to address those risks by transferring a woman to other safe tasks or allowing her to take leave early. Of the 160countries with information, 84provide some sort of alternative to dangerous work while 76do not. In addition, 116out of 156countries (74per cent) do not provide for time off work for prenatal health care. This type of leave is particularly uncommon in low-income countries, where only 39 per cent of pregnant women received the WHO recommended minimum four antenatal health visits in 2008. Both formal and informal workplaces can play a key role in enabling women's access to antenatal health care.	n

These groups also state that having to work is another common reason why they cannot attend school.

The Management Entity has hosted workshops, conferences, and training sessions for the Principal Investigators and collaborating scientists. These activities have served to increase international technology transfer and impart new skills to participants. Host country collaborating scientists have variable relationships with their country's extension/technology transfer organizations. In some cases, the host country's system to disseminate new technology is well developed and effective, whereas in other countries there is little interaction between collaborators and extension/outreach agencies. A summary of host country collaborating scientists' involvement in technology transfer is given in Attachment 2.	n

"As we approach global ecological limits that define a ""safe operating space"" for humanity3, it is 3 United Nations, 2012."	"The second part of the chapter examines the participation of women and men in preserving the environment through everyday activities and environmental decision-making in local and highlevel forums. Available data show that in everyday life, women tend to recycle and cut back on driving to reduce pollution more than men (linked to the gender division of domestic work), but remain underrepresented in local and national positions of decision-making related to the environment.

Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is an important first step in identifying priorities.	Step one: What are good jobs for development? Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is an important first step in identifying priorities. The nature of the jobs with the greatest payoffs varies with the characteristics of the country, including its phase of development, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges differ in agrarian economies, conflict-affected countries, resource-rich countries, and countries with high youth unemployment, as well as in other settings. And the jobs with the greatest development impact differ as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas.	n

Genuine community engagement v Health system actors have successfully engaged recognised local authorities, leaders, and influencers, including women leaders, to enhance the community uptake of culturally appropriate preventive community and individual health and hygiene practices in line with national public health recommendations (c) Maintains 5 opinion as to whether this weakened or strengthened national coordination. In Kenya, the National Emergency Response Committee, a highly centralised body accessible only by top government officials, has public health in an advisory role only, and there are disconnects between national and county levels. Pakistan's leadership has been disjointed, with different approaches being advocated by the federal government, provincial governments, military actors, and religious leaders. Leadership of women in the response is low - in Kenya, Pakistan, and Uganda, women make up 29%, 8%, and 22.5% of key response committees respectively, often with men holding the most influential positions. Thus, these committees are less likely to consider women's and men's different experiences when shaping responses, which is expected to deepen gender inequality.	n

This is the case for poverty, access to education, use of the Internet, and physical violence.	In a couple of areas, the evidence does not seem to indicate a further disadvantage of women with disabilities relative to men with disabilities, suggesting that attitudinal and environmental barriers against disability, not gender, are the major factors driving the disadvantage experienced by women with disabilities. This is the case for poverty, access to education, use of the Internet, and physical violence. However, for access to employment and sexual violence, barriers against both gender and disability seem to play a role.	n

Comprehensive and intensive programmes of formal and informal education, awareness raising and training are the approach followed by some Governments, non-governmental organizations and women's groups. In part II.C above, reference was made to the various ways in which women's organizations are trying to empower women and service providers in an effort to change attitudes regarding harmful traditional practices. This approach needs to be supported by implementation of national and international human rights norms relating to the elimination of discrimination against women. The environment of discrimination, which denies women and the girl child equal access to health care, education, employment and wealth, must also be addressed and reformed.	n

Use of non-family labor is especially high on cotton, rice, and cashew (grown in the north), the production of which has been expanding over the past 5 years.	Export crops make up about a quarter of total agricultural output, with food crops making up the rest (75 percent). There is a fair degree of market orientation in agriculture in Coted'Ivoire. Four in five smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in five reporting that they sell their complete harvest. Farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively well endowed with land. Given high land/labor ratios and little mechanization, hiring labor is common, often migrant labor to make up for family labor shortages.

When women attend school, they also have better chances of finding work and shaping their own lives.	There are two central points for intervention. And both make lives better. One of the greatest opportunities to increase human wellbeing is to slow down and eventually reverse population growth. This does not require coercive measures, in fact non-coercive ones are far more effective. And even more importantly, those investments make lives better, particularly for those who live in more fragile conditions today. Above all, this is the chance to invest in women, by giving them access to schooling, but also to family planning. This helps women to be more in control of their lives, and to contribute more effectively, for instance as community leaders or entrepreneurs. In many poorer parts of Africa, girls are excluded due to immediate economic hardship, and as a result poverty persists. When women attend school, they also have better chances of finding work and shaping their own lives. Their quality of life increases, as does that of their children and all other members of their family, men and women. Also, families become smaller. As a result there is more capacity for everyone living on limited resources. In the global economy it is beneficial for a country to have a gradually shrinking population. Many people think the opposite is true. They believe that competitiveness increases with a growing population. In an ecologically scarce world this no longer holds true.	n
It increased awareness, capacity and the operational and technical resources to include school health and nutrition in education sector plans.	The other three grants concluded in fiscal year 2018: >> Addressing the out-of-school children data and policy gaps (World Bank, March 2014-August 2017) resulted in the production of a series of influential global studies on child marriage, the changing wealth of nations, the cost of gender inequality, disability gaps in education and the cost of not educating girls. >> Disability/health and education in support of learning for all (World Bank, August 2014-June 2018) strengthened collaboration between ministries of health and education and improved the capacity for joint planning and implementation of integrated school health and nutrition programs in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ghana and Senegal. It increased awareness, capacity and the operational and technical resources to include school health and nutrition in education sector plans. >> Addressing school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV) (UNICEF, March 2014-December 2017) gave rise to the End Gender Violence in Schools (EGVS) initiative, through which four participating countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Togo and Zambia) used evidence-based policies and strategies to reduce SRGBV.	n
Additional forms of harmful traditional practices were identified and a recommendation was made for the formation of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children.	In 1960, the issue of FGM was debated at the Seminar on the Participation of Women in Public Life, held at Addis Ababa for the African region. Concluding remarks included a call to WHO to make a statement condemning all forms of medicalization of FGM. In its resolution 821 II (XXXII), adopted in July 1961, ECOSOC again invited WHO to study the medical aspects of operations based on customs. A seminar convened in 1979 by the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Khartoum marked a milestone in the campaign against harmful traditional practices, setting the pace and direction for international and national plans of action. Additional forms of harmful traditional practices were identified and a recommendation was made for the formation of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children. In addition, the seminar reiterated the concluding remarks made at the 1960 seminar and urged Governments to collaborate with international bodies in a concerted effort to eliminate these practices.	n
Further, as evidenced by the recommendations of the United Nations High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, there is increasing recognition of the potential of the health sector to create qualified employment opportunities, in particular for women, contributing to the job creation and economic development agenda (3).

Different countries face different jobs challenges, but two forces--the migration of people and the migration of jobs--connect their jobs agendas.	Different countries face different jobs challenges, but two forces--the migration of people and the migration of jobs--connect their jobs agendas. These two flows have an impact on countries at the sending and the receiving ends. The arrival of migrants or the outsourcing of jobs affects the living standards of both migrants and locals. The availability of foreign workers, the development of migrant networks channeling savings and ideas, and the arrival of multinational firms bringing in more advanced techniques, are all bound to increase productivity. Family structures and community life are also affected by the movement of people and jobs.	n
If a household sells fruit it reduces the odds that rice cropping took two or more years to recover after the 2008 floods (p < 0.1; Table 4).	Impact of climate hazards on rice cropping The majority of the rice farmers surveyed experienced either total crop loss or crop losses greater than 50% during the 2008 floods (Fig. 2a), and during cyclone Phailin in 2013 (Fig. 2b). The sensitivity of rice farmers to crop losses is corroborated by Government of Odisha statistics[6]. Within our sample, 56% of households took two years or more to recover rice cropping to pre-2008 flood levels indicating the longer term damage to rice farming following climate hazards. If a household sells fruit it reduces the odds that rice cropping took two or more years to recover after the 2008 floods (p < 0.1; Table 4).	n

Less calorie-intensive foods, such as tomatoes, chili peppers, cacao, peanuts, and pineapples were also introduced, and are now culinary centerpieces in many Old World countries, namely Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries (tomatoes), India and Korea (chili peppers), Hungary (paprika, made from chili peppers), and Malaysia and Thailand (chili peppers, peanuts, and pineapples).	T he Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of diseases, ideas, food crops, and populations between the New World and the Old World following the voyage to the Americas by Christo pher Columbus in 1492. The Old World--by which we mean not just Europe, but the entire Eastern Hemisphere--gained from the Columbian Exchange in a number of ways. Discoveries of new supplies of metals are perhaps the best known. But the Old World also gained new staple crops, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava.

Tobacco, another New World crop, was so universally adopted that it came to be used as a substitute for currency in many parts of the world. The exchange also drastically increased the availability of many Old World crops, such as sugar and coffee, which were particularly well-suited for the soils of the New World. The exchange not only brought gains, but also losses. European contact enabled the transmission of diseases to previously isolated communities, which .	n

In the last quarter of 2019, the price of commonly consumed foods such as cassava and maize has been rising steeply, while some cereals were no longer available in several markets.	In the lean season of May-August 2020, 2.1 million people are projected to need food assistance, including 675,000 people who will be at emergency levels of food insecurity. This is partly a result of rising commodity prices. In the last quarter of 2019, the price of commonly consumed foods such as cassava and maize has been rising steeply, while some cereals were no longer available in several markets. In addition, the unavailability of essential services has significantly contributed to the resurgence of epidemics that had previously been eradicated, putting more people at risk.	n
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights documented the different forms of discrimination faced by Indigenous women in the Americas and highlighted how their political, social and economic marginalization contributed to permanent structural discrimination, leaving them at increased risk of violence.	Indigenous Peoples continued to be criminalized and discriminated against in Argentina, where the authorities used legal proceedings to harass them; there were reports of police attacks, including beatings and intimidation. Rafael Nahuel of the Mapuche community was killed in November during an eviction conducted by security forces. In Colombia, a wave of killings of Indigenous people from communities historically affected by the armed conflict highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of the peace agreement. The killing of Gerson Acosta - leader of the Kite Kiwe Indigenous council in Timbio, Cauca, who was shot repeatedly while leaving a community meeting - was a tragic example of the ineffectiveness of the authorities' measures to safeguard the lives and safety of community leaders and other Indigenous people. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights documented the different forms of discrimination faced by Indigenous women in the Americas and highlighted how their political, social and economic marginalization contributed to permanent structural discrimination, leaving them at increased risk of violence.	n

This section presents the international normative framework on disability and education and addresses the challenges persons with disabilities face in accessing education on the basis of available evidence.	D. Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all persons with disabilities (Goal 4) This section focuses on the realization of Goal 4 for persons with disabilities. Goal 4 calls for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting life-long learning opportunities for all. While all targets of Goal 4 are crucial in achieving equal education for persons with disabilities, only two targets explicitly mention disability, namely target 4.5 which aims inter alia at ensuring equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities; and target 4.a that calls for building and upgrading education facilities that are disability sensitive and providing inclusive learning environments for all. This section presents the international normative framework on disability and education and addresses the challenges persons with disabilities face in accessing education on the basis of available evidence. It also discusses current practices in countries regarding access to education of persons with disabilities and presents examples of national policies and best practices as well as recommendations to advance inclusive education.	n

Effective health workforce strategies include the education and deployment of a diverse and sustainable skills mix, harnessing in some contexts the potential of community health workers (CHWs) operating in interprofessional primary care teams. However, the support for CHWs and their integration into health systems and communities are uneven across and within countries; good-practice examples are not necessarily replicated and policy options for which there is greater evidence of effectiveness are not uniformly adopted. Conversely, successful delivery of services through CHWs requires evidence-based models for education, deployment and management of these health workers.	n

Mixed farming systems with divergent production cycles (crops and livestock) can also help. The cost of market access can equally be reduced. Solutions to underemployment in agriculture are thus not confined to nonagricultural activities, but can equally be found in agriculture, on and offthe farm. Also, with agricultural underemployment less pronounced in Coted'Ivoire, especially measures that that increase output per hour worked will be needed.

Differing incentives: In Uganda, farmers are interested in collaborating with Peanut CRSP to reduce aflatoxin levels in peanut since they are the principal consumers of their produced.	Institutional problems: Some problems were encountered in identifying scientists to carry out collaborative research in Senegal, which resulted in very slow progress in two years. This necessitated transfer of the project to Uganda in 2003, with Makerere University as the collaborating institution. Considerable progress has been attained in one year and the collaborating scientists remain very active and committed. Differing incentives: In Uganda, farmers are interested in collaborating with Peanut CRSP to reduce aflatoxin levels in peanut since they are the principal consumers of their produced. However, there is no incentive among traders to do the same. It is planned to work with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture to create greater awareness of the health risks of aflatoxin and availability of Peanut CRSP technologies to reduce contamination, such as manual sorting. The project has also to work with the Ministry of Trade in this respect.	n

Gender parity in learning outcomes exhibit significant variance from country to country, with girls or boys scoring higher in math or reading or both.	The most effective way to improve overall outcomes is to focus on those who are particularly disadvantaged, and there are sizable disparities by wealth and location, with only about two-thirds as many children from the poorest families attaining minimum proficiency levels in math or reading by the end of primary school as did children from the richest families. Gender parity in learning outcomes exhibit significant variance from country to country, with girls or boys scoring higher in math or reading or both. In addition, too many schools are not imparting the basics. Across 10 countries, 45 percent of the schools were underperforming, with less than 20 percent of their students achieving minimum proficiency level. In Chad and Niger, more than 80 percent of schools are underperforming on learning outcomes, compared with only 1 percent in Burundi.	n

This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.	On-farm and off-farm activities can be complementary in assisting households to manage risk. In other contexts off-farm income has been important in helping small-scale farmers cope with shocks in India (Gaurav 2015), Mozambique (Cunguara et al. 2011), and South America (Bebbington 1999). In Odisha, vulnerable farming communities are characterized by dependence Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ on subsistence rice farming and limited off-farm opportunities (Panda 2016). In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined. This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.	n
"The WHO defined health, in its 1948 Constitution, as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity""."	"Box 2. What is health and well-being? The WHO defined health, in its 1948 Constitution, as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"". The definition made the point that health has social as well as physical and psychological dimensions and suggested that the ultimate goal is not just better health but also increased well-being. Health does not equate with well-being, but health is both an intrinsic component of well-being and a determinant of well-being."	n
Much of this increase has come in Heilongjiang and the other two northeastern provinces of Jilin and Liaoning, but production has also expanded noticeably in Henan and Shandong.	China is the world's largest rice producer, accounting for 32-35% of total world production (India has a larger rice area harvested, but lower per hectare yields). Except for Japan and the Republic of Korea, rice yields in China are the highest in Asia, due in part to favorable growing conditions. Rice area harvested has declined from its peak of 37 million hectares in the mid-1970s to just over 30 million ha today. The decline in area has been due to both economic reforms that reduced government requirements to grow rice and economic development that increased the opportunity cost of land. In recent years, much of the fall in rice area has occurred in coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang. Hunan is the largest rice producing province, and most rice production is in the Yangtze River Valley (or further south) where ample supplies of water are available. However, rice production in northern China has increased substantially in recent years, with its share of national production nearly doubling from 7.6% in 1989 to 13.3% in 1999. Much of this increase has come in Heilongjiang and the other two northeastern provinces of Jilin and Liaoning, but production has also expanded noticeably in Henan and Shandong.	n
Basic education is compulsory for all children.	Country Notes School education is divided into three levels: primary (4 years), basic (9 years) and secondary (11 years).

It all started in only one school.	The main challenges are related to (self) organization, in time and effort, caused by the unexpected current pandemic situation that has forced us to work from home. It is more demanding to follow (and succeed in) an online course, compared to face-toface course. And the risk of drop-out is much bigger too than in face-to-face courses. Continuous assistance and mentoring are the key to fight these challenges. Partnership would be most welcome to explore one aspect of the project in which an IT specialist is needed, i.e. data science, artificial intelligence, and semantic scholarship. Funding could allow us to hire specific services (e.g. administrative support), and/or to provide for scholarships (e.g. research scholarship). Other types of partnerships are envisioned for instance with political/official stakeholders in education. A strong innovating social entrepreneurship spirit has kept the project self-sustained. The principles of open access and open science we have been following are aligned with the Portuguese national strategy for digital skills (Portugal INCoDe.2030) and, at an international level, particularly with the SDG 4. It all started in only one school. In this school year we have been working with 6 schools. We were reaching only the district of Lisboa, and now we are also reaching the district of Santarem. In the near future, we expect to further replicate the project (e.g. in the United Republic of Tanzania), aiming at continuing to foster the development of digital skills and competences, including ICT and informational, on an individual or global-society scale, ultimately where most needed in close alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.	n

Should she be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker?	"Work matters and words matter The varied interpretations capture the different aspects of jobs that people value. A woman in Hanoi, Vietnam, explained, ""an old woman who just sells vegetables can gain respect from others and people listen to her.""68 A man who had worked his way out of poverty in Satgailijhara, Bangladesh, linked the value of his job as a rice farmer to being able to invest in his children, ""I have been able to get my children educated. That's the best achievement in life.""69 Ela Bhatt, a lawyer and the founder of Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India, described her struggle with the language of work, given the multiplicity of tasks that people do every day and over time: ""A small farmer works on her own farm. In tough times, she also works on other farms as a laborer. When the agriculture season is over, she goes to the forest to collect gum and other forest produce. Year round, she produces embroidered items either at a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader who comes to her village to buy goods. Now, how should her trade be categorized? Does she belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sector, or the home-based work sector? Should she be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker?""70 These questions are not merely semantic. The words and categories that are used to describe work have tangible implications. Views on what a job is and what it means almost inevitably influence views on what policies for jobs should look like. Those for whom the word job is associated with the image of a worker in an office or a factory, with an employer and a paycheck, may focus on a supportive investment climate for firms. Those for whom the word also encompasses farming, street vending, waste picking, and domestic employment may think of jobs policies as including land reform, agricultural extension, urban policies, or the provision of voice to the most vulnerable workers."	n
Firms by size in 1987, % QUESTION 3 Self-employment is prevalent in developing countries, and micro-and small enterprises are a major source of livelihood for low-skilled workers.	Firms by size in 1987, % QUESTION 3 Self-employment is prevalent in developing countries, and micro-and small enterprises are a major source of livelihood for low-skilled workers. Even if only a small fraction of these tiny economic units succeeded in building a viable business, with the potential to hire others, the aggregate effect on living standards would be substantial. Their success would also matter for productivity reasons. Quite a few currently large enterprises in industrial countries started out as micro-and small family businesses. By contrast, in developing countries many large enterprises are born large, often the result of government support or privileged access to finance and information. Breaking privileges is one more reason why the success of microenterprises is so important.	n

Millions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year.	Millions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year. Disruptions such as cyclones, floods and wildfires destroy homes and assets, and contribute to the displacement of people. Slow-onset processes - such as sea-level rise changes in rainfall patterns and droughts - contribute to pressures on livelihoods, and access to food and water, that can contribute to decisions to move away in search of more tenable living conditions. Advances in meteorological and other sciences which inform about the dynamics and pace of climate change indicate that disruptions ranging from extreme weather events to large scale changes in ecosystems are occurring at a pace and intensity unlike any other known period of time on Earth.2 Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increasingly affect migration and other forms of people moving to manage these changing risks.3 This chapter provides an up-to-date overview of environmental change and the spectrum of human mobility. It first explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration, ranging from the view that human mobility including migration is a security issue, that it is an issue of protection, and that it is a matter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change. The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world. It then summarizes recent developments in the international policy sphere on the topic. The conclusion draws out the implications for research, policy and practice.	n
This migration, along with the transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and higher living standards.	These criteria are not mutually exclusive. Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo are both resource rich and conflict affected; Jordan and Armenia are formalizing and also have high youth unemployment. Still, looking through the jobs lens and focusing on the key features of the different country types can help identify more clearly the kinds of jobs 20 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 computer and information services, legal and technical support, and other business services. India was the pioneer, but other countries--Brazil, Chile, China, and Malaysia, to name a few--have also seized the opportunity.72 The obvious winners of job migration are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered service jobs have migrated. This migration, along with the transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and higher living standards. The hidden winners of job migration are consumers worldwide. The improved international division of labor increases the availability of goods and services and enhances the possibility of gaining from trade. The clear losers are those who have seen their jobs disappear because of the declining competitiveness of their industries and services. Among the losers, many skilled workers find comparable jobs without a substantial loss in salary, but oth- and expertise. Social effects are more mixed. On the positive side, migration connects people from different cultures in ways bound to widen their horizons. On the negative side, the separation from family and friends can be a source of distress and isolation. Migration may also bring racial prejudice and heighten social tensions in host countries, especially when migrants are secluded in segregated occupations or neighborhoods, preventing their integration in society.	n

The partners in Thailand, under the leadership of Kasetsart University scientists, have developed an excellent cadre of trainers who have good technical knowledge and training skills.	The partners in Thailand, under the leadership of Kasetsart University scientists, have developed an excellent cadre of trainers who have good technical knowledge and training skills. They have developed team-work with local agricultural extension workers and farmers' and women's associations at the village-level to showcase the benefits derived from the adoption of Peanut CRSP technologies. The study tour portion of the training courses exposed the participants to actual field situations, including the constraints met by villages in developing their enterprise, and how these were solved. The active involvement of extension workers and beneficiaries brought about a new dimension to training and technology transfer activities. The outputs went beyond research reports and papers. The project facilitated the production of extension materials such as brochures, leaflets, and posters, and the development of a Peanut CRSP website at KAPI in Kasetsart University, for general public access to peanut technology and training information. There has been significant leveraging of funds from the Thai government, which has been fully committed to the successful implementation of the project since Phase 1. The Thai Princess's Royal Project has supported several poor, isolated villages that are now producing clean and healthy products that are generating cash for the family. Other donors who have provided funds for training like USAID and FAO. Opportunity for accessing training funds from Thai AID and the Ministry of Industry is being pursued by Kasetsart University to ensure sustainability of funding in the future. The Host Country Project Investigators indicated that the continued support of Peanut CRSP would allow them to continue to generate government funds for training.	n
The program provides incentives to households to offset the cost of keeping girls in school and cash grants to schools to improve the learning environment, thereby enhancing learning outcomes for girls.	International actors also have a role to play. Since 2013, the United Kingdom, through a program called Girls Education South Sudan (GESS), committed to provide pound60 million over six years to transform opportunities for a generation of girls in South Sudan through education. The program provides incentives to households to offset the cost of keeping girls in school and cash grants to schools to improve the learning environment, thereby enhancing learning outcomes for girls. This program aims to shape the future women leaders of South Sudan. A project by CARE helped women-led organizations, like Hope Restoration South Sudan, participate in the UNHCR consultation meeting on localization of interventions on gender-based violence (Lindley-Jones 2018, 54).	n
For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint.	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where. This view of the world has proven to be sufficient for raising central questions and sparking the conversations that are needed to reverse current trends. ""The Ecological Footprint is one of the most important environmental concepts in currency today, with virtually unlimited educa tion al and practical implica tion s."" edward O. Wilson, Evolutionary biologist and Harvard professor emeritus Part 1 Introduction, overview, structure ."	n

Communities: Communities were able to state clearly the safe areas (above flooding) in the vicinity of the villages.	"Agencies (national and international): Many of the agencies involved in the post-emergency phase of the disaster have established contingency plans including reinstating emergency departments within the organizations; training of staff; and establishing written procedures for emergency response. Two years after the event agencies were still sensitive to issues concerning emergencies; however, as levels of funding for emergency contingency begin to wane, they may not be able to support the measures they have put into place (i.e. funding of emergency officers, regular training updates for staff). Local government: The four District Administrators interviewed during the field work were enthusiastic about the coordination and collaboration that was apparent during the post-emergency period. In northern Inhambane the coordination mechanisms still exist and the main agencies meet regularly. However, it appears that there is still much to be done to increase the capacity of the District Administrations to prepare for future disasters. The overall impression is that although the local government maybe aware of the need for contingency planning there has, to date, been little real capacity building to support the good intentions. Communities: Communities were able to state clearly the safe areas (above flooding) in the vicinity of the villages. They were also clear that they would respond to flood warnings in the future. However, in the areas covered by the fieldwork, no agency was working with the communities to carry out vulnerability assessments on which to base mitigation plans. Questions of mitigation were not raised by the communities who saw themselves as victims of the ""acts of god"" and not as active players in the prevention of future disasters. The only exception to this was found in Nova Mambone where environmental work is been carried out by the communities to prevent erosion. Chapter 11."	n

As discussed in this chapter, educational systems need to deliver high-quality basic education, as well as increase enrollment.	For newer ICTs such as mobile phones and the Internet to convey agricultural information effectively, the content and mode of delivery may need to change, but what about the users themselves? Much has been made of young people's ready adoption of newer ICTs, as well as the capacity of ICTs (newer and older) to break through barriers to the acquisition of information and skills, such as distance, the inability to read and write, or the expense of producing and disseminating audiovisual information. Much has also been made of the potential for interactive ICTs to provide agricultural recommendations tailored to an individual farmer's circumstances. Yet much depends on whether the individual user of ICTs is able to frame relevant questions based on learning acquired in good primary schools, coupled with practice in imagining states of the world other than those already experienced. As discussed in this chapter, educational systems need to deliver high-quality basic education, as well as increase enrollment. Among rural youths who lack a basic cognitive foundation on which they can build, the benefits of ICTs may be slower to emerge.	n

Ten soldiers were arrested and detained in January, accused of involvement in enforced disappearances and killings, but were not charged and remained in detention at the end of the year. In February, criminal proceedings began against nine NIA officers, including the former director, accused of murdering opposition activist Solo Sandeng in April 2016. In October, victims of human rights abuses, civil society organizations and international human rights groups formed a coalition to campaign for Yahya Jammeh and others who Amnesty International Report 2017/18 171 committed serious human rights abuses during his rule to be brought to justice. Ousmane Sonko, Minister of Interior from 2006 until he fled the country in September 2016, faced investigation in Switzerland for crimes against humanity committed during President Jammeh's rule. On 13 December, the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparation Commission (TRRC) bill to examine events during President Jammeh's rule, was passed by the National Assembly, following consultation on the bill with national and international actors. On 10 August, a Commission of Inquiry was set up to investigate Yahya Jammeh's alleged mismanagement of public finances and abuse of office. The government also froze assets believed to belong to him. A Panel on Missing Persons, a specialized police unit investigating enforced disappearances during President Jammeh's rule, was created in February. In March, the bodies of four people, possible victims of enforced disappearance, were exhumed, including that of Solo Sandeng. It is expected to submit the list of missing people to be investigated by the TRRC.	n
Strength: Thai scientists and researchers have successfully involved extension workers in their training and technology transfer activities, especially at the village-level.	Strength: Thai scientists and researchers at Kasetsart University and their development partners have become proficient trainers on post-harvest, processing, and utilization technologies with appropriate methods to suit different groups of clientele. The Thai Project Team was able to build commitment from the government and other partners so the project has trained significant numbers of village-level processors in Phase 2. Training has involved whole communities, including extension staff, which would ensure sustainability at the village-level economic activities. Strength: Thai scientists and researchers have successfully involved extension workers in their training and technology transfer activities, especially at the village-level. Extension workers have day-to-day interactions with villagers and involving them as partners would ensure sustainability of technical advisory service to farmers and processors, which the university researchers cannot provide. They have influenced the conduct of field days and preparation of extension-type media materials, such as brochures and leaflets in Thai language. These materials have facilitated information dissemination and created greater public awareness. Strength: Thailand shows examples of successful training courses for various client groups, including a strong training of trainers program. They can show to participants successful micro-and small-scale enterprises, which are operated mainly women, which are now producing improved peanut products in the local market.	n
Bosnia and Herzegovina require annual seminars, courses, expert meetings in nursing and midwifery, and on-the-job training.	Education Table C28 presents the types of nurses and educational requirements for entry into nursing programs in Eastern Europe. www.journalofnursingregulation.com 55Volume 10 * Special Issue * January 2020 Continuing Competence Most of the reporting jurisdictions require continuing education or training. Bulgaria and Greece do not have a requirement of continued competence for nurses. Russia has the most robust requirements for continued competence of the Eastern European jurisdictions. Every 5 years, all medical professionals are required to receive special training, which includes improvement of qualifications and reexamination. A certificate is issued following the examination. This certificate is the document that grants permission to continue practicing in a nursing role. This system is currently in the process of being reformed. The new procedure will require annual reexamination, as well as proof of continuing education. In addition, there are requirements regarding state of health such as regular health checks. For those who practice in pediatric care, applicants must have a lack of criminal record in specific areas. Bosnia and Herzegovina require annual seminars, courses, expert meetings in nursing and midwifery, and on-the-job training. Nurses in Estonia must have 60 hours of employer-provided training every year. The NRB in Lithuania requires at least 3 years of legal nursing practice during the past 5 years and 60 hours of mandatory advanced training during the past 5-year period or 160 hours of nursing advanced training on or after 5 years. Annual continuing professional development is mandatory in Romania. Serbian nurses must attain 168 points in order to satisfy continuing education credits--half of the total points must be derived from where the health professional is employed and the remaining half of the total points are attained via participation in external continuing education programs. Ukrainian nurses complete a continuing training requirement every 5 years.	n

Some selected thematic trends The academic literature on migration responds in part to trends in migration phenomena and policy as well as to shifts in migration-related theory and previously published literature. Normally, there is a discernible time lag between the onset of a phenomenon and the appearance of scientific literature, this owing to the time required for research and then for publishing. The literature on the Syrian refugee crisis is now beginning to appear in significant amounts, and we can expect that the literature on the United Nations' Global Compacts will start appearing in 2019. But looking back only slightly, to 2017 - 2018, we see discussions of earlier trends and phenomena, some of which we have selected here.	n
Hygiene and sanitation, as well as shelter conditions, are often inadequate.	The Government and humanitarian partners project that at least 8 million people will require humanitarian assistance in 2020. Conflict, displacement and disease outbreaks, as well as rainfall shortages in some parts of the country and flooding in others, will remain key drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. In 2020, it is estimated that 3.7 million people will continue to be chronically food insecure. In the absence of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and practices, cholera outbreaks are expected to continue to occur. Seasonal flooding is also an annual occurrence, as are invasions by desert locusts and other pests, which are likely to contribute to significant losses in crop harvest and pastures, including in Afar, Amhara, Oromia and Somali regions. The overall condition of IDPs and returnees will continue to be dire. Hygiene and sanitation, as well as shelter conditions, are often inadequate. Protection issues, including gender-based, sexual and physical violence, are areas of concern, as are family separations and psychosocial distress and trauma, and harmful practices such as child marriages. Also of concern is that some people with specific needs are unable to access life-saving services, and that some have no legal redress for lost property and livelihood because they lack documentation. For these reasons, people in need will continue to require sustained multisector humanitarian assistance, recovery and durable solutions well into 2020. An increase in conflicts and displacements remains a possibility in 2020, given the uncertainty around the national elections in May.	n

This uneven geographic coverage reflects one of the main shortcomings of migration studies - limited attention to migration dynamics beyond North America and Western Europe. It also highlights the challenges that scholars writing about the wider geography of international migration face in attempts to situate their work in relation to hegemonic perspectives about two global regions.	n

Different case studies, referring to different populations and periods (Armenians, Africans, Cambodians, Tamils) shed light on the refugee status as an individual and collective experience.	"The issue of violence and migration routes is also addressed through the refugee situation. Karen Akoka, Olivier Clochard and Albena Tcholakova in the dossier ""Recognised refugees and after? "" (33/4, 2017) question the fate of refugees once they have obtained this status. Indeed, they start from the observation that research on recognised refugees remains too rare in studies on asylum conditions in Europe. The vast majority of academic work focuses on the situation of candidates for refugee status before their application is recognised or rejected. The articles presented in this dossier examine this ""after"" time. They question the widespread image that makes refugee status a kind of outcome and invite us to question its effects in terms of social, identity and political reconfigurations.

Information was made available worldwide through various media.	The current Peanut CRSP Grant began in 1996 with program adjustments made in 2001 based on the 2000 EEP Review. The peanut CRSP uses a value-chain approach developed around five thematic or cluster areas: (1) food safety and nutrition; (2) production efficiency; (3) socioeconomics and policy; (4) Post-Harvest and utilization; and (5) information, training and technology transfer and management. Program content assured that the Title XII expectations of impact in the host (developing) countries with benefits to the United States (U.S.A.) would be achieved. Plans were developed to resolve major constraints to the host countries and U.S.A. peanut sector and to ensure that social and gender issues were addressed. This 2004-2005 review concluded that the Peanut CRSP had been highly effective in developing technologies through research in the five thematic/cluster areas, and the technologies transferred to farmers, entrepreneurs, and key stakeholders have resulted in significant impacts in the host countries and the U.S.A. The Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree training, short-term training of host country scientists, and training of peanut farmers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders was important to technology transfer and is a major impact of the program. Institutional capacity has been developed. Information was made available worldwide through various media. Web-based program and fiscal management has been efficient and costeffective.	n
In so far as documented evidence is available or the views of informants can be triangulated, the contribution of these different interventions to broader strategy objectives and key policy themes are also addressed.	Joint evaluation of support to Anti-Corruption efforts - Bangladesh 5 1.7. Limitations This visit was the first of the five countries and as such was subject to some testing of data collection approaches, described in Chapter 2. Few preparations at country level were completed before the consultant's team arrived which resulted in some delays while documents were assembled and appointments organised with senior officials, though the team did manage to meet most of the stakeholders they wished to. A visit was made to government and NGO programmes in one district outside Dhaka and the findings have been used to inform the evaluation but are not reported separately. 1.8. Report Structure The report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 describes the methodology used. Chapter 3 then looks at the country context for Bangladesh over the period. This leads to a review of the relevance of donor AC programmes in Chapter 4, where the programmes are examined against the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), together with national needs and donor policies. In so far as documented evidence is available or the views of informants can be triangulated, the contribution of these different interventions to broader strategy objectives and key policy themes are also addressed. Chapter 5 looks at how donors have managed their programmes with specific reference to M&E, coordination and alignment with national strategies. In Chapter 6, evidence about the results of the programmes is reviewed with more detailed attention to a number of specific themes. Chapter 7 examines ways in which donors have tackled problems of corruption in the primary education sector and lessons are drawn from that experience. That leads into Chapter 8 where conclusions are identified, followed by broader lessons in Chapter 9 and some recommendations to the commissioning donors in Chapter 10.	n
For this reason one focus of the exercise is on how replicable good practice is achieved, and how constraints to overcoming good practice are overcome.	The lesson learning review has analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of recovery assistance from governments, donors, and civil society following major natural disasters. Lessons learned and good practice identified through this analysis will be of use to the donor community and governments in developing more effective policies and procedures, and in crafting future disaster assistance programs. For this reason one focus of the exercise is on how replicable good practice is achieved, and how constraints to overcoming good practice are overcome. The review has been made up of country visits (Honduras and Mozambique); desk studies (Bangladesh, India, and Turkey); and community surveys (Honduras, India, and Mozambique), with a strong focus on understanding recovery-related livelihoods of the affected population, and whether these have been supported by external interventions. Countries were selected to provide a representative picture of recovery.	n

Regulation and Governance Both independent and larger agency bodies regulate the nursing profession throughout Southeast Asia. Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand are governed by an independent body, while Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam defer to their Ministry of Health bodies for nursing governance. The mandate of all Southeast Asian NRBs are public protection and/ or promotion of the profession. Myanmar and Timor-Leste lists workforce, labor, and union issues as an additional mandate, and TimorLeste additionally cites education and training as a mandate. The Indonesia and Malaysia NRBs are comprised of nurses, physicians, and/or health professionals, whereas Laos and Vietnam list the composition as public servants. Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand require that members are nurses. There are no data available for the remaining Southeast Asian NRBs. The number of members serving on each NRB is shown in Table 14. 48 Journal of Nursing Regulation The authority to require a national examination to practice is granted to most regulatory bodies in the region, with Cambodia being the lone exception. Additionally, no data is available as to whether the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains this authority. Similarly, some regulatory bodies maintain the sole authority to approve nursing schools or programs, including Brunei, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand. Others share such authority with their respective Ministries of Education, Qualification Agencies, or Higher Education Commissions, including Laos, Malaysia, and the Philippines by other branches of the government: the Ministry of Education in Vietnam. Information is not publicly available as to whether the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains the authority to approve nursing schools or programs.

The most populous countries in the world have experienced very large increases in their labor force: nearly 8 million new entrants a year in China and 7 million a year in India since the early 1990s.	Youth bulges, aging societies, and migrant nations Demographic shifts can be massive, but they do not always go in the same direction. The most populous countries in the world have experienced very large increases in their labor force: nearly 8 million new entrants a year in China and 7 million a year in India since the early 1990s. (These rates are now decelerating rapidly, particularly in China.) Many smaller countries face large relative increases, even if the absolute numbers are less astounding. In other countries, the overall population and the labor force are shrinking. For example, Ukraine's labor force is estimated to decrease by 0.75 percent annually, the equivalent of approximately 160,000 fewer people every year.15 A simple conceptual exercise illustrates the challenges raised by these dramatic demographic transitions. To keep the ratio of employment to working-age population constant, in 2020, there should be around 600 million more jobs than in .	n

Reduction in dye use by utilizing their natural colors for khakis, etc. and by using at a base to reduce the amount of dye required to create rich vibrant dyed colors in cotton textiles.	Q What's the future for colored cotton? Reduction in dye use by utilizing their natural colors for khakis, etc. and by using at a base to reduce the amount of dye required to create rich vibrant dyed colors in cotton textiles. Achievable because these cottons have tannin within the fiber which is a dye mordant. It draws dyes-both natural and chemicalinside the fiber and thus less dye of any kind is needed.	n

The project provided training materials and other costs such as transport to the village, etc.	Thai Aid, the Thai Government's Development Aid Agency, has a program to assist developing countries in the region, such as Timor-Leste, through its Thai International Cooperation Program (TICP). Thai Aid could leverage Peanut-CRSP funding and future training on peanut could be funded through the TICP Program in the other collaborating countries. Peanut CRSP scientists and the Management Entity should support the Thai Project Team to pursue this opportunity. Kasetsart University-KAPI could access the Small-and Medium Enterprises Fund from the Ministry of Industry to support training activities. The objective is to train staff from private industry for 10-15 days on processing technologies and on good industry practices. The experience in partnering with private food companies using the Industry Incubator Model, developed in the Philippines in collaboration with Peanut CRSP, would be useful for the Thai trainers involved in this project. Training of South East Asian Scientists: An international training course on Peanut Processing and -Uutilization Technologies was held in September 2003. Participants included 13 scientists (6 women and 7 men) from 9 countries: Bulgaria (2), Cambodia (2), Indonesia (1), Lao PDR (1), Malaysia (1), Mayanmar (1), Philippines (2), Thailand (2), and Timor-Leste (1). Similar topics, as the Thai nationals training, were covered, including the use of Eliza kits to detect aflatoxin in peanut. The trainees visited villages where Peanut CRSP technology transfer activities were ongoing (Nakornrachasrima and Udorn Thanee Villages, Khon Kaen), and Suwan Research Farm where peanut experiments were conducted. Exposure to actual field/village situation facilitated the learning process and allowed the participants to meet with village processors and extension workers. Participants in the international training, held in 2003, paid their own travel cost and hotel accommodation. The project provided training materials and other costs such as transport to the village, etc. This allowed the project to stretch the limited fund from Peanut CRSP.	n

Myanmar and Timor-Leste lists workforce, labor, and union issues as an additional mandate, and TimorLeste additionally cites education and training as a mandate. The Indonesia and Malaysia NRBs are comprised of nurses, physicians, and/or health professionals, whereas Laos and Vietnam list the composition as public servants. Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand require that members are nurses. There are no data available for the remaining Southeast Asian NRBs. The number of members serving on each NRB is shown in Table 14. 48 Journal of Nursing Regulation The authority to require a national examination to practice is granted to most regulatory bodies in the region, with Cambodia being the lone exception. Additionally, no data is available as to whether the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains this authority. Similarly, some regulatory bodies maintain the sole authority to approve nursing schools or programs, including Brunei, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand. Others share such authority with their respective Ministries of Education, Qualification Agencies, or Higher Education Commissions, including Laos, Malaysia, and the Philippines by other branches of the government: the Ministry of Education in Vietnam. Information is not publicly available as to whether the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains the authority to approve nursing schools or programs.

Education, banking and the judicial system were identified as less corrupt compared to other sectors.	This picture had somewhat changed by 2007. The IGS gathered data on citizens' perceptions of corruption in the various public institutions on a scale of 1 (being least corrupt) and 5 (being highly corrupt). The survey found that all public sectors are perceived to be corrupt. Respondents identified electricity, police and customs as the top three corrupt sectors, followed by income tax and roads and highways departments. Education, banking and the judicial system were identified as less corrupt compared to other sectors. It is also notable that the perception of professionals of the extent of corruption is higher than that of the general public. There are no significant differences between the urban and rural areas. Men's perception of corruption is generally higher than that of women except when dealing with the private sector (see Table A7.1.4).	n
Topics related to housing characteristics or infrastructure, such as access to improved water, use of solid fuels for cooking and access to electricity, are covered more comprehensively because supporting statistics are available for a large number of countries.	For this report, in particular, the choice of issues examined and the structure of the chapter were constrained by the current availability of data. Topics related to housing characteristics or infrastructure, such as access to improved water, use of solid fuels for cooking and access to electricity, are covered more comprehensively because supporting statistics are available for a large number of countries. These statistics have agreed international concepts and definitions and are collected in surveys and censuses on a regular basis. For example, more than 200 countries and areas have available statistics on access to improved water and improved sanitation, for at least two data points between 1990 and 2014; and 180 countries have statistics on the use of solid fuels for cooking for at least two data points.e However, more statistical information is needed on the links between gender and the environment in several areas. Time-use data are largely missing in countries from developing regions, where poor infrastructure and housing conditions, as well as natural hazards result in increased work burdens. For example, data on time spent for water or firewood collection was available for international compilation for only 14 developing countries, either from stand-alone timeuse surveys or from modules on time use attached to other household surveys. Furthermore, time-use data on national and subnational trends, which are needed to assess changes in women's and men's work burdens as a consequence of improvements in infrastructure or deterioration due to droughts, deforestation or desertification, are generally missing.	n

Measures to monitor trade in precursor chemicals and prevent their diversion into illicit channels are key components of all strategies to prevent or curb illicit manu facture of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.	"257. Measures to monitor trade in precursor chemicals and prevent their diversion into illicit channels are key components of all strategies to prevent or curb illicit manu facture of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 258. The mechanism for the monitoring of licit trade and the prevention of diversion is laid down in article 12 of the 1988 Convention, which has been complemented over the years by a series of resolutions at various levels of the international drug control system. The fundamental assumption underlying the system of international precursor control is that chemicals that can be used as drug precursors are licit commodities and that any transaction involving them is therefore presumed to be legitimate unless there is suspicion or evidence that the chemical concerned is to be used for illicit purposes. As such, ""the procurement of chemicals necessary to manufacture drugs is one of the few points ... where drug trafficking intersects with legitimate commerce. Regulation of legitimate commerce to deny traffickers the chemicals they need is one of our most valuable tools in the battle against drug criminals.""14 259. INCB has reviewed the achievements, progress and challenges of international precursor control in its annual reports on precursors.15 Over the past 25 years, since the entry into force of the 1988 Convention on 11 November 1990, States have succeeded, through the Convention and the oversight work undertaken by INCB, in substantially reducing the diversion of substances listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 Convention from international trade into illicit drug manufacture. After a quarter of a century, the 1988 Convention enjoys near universal adherence by States worldwide. Through its provisions and requirements, the Convention has served to establish, in 14 Chemical Action Task Force, Status Report for the 1992 Economic Summit (Washington, D.C., June 1992), p. 11. 15 SEE E/INCB/2011/4, E/INCB/2012/4, E/INCB/2013/4 and E/ INCB/2014/4."	n

Local customs, such as religious practices or the use of leisure time, often determine whether a product is marketable.	Buyer preferences in a foreign market may also lead you to modify your product. Local customs, such as religious practices or the use of leisure time, often determine whether a product is marketable. The sensory impression a product makes, such as taste, smell, or a visual effect, may also be a critical factor. For example, Japanese consumers tend to prefer certain kinds of packaging, leading many U.S. companies to redesign cartons and packages that are destined for the Japanese market. Body size may also be an issue. If a product is made for U.S. body types, it may not work for people of smaller statures.	n

Telecommunications allow for a better flow of information with suppliers and customers, and the internet and mobile technology facilitate the spread of new ideas.	Access to affordable and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite for firms to operate. Power shortages are the number-two constraint to firm growth and job creation mentioned by entrepreneurs the world over--and number one in low-income countries. Telecommunications allow for a better flow of information with suppliers and customers, and the internet and mobile technology facilitate the spread of new ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets, as do ports and airports.79 The way infrastructure is regulated is important as well. Inadequate pricing policies and regulations amplify the gap in needed infrastructure services. In many countries, monopolies based on political connections have led to reduced quantities of infrastructure services at higher prices and lower quality.80 Business regulation also affects the opportunities for businesses to grow and create jobs. Regulations can increase the cost of doing business, in money or in time needed to comply. Steps taken to meet requirements or to pay fees are a burden for businesses, as are delays or discretionary decisions, such as those for permits or licenses.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council of Cyprus is charged with this responsibility.	NRB Mandates NRBs in Eastern Europe have varying mandates and most include public protection except for Estonia, which is charged with promotion of the profession of nursing and workforce, labor, and union issues. Promotion of the profession is mandated in 11 of the reporting jurisdictions. Workforce, labor, and unions issues were reported as NRB mandates in Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, and Serbia. Responsibilities of the NRBs vary across this region. Promotion of other health professionals and public protection under the umbrella of the Bulgarian Association of Health Professionals in Nursing is included in Bulgaria. The NRB in Lithuania is responsible for policy making in the field of nursing and legal regulation of nursing practice. Romanian NRBs are mandated with jurisdiction regulation, surveillance of continued professional development, and recognition of quality. In Russia, the Ministry determines entry requirements to nursing professions, as well as practice in nursing professions and standards and procedures of providing care. The majority of NRBs are empowered to administer nursing laws and regulations, make decisions about scope of practice, discipline nurses, and participate in the creation of legislation. The Bulgarian Association of Health Professionals in Nursing also handles economic matters related to the Association and provides financial and logistical support. Ukraine provides consultation on nursingrelated employment in Ukraine and abroad. Additionally, the Ministry of Education or a related national accrediting agency in most countries is tasked with the responsibility of approving nursing schools/programs in the majority of nations in this region. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Russia, and Turkey, however, grant such authority to their Ministry of Health organizations.

In 2019, overall response planning and implementation was further enriched by the collaboration between community engagement and accountability initiatives and the technical work delivered through various protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) networks. Effective community outreach and sensitization on PSEA in response to Cyclone Idai in Mozambique has been attributed to early interventions at the coordination level and highlighted as an important measure in supporting capacities across the response. As a priority for the IASC through its Results Group on Accountability and Inclusion, efforts are under way to harmonize and leverage the complementarities of these critical areas of accountability in Indonesia, Myanmar, South Sudan, Ukraine and Yemen.	n
Doing Business focuses on a few specific rules relevant to the case studies analyzed.	Uses of the Doing Business data Doing Business was designed with two main types of users in mind: policy makers and researchers. It is a tool that governments can use to design sound business regulatory policies. Nevertheless, the Doing Business data are limited in scope and should be complemented with other sources of information. Doing Business focuses on a few specific rules relevant to the case studies analyzed. These rules and case studies are chosen to be illustrative of the business regulatory environment, but they do not constitute a comprehensive description of that environment. By providing a unique dataset that enables analysis aimed at better understanding the role of business 25About Doing Business regulation in economic development, Doing Business is also an important source of information for researchers.	n

"The government continued to draft and enact new laws under the guise of ""national security"" that presented serious threats to human rights. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died in custody. Activists and human rights defenders were detained, prosecuted and sentenced on the basis of vague and overbroad charges such as ""subverting state power"" and ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"". Police detained human rights defenders outside formal detention facilities, sometimes incommunicado, for long periods, which posed additional risk of torture and other illtreatment to the detainees. Controls on the internet were strengthened. Repression of religious activities outside state-sanctioned churches increased. Repression conducted under ""anti-separatism"" or ""counterterrorism"" campaigns remained particularly severe in theXinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and Tibetan-populated areas. Freedom of expression in Hong Kong came under attack as the government used vague and overbroad charges to prosecute prodemocracy activists."	n
First it is necessary to delve into the premise of the question.	Taking into account the impact of women and women's organizations in the humanitarian system, as well as the barriers and challenges they face, is it possible to understand whether LHL uniquely encourages women's leadership? First it is necessary to delve into the premise of the question. This question looks at humanitarian action explicitly labeled as LHL, as this research has made the case that women and women's organizations are and have been involved in providing humanitarian support. Additionally, LHL, which prioritizes leadership by local and national actors, is argued to be a better model of humanitarian action because such actors have the contextual knowledge to respond effectively and have the trust of and proximity to the affected communities.9 This framing would align with feminist models that argue for the importance of contextual knowledge that is deeply connected to the voices and needs of the community.	n

One workshop was held at Makerere University on health education methodologies and gender issues.	In Uganda, where women make up the majority of peanut farmers and do most of the postharvest and processing activities, the Peanut CRSP has linked with the National Association of Women in Uganda (NAWOU) and their suborganizations. NAWOU is providing access to local women's organizations to ensure that they participate in project activities implemented by the University of Ghana. Such linkages should be maintained and strengthened. The research program in Uganda is conducted by a female student from Makerere University and explored the awareness of villagers on the health effects and management of aflatoxin. The study is providing baseline data on the impact of Peanut CRSP technologies prior to education programs to change behavior, and also build socioeconomic research capacity that is much needed in this host country. Similar work should be continued in the future. One workshop was held at Makerere University on health education methodologies and gender issues.	n

The financial crisis of 2008 has reopened heated debates about the appropriate level of regulation of the financial sector and the need to balance prudence and stability with innovation and inclusion.	Access to finance provides firms with the ability to expand, to invest in new technologies, or to smooth cash flow over time.12 Financial markets also play an important role in the allocation of resources toward more productive uses.13 Transparency within the financial sector avoids resources being channeled to those with political connections or economic power, and it also supports financial inclusion. Expanded credit registries keeping track of positive as well as negative episodes in debtors' histories help people demonstrate that they are creditworthy. But regulatory oversight is needed to ensure transparency and competition in the allocation of funds. The financial crisis of 2008 has reopened heated debates about the appropriate level of regulation of the financial sector and the need to balance prudence and stability with innovation and inclusion.	n

Amnesty International Report 2017/18 Part 1:Foreword, Spotlight and Regionaloverviews 12 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 .	The Amnesty International Report 2017/18 shines a light on the state of the world's human rights during 2017. The foreword, five regional overviews and a survey of 159 countries and territories from all regions document the struggle of many people to claim their rights, and the failures of governments to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. Yet there are also glimpses of hard-won progress, demonstrating that the defence of human rights does yield positive developments. This report pays tribute to the human rights defenders who continue to fight for change, sometimes risking their own lives in the process. In a year when austerity measures and natural disasters pushed many into deeper poverty and insecurity, this year's report also shines a spotlight on economic, social and cultural rights. While every attempt is made to ensure accuracy, information may be subject to change without notice.

In Afghanistan, poppy cultivation is an important source of income for rural households.	Conflict can fundamentally disrupt jobs by destroying or damaging infrastructure and access to markets, as well as through altering incentives. In Sri Lanka, conflict in the north disrupted economic activity and created favorable conditions for the insurgency to recruit among the newly unemployed.22 Even during war, however, people work. Jobs disproportionately involve low-pay or unpaid work, such as subsistence agriculture or petty trading. Youth in rural areas in post-conflict Liberia reported working two to four jobs at a time.23 Across countries, conflict increases fe - male labor force participation, as women work to help their households cope with income shocks and to compensate for the absence of men who are fighting (box 6.2).24 In Afghanistan, female employment rates were higher in high-conflict than in low-conflict areas; in Nepal, they increased more than in high-conflict areas.25 Some jobs in conflict-affected countries may involve illegal activities that persist in the aftermath of conflict because of weak governance and lack of legal alternatives. Even if these activities are limited in scope, they may undermine the creation of good jobs for development by distorting incentives and generating rents. In Afghanistan, poppy cultivation is an important source of income for rural households.26 In Somalia, piracy creates jobs for some through the employment of speed boat crews and related land-based operations.27 In Liberia, young people in rural areas have supplemented their income by working in illegal mining, rubber tapping, and logging.28 Jobs are central to recovery in countries emerging from conflict, but the barriers to job engine for employment creation? Moreover, countries affected by conflict are often poor to begin with. Their opportunities, resources, and capacity are scarce; data for planning may simply not exist.	n
The literary rate of the population aged 7 and above is 51.8 % (Bangladesh Bureau of statists, 2011).	Bangladesh is a medium-sized country in south Asia and substantial population of Bangladesh is 14, 97, 72, 364 (Bangladesh Bureau of statistics, 2011). The literary rate of the population aged 7 and above is 51.8 % (Bangladesh Bureau of statists, 2011). Bangla is spoken by 98% of the population in Bangladesh. Two-thirds of the students in Bangladesh attend schools administered or assisted by the government. In 2005, the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education reported that there were 37,672 government primary schools in Bangladesh (Richards, 2008, p.19). Children from rural environments are significantly less enrolled for the school. Of all students initially enrolled, 25-33 percent do not complete primary school (Richards, 2008, p.19). In Bangladesh, English was introduced during British rule and still enjoys a position of dominance and prestige (Hamid, Sussex & Khan, 2009, p.284). English is taught as a compulsory subject from the first to the 12th grade and also at the tertiary level in Bangladesh.	n
The first is the use of more capital per unit of labor.	At the risk of simplifying, four main forces lie behind increases in an economy's per capita output. The first is the use of more capital per unit of labor. The second is an increase in the number of people working, relative to the total population. This happens when fertility declines and the share of adults in the total population increases; it is also happens when women shift their work from household chores to income-generating activities. The third mechanism through which output can grow is by making people themselves more productive. The acquisition of skills, also known as human capital accumulation, allows a person to do more using the same amount of capital. The fourth mechanism is technological progress, BOX 3.1 What drives economic growth? measured as changes in total factor productivity. Technological progress amounts to combining capital, labor, and skills more efficiently, while applying new knowledge.	n

For example, UNICEF was able to commence implementation of a school health program.	While it is not possible to make a definitive statement about the extent to which Mozambique's affected population has recovered, it certainly seems that there has been substantial level of recovery after the 2000 floods. The community survey found that a very positive feature of Mozambique's recovery work has been the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure. Communities have welcomed schools, health posts, water supplies, and roads. The funding available through the recovery programs made it possible not only to repair or replace existing infrastructure, usually to higher standards, but also to build new facilities where none existed before. In the areas where additional facilities were provided, they were provided in accordance with previously identified priority areas, and human and financial resources were made available to staff these new facilities. For example in Chokwe, 249 new classrooms were built in the recovery phase. In total 101 schools were rehabilitated, constructed and equipped. An additional 4,500 children were enrolled at school in the district. Opportunities were also taken within recovery work to extend ongoing programs. For example, UNICEF was able to commence implementation of a school health program. Malaria prevention activities were extended to cover the whole of Gaza province under the National Malaria Control Program (UNICEF 2000d; Cosgrave 2001). The government's PARPA identifies isolation and lack of roads as major contributing factors to rural poverty. The reconstruction of existing roads and the provision of some new roads have been welcomed by remote communities.	n

In the fifth and sixth years of secondary education pupils are offered either occupational training or higher education training.	Country Notes Primary education lasts for six years and leads to the Getuigschrift van Lager Onderwijs (Primary Education Certificate). Secondary education is provided for young people aged 12 to 18 in four branches: ASO (general), TSO (technical), KSO (artistic) and BSO (vocational), each divided into three 2-year periods. Pupils study as many subjects as possible during basic education. From the third and fourth year of secondary education, pupils can opt for a certain branch of study within ASO, TSO, KSO, or BSO. They may also follow a 7th year after the 6th TSO, KSO or BSO year, or study for a 5th year after the 4th BSO year. In the fifth and sixth years of secondary education pupils are offered either occupational training or higher education training. From age 15/16, pupils may also attend from 1 day/week to 15 weeks/year part-time secondary education, while having signed a part-time labor or apprenticeship contract. General, vocational and technical secondary education lead to the Diploma van Secundair Onderwijs.

Food aid shipments of GE commodities destined for inland east African countries, which would ordinarily enter through the Port of Mombasa, must be diverted to other ports or reformulated with non-GE commodities.	On November 21, 2012, pursuant to a Kenyan Cabinet decision and Presidential order, the Kenyan Ministry of Public Health ordered public health officials to remove from the market all foods, feed, and seeds derived from agricultural biotechnology and to ban genetically engineered (GE) food and feed imports. Despite 310 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS announcing in August 2015 that the Kenyan government would lift the import ban on GE products by October 2015, the government maintained the ban throughout 2018. Kenya's GE ban has blocked both food aid and commercial U.S. agricultural exports derived from agricultural biotechnology from Kenya. The restriction affects U.S. exports of processed and unprocessed foods and feed ingredients, such as soy, corn, and distiller dried grains. The GE import ban also affects transshipment. Food aid shipments of GE commodities destined for inland east African countries, which would ordinarily enter through the Port of Mombasa, must be diverted to other ports or reformulated with non-GE commodities. In September 2017, Kenya approved open field trials for GE cotton (MON 15985) and derived varieties, and for GE corn developed for drought tolerance and insect resistance under the Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) project. While political bottlenecks have slowed the process for dissemination and use of GE corn, the national performance trials for GE cotton began in 2018 and the first commercial cultivation could begin in fall 2019. However, it is unclear how Kenya will import sufficient GE cotton seeds for planting with the GE import ban in place. In addition to cotton, GE Gypsophila (baby's breath) intended for export to the international cut flower market, including the United States, was supposed to be commercialized in 2019 but now appears to be delayed because of uncertain market access in Europe. The U.S. Government continues to engage the Kenyan government and stakeholders to support the adoption of these technologies and address the challenges.	n
For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13).	Expenses related to cultural activities Households struggling to access food via rice farming strategies remained saddled with other income stresses. These could be large significant events such as weddings or repeat small-scale household expenditures, e.g., for medicine. Weddings presented households with substantial costs, but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor. As a result, scarce financial resources were not invested into enhancing returns from rice farming. For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13). The costs of weddings often exceeded rice farmers' financial capabilities, resulting in loan taking or sales of land. The knock-on effect is reduced investment in rice cropping, increased loan taking, or asset sales serving to reduce rice cropping households' long-term climate resilience.	n

While food is currently available, the ability to purchase has fallen drastically as incomes have plummeted, and access to food has been affected by the closure of food markets and lockdowns/curfews.	Introduction of stimulus and support packages for food production and supply Maintains countries are facing a mismatch between purchasing power-backed demand and the overall supply of food. While food is currently available, the ability to purchase has fallen drastically as incomes have plummeted, and access to food has been affected by the closure of food markets and lockdowns/curfews. Managing the mismatch will be critical for ensuring food security for all. This section will look first at production, then at the supply chain, markets, and finally at monitoring.	n

Finally, basic biological knowledge (e.g.	An assessment of the status and trends of bioinvasion in a given area is fundamental first step in the development of a national plan for dealing with IAS issues. The Plan itself should include a strategy to build institutional support and engage all important stakeholders in the effort, particularly local communities. This national strategy will be needed to make a national commitment operational. Goals and objectives for a national plan need to shared across sectors and the strategy needs to be integrated into larger national plans for conservation and agricultural development. For invasions in natural environments, the goals will ideally include the preservation or restoration of that environment; the control of a IAS is only the first step in this process. Existing legal and institutional frameworks also need to assessed and reviewed as these are key to the sustainability of any national effort to address the problems. There is also need to have concerted bilateral, regional and sometimes global actions based on common objectives. Finally, basic biological knowledge (e.g. taxonomy) must be combined with evolving technologies and tools for management. These tools rely heavily on the existence of reliable and taxonomically comprehensive data. Broadly speaking, any national plan should comprehensively address the four categories of tools and processes for IAS management: prevention, early detection, eradication, and control. The following section provides a brief summary of these issues. Detailed descriptions and case studies for the examples mentioned below can be found in the Toolkit.	n
Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid.	"ChaPTER i. ThE hEalTh aNd wElfaRE of maNkINd 5 27. One of the most serious challenges includes the loss of state control to organized criminal groups. Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State, as well as the regional and global community. When state structures become involved with and affected by violence and systemic corruption, drug trafficking can further weaken the efficacy of Governments to the point of creating ""failed State"" conditions at the national or subregional level. Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid. 28. One of the most recent challenges to the international drug control system is that posed by the use of the Internet for drug trafficking. States must do more to enable the investigation of such illegal operations in order to ensure that such operations are identified, restricted and eliminated and that the international postal system is not used for illicit drug shipments. Internet pharmacies and other dispensing methods that physically separate the prescriber or provider from the patient pose a particular risk and require the development of more effective regulatory approaches. In such systems of supply, it is more difficult for prescribers and dispensers to evaluate the needs of patients to ensure that the prescriptions will be used for legitimate medical purposes so as to protect the health and well-being of the individual. States should be mindful of the challenges that such methods for the supply of medications may pose."	n

Some farmers have started producing rice through organic farming to meet this demand.	In spite of substantial farm subsidies and price support provided by the government, rice farming cannot compete with other economic activities, and income from it is lower than nonagricultural earnings. Farming operations have been fully mechanized. Nearly all rice seedlings are transplanted using mechanical transplanters. Despite this mechanization, production costs are many times higher than in tropical Asia because of exorbitant land prices and the high opportunity cost of farm labor. Young people are not interested in rice cultivation, which today is carried out mainly by older people. Many Japanese consumers now want environment-friendly rice grown without heavy use of agrochemicals. Some farmers have started producing rice through organic farming to meet this demand.	n
It also discusses challenges in the alignment of grants to education systems and wider efforts to advocate for more and better financing for education.	Financing and partnership Mobilizing more and better financing for education is a key strategic objective of GPE 2020, as is building a stronger partnership. According to the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, an additional US$44 billion each year would need to be mobilized from international financing to fill the gap for all low-and middle-income countries to achieve universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education.1 However, more financing is not the only challenge: External financing should be allocated to the countries with the greatest education need, and used to support those interventions directly associated with learning for all children. This chapter presents an overview of the GPE grant portfolio,2 using the most recent data to examine where GPE funding goes, and the performance of GPE grants.

While this group may adopt their own cultural standards and priorities, their insistence on others has inevitably resulted in the Platform for Action being accompanied by a number of reservations.	We hope that this statement and these reservations will be included in the official report of the Conference. 21.

My delegation is gratified to join the international community in expressing our commitment to the Platform, especially on those provisions dealing with poverty, education, health, the elimination of violence against women in civil and armed conflicts, and the active participation of women in decision-making and economic development for their advancement and empowerment. However, we cannot help noting a number of differences among delegations arising from the stand on certain issues by one group of countries. While this group may adopt their own cultural standards and priorities, their insistence on others has inevitably resulted in the Platform for Action being accompanied by a number of reservations.	n
In addition to the classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists.	"The European Review of International Migration (REMI) is a specialised journal on international migration and inter-ethnic relations. Multidisciplinary (sociology, anthropology, demography, geography, history, political science, etc.), it publishes in French, English and Spanish in-depth articles of empirical or theoretical orientation, as well as research notes that present the first results of ongoing research. Each review number includes a thematic issue which is supplemented by varia. A legal chronical since 2016 takes into account the growing importance of legal issues related to international migration and migration policy issues. This reborn chronical is moderated by a group of specialised lawyers who are developing a network around issues such as international migration law (conventions, protocols), reception and protection conditions for unaccompanied minors, protection and promotion of the social rights of migrants, human rights as protection of migrants' rights, access to health, labour law for irregular migrants. 25 Articles cited in the journal editors' contribution can be found at: https://journals.openedition.org/remi/. 339WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 REMI celebrated its 30th anniversary by publishing a special issue entitled ""Renewing the Migration Issues"" (32/3-4 2016). This special volume brought together original and diversified contributions. In addition to the classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists. Through these exchanges, the function of scientific journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use of categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place of migration in multicultural societies are examined. Other articles deal with epistemological challenges by reporting on survey methods in an urban context (use of photography, sound recordings), the measurement of migratory flows, the mapping of migratory flows, the museography of migratory histories. Other articles analyse more current and topical situations: the United States' migration policy and the revival of the ""Silk Road"" between Asia and Europe."	n

"Nurses throughout the world have numerous responsibilities and it is beyond the extent of this report to detail all the nursing activities that are performed throughout the world. We did, however, explore which nurses have expanded responsibilities that encompass three areas: diagnosis, prescribing, and referrals to another practitioner. Although researchers in many jurisdictions were unable to gather these data, it was possible to determine that at least 52% (n = 167) of jurisdictions around the world allow nurses to prescribe medications or other types of treatment to some degree. In 37% (n = 117) of these jurisdictions, there is at least one nursing role with unrestricted prescribing authority. Similarly, 51% (n = 165) of jurisdictions allow diagnoses to be made by at least one type of nurse, although in many cases, these jurisdictions place restrictions on the type of diagnoses the authorized nurse may provide. Worldwide, 21% (n = 67) of jurisdictions permit RNs to diagnose, though often with limitations (Table 2). A ""nursing diagnosis,"" which is an evidence-based clinical judgment that allows a nurse to develop a care plan and select nursing interventions, is codified in at least 5% (n = 17) of jurisdictions.27 ."	n

Environmental Sustainability (10 indicators): The importance of the natural environment for providing an attractive location for tourism cannot be overstated, so policies and factors enhancing environmental sustainability are an important competitive advantage in ensuring a country's future attractiveness as a destination. This pillar consists of policy indicators such as the stringency and enforcement of the government's environmental regulations and variables assessing the status of water, forest resources and marine life, proxied by fish stock status. Given the environmental impacts of tourism itself, we also take into account the extent to which the T&T industry is developed in a sustainable manner.	n

Note that this indicator is not intended as a formal count; it is only a proxy for the actual number of children reached by GPE. Specifically, depending on how a given GPE grant is used by a country and the nature of country-level projects implemented, its impact may affect more or less children than estimated by the indicator. 36. Girls make up less than half of the estimated children supported because these estimates are based on the children being served by the education systems across DCPs, and girls are still on average less likely to have access to education, so they are less likely to be beneficiaries.

As lifetime experience is affected by years exposed to violence, looking at experience in the past 12 months reveals that recent experience of violence declines with age also.	Proportion of women who experienced physical and/or sexual violence in the 12 months before the survey, by type of perpetrator, European Union-average, 2012 Age group Partner violence (%) Non-partner violence (%) 18-29 6 9 30-44 5 5 45-59 4 3 60+ 3 3 Based on data from the Italian Violence Against Women survey conducted in 2006, it can be seen that lifetime experience of violence (partner and non-partner, physical or sexual) was higher among women aged between 25 and 34 years (38 per cent) and 35 and 44 years (35 per cent) than among women aged 55 to 64 years (26 per cent) and 65 to 70 years (20 per cent). As lifetime experience is affected by years exposed to violence, looking at experience in the past 12 months reveals that recent experience of violence declines with age also. Prevalence of violence in the past 12 months was 16 per cent for women aged between 16 and 24 years and less than 1 per cent for women aged between 65 and 70 years.a Many surveys conducted in developing countries do not include older women in their sample. However, results from the few that do show that the experience of violence tends to decline as women age. In Fiji,b results show that younger women are much more at risk of experiencing intimate partner violence in the previous 12 months than older women. In that country, the prevalence of intimate partner violence of a physical nature in the past 12 months declined from 40 per cent in the 18-to 24-year-old age group to 3 per cent in the 55-to 64-year-old age group. A similar pattern was observed for intimate partner sexual violence. In Morocco, the experience of intimate partner physical violence in the past 12 months peaked between the ages of 30 and 34 and then declined, with prevalence halving from 6 per cent in the 40-to 49-year-old age group to 3 per cent in the 50-to 64-year-old age group.c Source: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Violence against Women: An EUwide Survey, 2014.

Approximately 37.5 percent have no education and 17.5 percent have not completed primary school.	In light of the historical enrollment patterns, educational attainment remains modest among the youth of working age in Coted'Ivoire. According to the national employment survey collected in February 2014, over 50 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 34 lack a complete primary education. Approximately 37.5 percent have no education and 17.5 percent have not completed primary school. This reflects the low primary enrollment rates over the last 30 years --for example, in the early 1990s gross enrollment was below 70 percent. So while enrollment rates have improved, there is still a deficit of human capital in the current working-age population, even among those in the younger cohorts. Recent improvements in enrollment will benefit the next generations of youths entering the working-age population, and the overall education profile of the working-age population will take time to change substantially.	n

Hall and Jones (1998) and Barro and Lee (2001)).	All of the countries considered in this study, with the exception of India, are projected by the UN to see a declining share of their total populations in the prime 15-59 working age group between 2014 and 2050. This is the counterpart of the fact that all 24 countries (including India) are projected to see a rising share of their populations aged 60 or over. Korea, Spain, Russia, Japan, Italy and China are expected to see the largest declines in the share of the prime working age group over the period to 2050. Significant ageing effects are 31 The model goes back to the Nobel Prize-winning work of Solow (1956, 1957), which has remained the standard academic approach ever since the late 1950s and was later applied empirically by Denison (1985) and many others. A well-known more recent example of a research study on this topic is D. Wilson and R.Purushothaman, 'Dreaming With BRICs: The Path to 2050', Goldman Sachs, Global Economics Paper No:99, October 2003. This applies a similar growth modelling approach to four leading emerging market economies, except that it does not explicitly include human capital in its calculations. Given the importance of this factor, we prefer to make our assumptions on this variable explicit, as in many earlier academic studies (e.g. Hall and Jones (1998) and Barro and Lee (2001)). 32 More formally, we assume a Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to scale.	n

The availability of commercial flights. --Personal considerations or preferences are not factors that impact on whether a person is practically restricted in traveling. Once there is no practical restriction on travel, then deciding to remain in New Zealand does not prevent days from being counted for the residence day tests. It does not matter whether they decide to stay in New Zealand because of the level of Covid-19 infection in their home country, or for other reasons. This includes wanting to go to a different country where entry restrictions still exist. Choosing to stay in New Zealand results in the person becoming tax resident under the ordinary application of the day tests. --New Zealand resident student loan borrowers stranded outside New Zealand for more than 183 days in a twelve-month period will not be subject to interest on student loans where the threshold was breached because of travel restrictions. --While the guidance provides some welcome concessions for individuals and their employers, it does not provide an automatic exclusion from tax simply because Covid-19 may have had some impact on travel plans. Therefore, it is important that individuals and their employers consider their tax positions carefully in New Zealand. --For those who have taken up a new role during the Covid-19 lockdown period and who are now working for an offshore employer from New Zealand, PAYE and other employer taxes obligations will need to be considered.

Exhibitions have played a major role in bringing some rural products to a wider market, especially furniture, and have attracted better contracts that have led to modest job creation.	PROMER helped to create 240 enterprises, consolidate 665 enterprises, create 3,750 jobs, and teach 458 people to read. It usually takes enterprises 3 to 5 years to reach their full potential, and finding a niche in the economy can be critical for success. Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries. Apprentices trained informally by the baker opened 20 enterprises of their own and created about 84 jobs. Other rural enterprises were not as successful. Some developed products that succeeded in rural markets but not in urban markets because of high transport costs, poor marketing, or poor quality. Most entrepreneurs reported challenges in maintaining quality and continuous production. Rural enterprises had trouble finding an urban location in which to present their products, a result that highlights the problem of multiple constraints. Exhibitions have played a major role in bringing some rural products to a wider market, especially furniture, and have attracted better contracts that have led to modest job creation.	n

The greater constraint is a shortage of labor during peak periods, especially in the central region where industrial employment is higher than in the other rice-producing regions. Mechanization of agricultural operations is almost complete and combine harvesters are widely used. The price of rice fell sharply after the devaluation of the currency in 1997.

The large share of employment in nonagricultural household enterprises is often overlooked.	Nonagricultural self-employment in household enterprises accounts for 29.7 percent of employment in Coted'Ivoire. The large share of employment in nonagricultural household enterprises is often overlooked. Yet individual microenterprises are a key source of employment, particularly for the poor and women. Most of nonagricultural self-employment takes place in microenterprises owned and operated by the household (Figure1.18). Self-employed individuals working for themselves in small-scale commerce or service activities account for 65.9 percent of employment in the sector. Of the individual enterprises, 22 percent include the owner as well as unpaid family helpers from the same household. Only a small share of individual enterprises (approximately 10.4 percent) relies on workers from outside the households. As such, this sector includes household enterprises of very different nature than formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that mostly rely on wage workers.The median individual in nonagricultural self-employment tends to be young female with no formal education. The majority of household enterprises are in small-scale service activities, and almost all are Figure1.18 Nonagricultural household enterprises have a rather different profile than formal SMEs Source: ENSETE 2013; authors' display. 65.9 22.0 10.4 1.6 self-employed self-employed with family helpers with 1-4 employees 5+ employees informal.

Peanut soup and roasted peanuts are the primary uses at present with a peanut beverage served in restaurants.	Strength: Rate of progress on the achievement of the project objectives has been very satisfactory and can be attributed to a broad-based and very experienced U.S. and ANAPO teams, which should ensure maximum success. Technology transfer through the program has resulted in production above present consumption, which may cause glut in the market. Purchase by the Japanese company has adsorbed some of the over production. In order for farmers to continue to expand production and reap the economic benefits, research in food technology needs to be implemented to develop an expanded choice of peanut products to expand domestic consumption. Peanut soup and roasted peanuts are the primary uses at present with a peanut beverage served in restaurants.

When the goods are loaded aboard the exporting carrier, the freight forwarder completes the necessary documentation.	A Typical Letter of Credit Transaction Here are the typical steps in issuing an irrevocable letter of credit that has been confirmed by a U.S. bank: 1. After the exporter and the buyer have agreed on the terms of a sale, the buyer arranges for its bank to open a letter of credit that specifies the documents needed for payment. The buyer determines which documents will be required. 2. The buyer's bank issues (opens) its irrevocable letter of credit and includes all instructions to the seller relating to the shipment. 3. The buyer's bank sends its irrevocable letter of credit to a U.S. bank and requests confirmation. The exporter may request that a particular U.S. bank be the confirming bank, or the foreign bank may select a U.S. correspondent bank. 4. The U.S. bank prepares a letter of confirmation to forward to the exporter, along with the irrevocable letter of credit. 5. The exporter carefully reviews all conditions in the letter of credit. The exporter's freight forwarder is contacted to make sure that the shipping date can be met. If the exporter cannot comply with one or more of the conditions, the customer is alerted at once because an amendment may be necessary. 6. The exporter arranges with the freight forwarder to deliver the goods to the appropriate port or airport. 7. When the goods are loaded aboard the exporting carrier, the freight forwarder completes the necessary documentation. 8. The exporter (or the freight forwarder) presents the documents, evidencing full compliance with the letter of credit terms, to the U.S. bank. 9. The bank reviews the documents. If they are in order, the documents are sent to the buyer's bank for review and then transmitted to the buyer. 10. The buyer (or the buyer's agent) uses the documents to claim the goods. 11. A sight or time draft accompanies the letter of credit. A sight draft is paid on presentation; a time draft is paid within a specified time period.	n

"The nature of work is changing as well. Industrial countries are experiencing a sustained shift away from primary and traditional manufacturing industries toward services and knowledge-intensive jobs. At the same time, technology improvements and greater reliance on outsourcing to developing countries is leading to a decline in middle-skilled jobs.28 Technology has allowed production tasks to be splintered and therefore performed in different locations.29 Jobs can transform women's roles in households and in society more broadly. In a community of 3,000 inhabitants outside Durban, South Africa, 80 percent of the women were estimated to be working outside their home, mainly as teachers and nurses but also in offices and retail outlets or with the police. Women did not have such opportunities 10 years ago. ""Women are no longer regarded as housewives,"" a young woman remarked in a Durban focus group."	n

In these Project PUR10U - 128 - countries, close relationships have been developed with consumers who participate in the studies as Subjects and benefit from the learning experience about their personal health relative to diet and nutrition. In Accra, Ghana, researchers have developed a partnership between the Food Research Institute and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. The partnership is helping to understand the nutritional needs of populations in three parts of the world, North America, South America and West Africa. Much of the nutrition technology coming from these studies show our problems and ways to overcome them are similar, at least in these three parts of the world. It is noted that the Purdue University Administrators are strong supporters of international programs. Peanut CRSP is a highly regarded program at the university, and the U.S.A. Principal Investigator (Dr. Richard Mattes), is highly regarded by his colleagues. He is a collaborating scientist on three CRSP programs (Peanut, Bean-Cowpea, and Sorghum-Millet). Dr. Mattes brings his nutrition expertise to these programs and a number of University Departments as he serves on key committees. Recently, he was instrumental in the development of a Nutragrain Bar made with bean paste fitting the sensory and nutritional needs of the peoples of Honduras, Central America.	n

The Ecological Footprint measures the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to produce the resources an individual, population or activity consumes and to absorb the waste they generate, given prevailing technology and resource management.	For more examples of research collaborations or national Footprint reviews, please visit www.footprintnetwork.org/reviews. Frequently asked questions how is the ecological footprint calculated? The Ecological Footprint measures the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to produce the resources an individual, population or activity consumes and to absorb the waste they generate, given prevailing technology and resource management. This area is expressed in global hectares, hectares with world-average biological productivity. Footprint calculations use yield factors to take into account national differences in biological productivity (e.g., tonnes of wheat per UK hectare versus per Argentina hectare) and equivalence factors to take into account differences in world average productivity among land types (e.g., world average forest versus world average cropland).	n
Human rights abuses and violations continue to be reported at an alarming rate, including torture, arbitrary arrest, detention and forced disappearances.	What began as a political crisis in the North-West and South-West regions has now turned into a significant, complex humanitarian emergency with about 2.3 million people in need, an increase of 80 per cent compared with 2019 and an almost fifteenfold increase since 2018. The crisis has displaced nearly 700,000 people and left 850,000 children out of school. Attacks on medical staff and infrastructure have become a frequent occurrence. More than 80 per cent of Government-run health facilities are closed in the two regions, and the remaining are only partially functional. There has been an increase in maternal and infant mortality rates, and in some areas only 6 per cent of adolescent girls and women are giving birth in health centres. Human rights abuses and violations continue to be reported at an alarming rate, including torture, arbitrary arrest, detention and forced disappearances. In August 2019 alone, more than 800 protection incidents were reported, namely unlawful killings, torture and inhuman treatment. Men, especially young men, are particularly affected by such violations.	n

The third aspect of migration and health is how health-care systems respond to migration and health.	The third aspect of migration and health is how health-care systems respond to migration and health. The health-care system is itself a determinant of health and, depending on the policies and legal frameworks of individual States, migrants may not be granted adequate, equitable and affordable access to health services, and/or local health systems may not have sufficient capacity to manage migrant health needs. For example, in countries of protracted crisis, migrant children fleeing conflict settings and seeking asylum with their families are more likely to have not met their vaccination targets due to disruptions in health-care delivery in countries of origin. Where health services are available, certain migrant groups may find it difficult to express symptomology and understand treatment instructions due to language barriers. Different cultural constructs of illness causation, such as those concerning mental health, challenge effective clinical management.22 They may also have difficulty with navigating unfamiliar health and welfare systems - especially when coming from countries with severely disrupted health systems.	n
"Jobs are mainly created by the private sector with government intervention justified when individual incentives are misaligned with social goals--when, for example, employment is not rewarding for women, when young people are ""queuing"" to be civil servants, when cities are too congested to productively absorb more rural migrants, or when logistics costs are too high for domestic firms to engage in international trade."	"An active role of government, however, needs to be carefully considered. Jobs are mainly created by the private sector with government intervention justified when individual incentives are misaligned with social goals--when, for example, employment is not rewarding for women, when young people are ""queuing"" to be civil servants, when cities are too congested to productively absorb more rural migrants, or when logistics costs are too high for domestic firms to engage in international trade. In these cases, government policy should aim to remove the constraints that prevent individuals, farms, and firms from making the best choices for society. If constraints cannot be precisely identified, or reforms are not politically feasible, policies can aim at offsetting the constraints rather than relieving them directly. In most cases, the policies to create good jobs for development lie outside of the labor market."	n

For invasions in natural environments, the goals will ideally include the preservation or restoration of that environment; the control of a IAS is only the first step in this process.	An assessment of the status and trends of bioinvasion in a given area is fundamental first step in the development of a national plan for dealing with IAS issues. The Plan itself should include a strategy to build institutional support and engage all important stakeholders in the effort, particularly local communities. This national strategy will be needed to make a national commitment operational. Goals and objectives for a national plan need to shared across sectors and the strategy needs to be integrated into larger national plans for conservation and agricultural development. For invasions in natural environments, the goals will ideally include the preservation or restoration of that environment; the control of a IAS is only the first step in this process. Existing legal and institutional frameworks also need to assessed and reviewed as these are key to the sustainability of any national effort to address the problems. There is also need to have concerted bilateral, regional and sometimes global actions based on common objectives. Finally, basic biological knowledge (e.g. taxonomy) must be combined with evolving technologies and tools for management. These tools rely heavily on the existence of reliable and taxonomically comprehensive data. Broadly speaking, any national plan should comprehensively address the four categories of tools and processes for IAS management: prevention, early detection, eradication, and control. The following section provides a brief summary of these issues. Detailed descriptions and case studies for the examples mentioned below can be found in the Toolkit.	n

Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city.	Conflict-affected countries: Rwanda Rwanda today seems far removed from the war and genocide of the mid-1990s, and jobs contribtotally or partially sold to private investors. By the turn of the century, greenfield FDI investments had become the norm, especially in sectors such as garments, footwear, appliances, and consumer electronics.55 Firms in these sectors are employing workers in large numbers. Important challenges remain, but Vietnam is The Republic of Korea effectively used policies to bring out the agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by 2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.	n
Differences in primary school enrolment levels for boys and girls and competition between them are still very significant in a number of countries.	According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the expansion of educational opportunities over the past several decades has clearly affected girls, although this has not been a result of deliberate policy to reduce gender disparities in educational access. Girls' education, measured by gross primary school enrolment ratios, has improved substantially in the Middle East and North Africa region, for example. Nevertheless, in 1990, the region still had 44 million illiterate mothers, a large and increasing backlog leftover from times of lower enrolment levels. Differences in primary school enrolment levels for boys and girls and competition between them are still very significant in a number of countries. In countries where overall enrolment is much lower than desired, girls are particularly disadvantaged.	n

But the training and transfer of scientific skills and knowledge in the nutrition field has much wider relevance.	This project is unique in being quite different and discrete from other projects in the food safety/food science Peanut CRSP cluster, which is dominated by food safety goal of controlling or reducing exposure to aflatoxins. In contrast, the focus in this project is on nutritional aspects related to peanuts and satiety, which arguably has a stronger level of interest in the U.S.A. than in developing countries. But the training and transfer of scientific skills and knowledge in the nutrition field has much wider relevance. The research being undertaken is very novel and has potential for promotion of peanut consumption as a healthy food, hence had great potential impact. This is a sound project area and the translation of the outcomes for practical benefit is obvious and shows potential impact.	n
Although air carriers may be more expensive, their cost may be offset by lower domestic shipping costs (e.g., using a local airport instead of a coastal seaport) and quicker delivery times.	"The Harmonized System (HS) describes products for customs purposes. It is recognized by 179 countries, customs bureaus, or economic unions, representing 98 percent of world trade. * Six-digit codes are assigned that represent general categories of goods. Countries that use HS numbers are allowed to define commodities at a more detailed level but must ""harmonize"" the first six digits to the HS framework. * Using these codes ensures that customs officials are referring to the same item when classifying the product and applying the tariff rate. 141Chapter 12: Shipping Your Product The cost of the shipment, delivery schedule, and accessibility to the shipped product by the foreign buyer are all factors to consider when determining the method of international shipping. Although air carriers may be more expensive, their cost may be offset by lower domestic shipping costs (e.g., using a local airport instead of a coastal seaport) and quicker delivery times. These factors may give the U.S. exporter an edge over other competitors."	n

At least eight Indigenous people died in police custody.	Indigenous children were 25 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous children. Leaked footage exposed abuses of children in prison in the Northern Territory, including tear gassing, restraints, choking and solitary confinement. In response, a Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory was established and reported on 17 November. An independent review of youth detention centres in Queensland released in April found abuses including solitary confinement, use of dogs to intimidate, missing CCTV footage, and children at risk of self-harm being sedated and hogtied. Further alleged abuses emerged in Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian capital territory and Western Australia. Indigenous adults were 15 times more likely to be jailed than non-Indigenous adults. At least eight Indigenous people died in police custody. The government did not adopt a national plan to ensure Australia meets its obligations 80 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 in protecting the rights of Indigenous children.

Indeed, development happens through jobs.	Jobs are the cornerstone of economic and social development. Indeed, development happens through jobs. People work their way out of poverty and hardship through better livelihoods. Economies grow as people get better at what they do, as they move from farms to firms, and as more productive jobs are created and less productive ones disappear. Societies flourish as jobs bring together people from different ethnic and social backgrounds and nurture a sense of opportunity. Jobs are thus transformational--they can transform what we earn, what we do, and even who we are.	n

One distinguishes between natural (biotic and abiotic factors) and manmade resources (infrastructure, buildings, machines, human knowledge). Natural resources are differentiated according to whether they are renewable (plants, animals, water in the context of its natural cycle) or nonrenewable (mineral deposits, coal, petroleum, even soil). In everyday language, natural resources are often taken to mean only those which are renewable. The nonrenewable resources are finite and depletable. In this brochure the concepts renewable natural resources/raw materials and regenerative resources/ raw materials are used synonymously.	n

Implement disability-specific schemes that effectively address disability-related additional costs (for example, assistive products, personal care and rehabilitation). These schemes should be accessible to persons with disabilities and promote greater participation, autonomy and choice by persons with disabilities themselves. Moreover, these programmes should advance the participation of persons with disabilities in the labour force by supporting and financing training and rehabilitation services needed for persons with disabilities to work. This support should be available for all persons with disabilities, regardless of whether they have worked before or not. 2) Remove barriers and obstacles that persons with disabilities face in accessing and fully benefiting from social protection on an equal basis with others.

In the city of Rio de Janeiro, a spike in violence saw a surge in unlawful killings by the police, with soaring rates of killings and other human rights violations elsewhere in the country. Little was done to reduce the number of homicides, to control the use of force by the police or to guarantee Indigenous Peoples' rights. The chaotic, overcrowded and dangerous state of Brazil's prisons resulted in more than 120 deaths of inmates during riots reported in January. Despite the homicide rate falling in Honduras, there were serious concerns about high levels of violence and insecurity; prevalent impunity undermined public trust in the authorities and the justice system. Massive protests took place throughout the country - denouncing the lack of transparency around the presidential election held in November - and were violently repressed by security forces, leading to at least 31people being killed, dozens arbitrarily detained and others injured. Dozens of unlawful killings by the security forces were reported in the Dominican Republic, which endured a persistently high homicide rate. Jamaica's police continued to commit unlawful killings - some potentially amounting to extrajudicial executions - with impunity. 30 Amnesty International report 2017/18 .	n

Infrastructure has also improved, with particularly impressive growth in the number of airlines and route capacity. Despite these gains, world-class infrastructure remains concentrated among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The Gulf countries have been able to use their natural resource wealth, central geographic location and relative security to develop world-class T&T infrastructure, defined by quality airports, ports, roads, tourist services and some of the world's leading airlines. These efforts are in stark contrast to some other MENA nations that--due to a lack of investment and ongoing instability--have yet to develop competitive infrastructure, especially regarding air transport. Similarly, the region's above-average score on the Enabling Environment subindex is due to the performance of the Gulf countries and Israel, which have developed economies, strong business environments, ICT readiness and some of the highest scores in safety and security. Finally, most regional economies also score near the bottom when it comes to female participation in the labour market, depriving the T&T industry of a greater labour and skills pool.	n

This strategy, whereby smallholder farmers sell crops in response to the need for cash, supports short-term survival and does not Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ enable accumulation and sale of surplus production, thereby restricting the flow of investment in farm improvement (Eriksen and Silva 2009).	Less than 6% of sampled households sold more than 50% of their rice in private markets (Table 1), indicating that rice cropping generates little or no financial return for the majority of rice farmers. This lack of cash income restricts the ability of rice farmers to purchase food in markets or to invest in rice cropping to improve productivity or output, i.e., buy more land, change to more productive/less vulnerable plots, or hire more labor. Households often sell rice to meet short-term household costs. This is distinctly different from a commercially orientated strategy of generating surpluses to sell and generate income. One rice farmer commented that he does not sell after harvest, but if he needs something later he will sell his rice because it is nearly impossible to save (SSI:12)[4][5]. Another farmer noted that they do not sell rice to markets unless they are really desperate (SSI:17).

Because economies grow as high-productivity jobs are created and low-productivity jobs disappear, the relationship between productivity gains and job creation is not mechanical.

Not having a job undermines life satisfaction, especially in countries where wage employment is the norm and where the lack of opportunities translates into open unemployment rather than underemployment. Among those employed, the material, nonmaterial, and even subjective characteristics of jobs can all have an impact on well-being.37 Other features such as workplace safety, job security, learning and advancement opportunities, and health and social protection benefits are valued by workers. But relatively few jobs offer these advantages in developing countries.	n

CHWs are uniquely suited to engage communities and lead community mobilization efforts by identifying and recruiting additional resources for health, working with communities to identify health priorities, and mobilizing key stakeholders.	"Community mobilization is a process of raising a community's awareness of an issue and involvement in identifying and activating resources and leadership to address it. Community mobilization has long been recognized as a critical strategy for improving health outcomes, and there exists a rich body of literature evidencing successful mobilization on a range of health issues (234-237). CHWs are uniquely suited to engage communities and lead community mobilization efforts by identifying and recruiting additional resources for health, working with communities to identify health priorities, and mobilizing key stakeholders. However, previous reviews of literature examining the tasks that CHWs perform provide little evidence of CHWs being conceptualized as community mobilizers (17). 7.14.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that the evidence found on this question suggests, but does not provide conclusive evidence of, a positive potential for a role for CHWs in mobilizing community resources for health. No known or theoretical risks arising from such activities were identified through the review of the evidence and the GDG discussions. As the evidence was extremely limited in volume and scope, and characterized by a very low level of certainty on the effects, the GDG adopted a conditional recommendation in favour of the policy option under consideration. 7.14.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.14) on the question - ""In the context of community health worker (CHW) programmes, should practising CHWs mobilize wider community resources for health versus not?""

In June 2010, U.S. stakeholders submitted applications to be able to use the terms in connection with products sold within the EU. In 2012, the EU approved the applications for use of two terms, ""cream"" and ""classic,"" but the EU's delayed application approval process for other terms continues to be a significant concern. The United States has repeatedly raised this issue in the WTO TBT Committee in recent years and also has pursued bilateral discussions. Beyond approving the two terms, the EU has not taken any visible steps to address U.S. concerns. In 2013, the Commission started discussions with the Member States on a possible simplification of wine labeling set out in Regulation 607/2009. In May 2018, the EU notified to the WTO draft regulations related to wine labeling. However, the draft regulations do not appear to resolve the concerns, particularly as relates to the use of ""traditional terms."" The U.S. Government and industry have expressed concern about the draft, including through written comments, and will continue to engage with the EU on this issue."	n

Online and offline censorship undermined advances in education.	In Cuba, large numbers of human rights defenders and political activists continued to be harassed, intimidated, dismissed from state employment and arbitrarily detained to silence criticism. Online and offline censorship undermined advances in education. Prisoners of conscience included the leader of the pro-democracy Christian Liberation Movement, Eduardo Cardet Concepcion, who was jailed for three years for publicly criticizing former president Fidel Castro. Human rights defenders in Guatemala, especially those working on land, territorial and environmental issues, faced ongoing threats and attacks, and were subjected to smear campaigns. The justice system was also frequently misused to target, harass and silence human rights defenders. A ruling by Peru's Supreme Court confirming the acquittal of human rights defender Maxima Acuna Atalaya after five years of unfounded criminal proceedings for land seizure was a landmark decision for environmental defenders. 34 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 .	n
On that ground, Benjamin and Mbaye (2012) establish criteria to classify firms in six different levels of informality.	Still, the above-mentioned criteria have been subject to criticism. It isdifficult to define the informal sector in a dichotomized manner (Benjamin and Mbaye 2012). Existing definitions do not sufficiently distinguish between formal and informal firms. Some scholars prefer to coin the informal sector as a 'continuum' with different degrees of formality (Steel and Snodgrass 2008). On that ground, Benjamin and Mbaye (2012) establish criteria to classify firms in six different levels of informality.	n
Irreversible damage to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they provide, worsened by air, soil, water, and marine pollution.	Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security. Irreversible damage to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they provide, worsened by air, soil, water, and marine pollution.  Extreme weather events, many worsened by accelerating sea level rise, will particularly affect urban coastal areas in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Damage to communication, energy, and transportation infrastructure could affect low-lying military bases, inflict economic costs, and cause human displacement and loss of life.  Changes in the frequency and variability of heat waves, droughts, and floods--combined with poor governance practices--are increasing water and food insecurity around the world, increasing the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jordan.  Diminishing Arctic sea ice may increase competition--particularly with Russia and China-- over access to sea routes and natural resources. Nonetheless, Arctic states have maintained mostly positive cooperation in the region through the Arctic Council and other multilateral mechanisms, a trend we do not expect to change in the near term. Warmer temperatures and diminishing sea ice are reducing the high cost and risks of some commercial activities and are attracting new players to the resource-rich region. In 2018, the minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic was 25 percent below the 30-year average from 1980 to 2010. Regional threats .	n

Two studies were located in South Africa, two in the United States, and one in the Islamic Republic of Iran.	"The broader policy discourse on education of other health workers in recent years has identified a number of issues contributing indirect evidence that can be considered WHO guideline on health policy and system support to optimize community health worker programmes42 also in the education of CHWs, including the potential for broadening the focus of health education to enable health workers to be change agents in the communities they serve (78); the opportunities opened by interprofessional education approaches (79); and the link between locating education institutions and training in underserved areas and the retention of health workers in these settings (80). 7.4.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG intended to provide guidance to inform decisions on appropriate delivery modalities for pre-service education. The findings of the systematic review were limited in scope, and did not directly compare alternative modalities for the delivery of pre-service education. Therefore, the GDG considered as a basis for the recommendation also the broader evidence emerging from the review of reviews and indirect evidence on health worker education, recognizing the limitations and caveats of applying it to CHWs as well. 7.4.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.4) addressing the question - ""For CHWs receiving pre-service training, should the curriculum use specific delivery modalities versus not?"" (81) - identified five eligible studies (one quantitative, four qualitative). Two studies were located in South Africa, two in the United States, and one in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The quantitative study was an RCT comparing the benefits of training CHWs in person or through web-based methods with a training approach based on mailing training materials to CHWs, finding no differences in outcomes (82)."	n

Remote sensing technologies are rapidly evolving to detect the restoration of degraded areas or outside forested areas.	These experiences underscore the need for a consistent and feasible framework to assess the economic impacts of FLR approaches across different countries. IUCN is now working to develop a consistent framework to assess both jobs and induced economic impact from FLR actions. This framework will be tested and adapted to the diverse contexts found across the Bonn Challenge pledgers and ultimately offered as a means of reporting on this indicator. Finally, the demand for applying the Barometer as a means to credibly track progress on FLR implementation continues to grow. Self-assessments allow more pledgers to participate; however, the need for capacity to record adequate data and analyse findings remains strong. Remote sensing technologies are rapidly evolving to detect the restoration of degraded areas or outside forested areas. Such spatially explicit monitoring of restoration over multiple years can contribute data to the Barometer and also serve to triangulate information received from secondary sources such as project reports. To allow for transparency in tracking restoration within a landscape and within a mosaic of land uses, and to detect leakage at the national scale, Bonn Challenge pledgers should prioritise spatially explicit information on restoration sites. Accessing and making this spatial data publicly available is part of ongoing efforts. Indeed the development and application of the Barometer has benefited from existing national monitoring systems, as in El Salvador and the USA, but has also catalysed efforts by governments in pilot countries to accelerate the establishment of national FLR monitoring systems, for example in Brazil, or enhance the type of monitoring taking place, as in Rwanda.	n
However, biotechnology research may be conducted in laboratory greenhouses, and in 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology (under the Ministry of Education and Science) developed a transgenic breed of cotton with higher pesticide resistance.	Kazakhstan continues to enforce CU regulations covering agricultural biotechnology products, which require the labeling of both imported and domestically produced agricultural biotechnology products. As Kazakhstan continues to integrate into the EAEU, it is expected that the policies and views of other EAEU countries will play a greater role in shaping the regulation of agricultural biotechnology in Kazakhstan.

In 2012 and 2013, Kazakhstan and Russia both banned the importation of GE-corn NK603 as a result of a published study by a French scientist questioning the safety of that type of GE-corn. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refuted the scientific validity of the study and noted it should not be considered as valid for risk assessment. Russia removed the ban without any public acknowledgement, and Kazakhstan has not made public the status of its ban. Therefore, it is effectively still in place, and no one has attempted to import this line of corn.	n

As an interim step, the Ministry of Education appealed to universities on 21 April 2020 to release health staff to attend to the COVID-19 response.	Although the Kenyan Treasury has made US$ 10 million available to hire extra staff, it is not clear how staff will be scaled up in the counties. As an interim step, the Ministry of Education appealed to universities on 21 April 2020 to release health staff to attend to the COVID-19 response. County governors have asked the national government for 6,000 to 7,000 extra health workers; however, funding has been declined. 43 See www.who.int/hrh/statistics/hwfstats/en/ (c) Maintains 91 Pakistan also has a shortage of human resources. Ministerial estimates assume an extra 60,000 doctors, 160,000 nurses, 105,000 paramedics, and 25,000 laboratory technicians will be needed to adequately staff treatment centres, isolation and high-dependency units, and makeshift hospitals for the next three to six months. Provincial and federal governments have ongoing joint efforts to recruit essential health cadres on a short-term basis to enhance surge capacity. However, social distancing and the absence of virtual training methodologies make it difficult to provide appropriate training to newly recruited staff. Appropriate fast-track training approaches are pending. This training is expected to pay special attention to IPC, including waste management, as IPC is a recognised area of weakness in public health facilities.	n
In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live.	G P E 20 18 m ile st on e fo r pr im ar y (1 8. 3% ) GPE 2018 milestone for lower secondary (31.3%) ALB BFA BEN BTN CMR DJI ERI GEO GHA GIN GUY HND KGZ KHM LAO LSO MDA MRT MOZ NER PNG SSD STP UZB Non-FCACs FCACs CAF CIV ETH COM LBR MLI NPL PAK SDN SLE TLS ZWE YEM One of the key reasons why performance is poorer on out-ofschool rates than on completion rates, discussed above, is that the out-of-school rates include children who are in school but older than the official age range for their school level (that is, primary age or lower secondary age). When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.	n

Other leading investors in Cameroon include Germany, Belgium and China, with the gas and oil industry attracting the most investment.	Reduced FDI from France over 2006-2008, English-speaking countries hold low share France is the main single source of foreign investment in Cameroon. However, FDI inflow from France declined to only US$53 million in 2008, down from just over US$113 million in 2006. FDI from the US also fell from US$33 million in 2005 to just US$4 million in 2008 in fixed exchange rate terms, according to the OECD. The main reason behind the decline in overall FDI from 2006 onwards is high commodity prices on items such as coffee and palm oil as well as the global economic downturn. Other leading investors in Cameroon include Germany, Belgium and China, with the gas and oil industry attracting the most investment. The FDI of English-speaking countries represented less than 2% of total FDI in Cameroon in 2008. This has a dampening effect on the development of English in Cameroon, particularly when compared with high levels of French FDI. Nevertheless, this has not diminished the importance placed on the English language by ambitious individuals or the government. 375 264 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow (2005-2009) - US$ million English language quantitative indicators !

This is broadly understood within the business community - however, rising tensions between French-and English-speaking territories in Cameroon may hinder this. Research shows that Cameroon is continuing its investment in education, as this is seen as fundamental to FDI. According to company interviews, the banking, services, technology, mining and quarrying industries are the leading industries that are in need for English speakers. Euromonitor's research also indicates a correlation between industry productivity and the percentage of English speakers.

It is crucial to promoting maternal and child health and preventing discrimination against women in the workplace.	Over time, the primary concerns of the ILO with respect to maternity protection have remained the same: to enable women to combine their reproductive and productive roles successfully; to prevent unequal treatment at work due to their reproductive role KEY MESSAGES n Maternity protection is a fundamental human right and an indispensable element of comprehensive work-family policies. It is crucial to promoting maternal and child health and preventing discrimination against women in the workplace. n The goal of maternity protection legislation is to enable women to combine their reproductive and productive roles successfully and to promote equal opportunities and treatment in employment and occupation, without prejudice to health or economic security. n A total of 66 countries ratified at least one of the three maternity protection Conventions adopted by ILO member States since 1919. n Virtually every country around the world provides some type of maternity protection legislation and many others also adopted measures to support workers with family responsibilities. n Fathers undertaking a more active role in caregiving is likely to be one of the most significant social developments of the twenty-first century. 2 Maternity and paternity at work Introduction and to promote equal opportunities and treatment in employment and occupation, without prejudice to health or economic security.

A key aspect of the model is the formal health system (including the public sector directly and private sector indirectly), which includes both: * 'hardware': six building blocks of the health workforce - health information systems; supplies and infrastructure; finance; governance, leadership and management; and service delivery; and * 'software': the people within the system.	A key aspect of the model is the formal health system (including the public sector directly and private sector indirectly), which includes both: * 'hardware': six building blocks of the health workforce - health information systems; supplies and infrastructure; finance; governance, leadership and management; and service delivery; and * 'software': the people within the system. This includes both tangible software (their capacity and the formal processes by which people act) and intangible software (the informal rules, values, and norms that shape relationships and interactions among actors, and which are themselves shaped by the socio-political context in which the health system operates) (Sheikh et al., 2011). (c) Maintains 120 The literature shows that both hardware and software components of a formal health system are important in determining how well that system can be responsive to a shock (Kruk et al., 2015).

They make learning more pleasant to the students because they offer a reality of experiences, which stimulates self activity and imagination on the part of the students.	Teaching materials are very important in the whole process of teaching and learning to any subject. They make learning more pleasant to the students because they offer a reality of experiences, which stimulates self activity and imagination on the part of the students. Attitudes refer to the sets of beliefs that the learner holds towards members of the target group and also towards his own culture (Brown, 2000). Language attitude is an important concept because it plays a key role in language learning. In education, attitudes are considered both as input and output. Motivation is the most used concept for explaining failure or success of a learner. Also motivation has been regarded as one of the main factors that influence the speed and amount of success of foreign language learners. (Gardener, 2006). It has been seen that passive learning, lack of adequate materials for teaching, motivation of the students and attitudes towards learning keeping the rural area students inefficient in English language compared to urban students.	n
WARDA views the regional rice science infrastructure as an integrated and interdependent system.	Partnership with national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) The goal of WARDA's partnership with national systems is to achieve the most cost-effective means of developing and transferring new rice technologies within the region as a whole. WARDA views the regional rice science infrastructure as an integrated and interdependent system. Because agroecological environments cut across political boundaries, technologies developed in any single location are usually transferable to far broader areas. The objectives of WARDA's partnership with NARES are to achieve a more complementary and efficient sharing of research tasks by allocating responsibilities on the basis of comparative advantage, and to maximize research spillover between these systems and WARDA, and among the national systems themselves.	n

Turkish documentation requirements for food imports are onerous, inconsistent, and non-transparent, often resulting in shipments delayed at Turkish ports. U.S. exporters of rice, dried beans, pulses, sunflower seeds, wheat, and walnuts, have reported concerns with decisions by Turkish customs authorities on the valuation of some of their products. Turkey ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in March 2016. Turkey has designated all commitments under Section I as Category A. However, Turkey has yet to provide to the WTO the relevant information under the TFA's transparency provisions, which was due to the WTO Secretariat by entry into force of the Agreement on February 22, 2017.	n

Some tools are available to help make the decision about category, but in many cases the final decision will be a matter of collective judgement.	n
This variable aims to capture technology differences between countries in explaining trade patterns.	The relative factor endowment variable (RFE) is defined as the absolute value of the difference between natural logarithm of per capita GDPs between country i and country j. The choice of this variable as an explanatory variable is based on the standard comparative advantage explanation of trade. This variable aims to capture technology differences between countries in explaining trade patterns. Though this variable is generally measured as the absolute value of the difference between natural logarithm of capital-labour ratio, due to the unavailability of that data, per capita GDP is used in place of capital-labour ratios. Thus, relative factor endowment is defined as: 42 | OECD BUSINESS AND FINANCE OUTLOOK 2018 (c) OECD 2018              = |                 -                 | The similarity index (SIM) is defined as:              =      [1 - (                       +            ) - (                       +            ) ] Similarity with respect to GDP per capita implies increased similarity in size of countryspecific product diversity in the differentiated goods sector and that leads to an increased trade volume.	n

Despite a slight decline in availability, new psychoactive substances, particularly cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids, continue to pose a significant challenge to drug control efforts in the region, which is one of the largest and most diversified markets in the world for new psychoactive substances. Most manufacture, trafficking and abuse of new psychoactive substances in the region takes place in Canada and the United States, with reports of new psychoactive substances having tripled in those two countries between 2010 and 2013. A major challenge is that those substances continue to be widely available through retail outlets in both countries, as well as through the Internet. 432.

The productivity of jobs in declining industries may be low, but it can still be higher than the alternatives.	The long-term consequences and costs of decoupling can be higher than is usually thought. During periods of massive structural change, the reallocation of workers out of declining industries can lead to large output losses because little alternative employment is available. The productivity of jobs in declining industries may be low, but it can still be higher than the alternatives. Similarly, during crises, firms might not be insolvent but rather illiquid. Death of inherently solvent firms could cause loss of firm-specific human capital and intangible assets, disruption of value chains, and damage to surrounding communities. While the provision of credit would be the preferred solution, identifying insolvent firms might not always be feasible and could be marred by transparency problems. Temporary job protection policies can be a workable alternative to provide a lifeline for struggling, but inherently solvent, firms.	n

The extent to which foods indigenous to the New World today comprise an important portion of the world's diet is illustrated by Table 1, which reports the world's most popular foods in 2000. Thefirst list reports foods with popularity measured by the average consumption of calories per person per day. Because this measure may overstate the popularity of high-calorie food crops, we also provide rankings based on production and land under cultivation. These are reported in the second and third lists. Foods that are indigenous to the New World are reported in bold text. From the table it is clear that today New World foods are an important part of our diets.

The share of wage employment in manufacturing is much smaller. A comparison across several French-speaking Sub-Saharan African countries puts the fraction at less than 5 percent of total employment even in the capital cities--less than 3 percent in Cotonou and Lome to 8 percent in Yaounde; only Antananarivo has more than 10 percent.2 Across Sub-Saharan Africa, one-quarter or less of formal sector workers are women; only in Senegal does the fraction exceed one-third.3 If anything, employment in the formal sector has trended downward over the past two decades as state-owned enterprises have been privatized and foreign trade has been liberalized.	n

Air transport, which accounts for over half the region's arrivals, has greatly improved as an uptick in travel in recent years has led to an increase in the number of air carriers and route capacity.	Travel throughout the region is also bolstered by world-class infrastructure. Air transport, which accounts for over half the region's arrivals, has greatly improved as an uptick in travel in recent years has led to an increase in the number of air carriers and route capacity. Europe's high concentration of airports and airlines also helps increase competition, thereby driving down airport and ticket prices, improving otherwise relatively low price competitiveness for much of the region. The compact geography of Europe (excluding Eurasia) also makes it ideal for ground transport, which includes high road and railroad density. In addition, regional economic integration, infrastructure and economic heft fuels significant business travel, with Europe hosting more international meetings than the rest of the world combined.	n

And Southern Asia. Universal health coverage, which refers to systems in which all people have access to adequate health care without financial hardship and in an equitable manner, has been instituted in only some developed countries.2 Its prioritization in developing regions is likely to be based on each country's epidemiological conditions, demographics, economic resources and current state of the health system.3 Biology determines the health needs and vulnerabilities specific to women and men. It is one of the main factors behind men's increased risk for a number of health problems, their higher mortality (starting from day one and extending throughout their lives), and their shorter life expectancy. However, medical and technological improvements over several decades are extending the lives of both men and women. In the case of women, maternal and reproductive health needs are increasingly being addressed through improved health systems and the delivery of services.4 For example, complete cover- 2 WHO and World Bank, 2014. 3 Boerma and others, 2014. 4 United Nations, 2014a.	n
IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules.	Type D: Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities. This type includes two main subsets: (1) indigenous peoples' areas and territories established and run by indigenous peoples and (2) community conserved areas established and run by local communities. The subsets, which may not be neatly separated, apply to both sedentary and mobile peoples and communities. IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules. These can be relatively complex. For instance, land and/or sea resources may be collectively owned and managed while other resources may be managed individually or on a clan basis. Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times, or of different resources within the same area. Rules generally intertwine with cultural and spiritual values. The customary rules and organizations managing natural resources often possess no statutory legal recognition or sanctioning power. In other cases, however, indigenous peoples and/or local communities are fully recognised as the legitimate authority in charge of state-listed protected areas or have legal title to the land, water or resources. Whatever the structure, the governance arrangements require IUCN recognises four broad types of governance of protected areas, any of which can be associated with any management objective: A. Governance by government B. Shared governance C. Private governance D. Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities 3.

HPI expresses how many happy life-years are squeezed out of each hectare of Ecological Footprint.	The concept of gross national happiness, which the King of Bhutan coined in a 1972 interview, was scientifically developed further, made quantifiable, and supplemented with an index number for the sustainability of resource utilization. HPI expresses how many happy life-years are squeezed out of each hectare of Ecological Footprint. Therefore the HPI is calculated by dividing longevity, adjusted by average subjective, by Ecological Footprint per capita numbers.	n

In order to scale up these initiatives, however, results show that government policies and programmes are needed to improve market structure, public extension services and subsidies, and access to credit and loans for alternative crops (67).	Crop substitution programmes While anecdotal evidence supports the finding that tobacco could be substituted with other crops that may be equally profitable, a systematic analysis of this issue is needed. A natural starting point would be a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the effects of removing farmers from tobacco production altogether on economic variables such as employment, skills, output, wages etc. Recent research has shown that smallholder farmers are receptive to shifting out of tobacco production when conditions allow. In order to scale up these initiatives, however, results show that government policies and programmes are needed to improve market structure, public extension services and subsidies, and access to credit and loans for alternative crops (67). Tobacco farmers, like most smallholder farmers in low-and middle-income countries, need policy reforms that put agricultural development at the centre of public services (215). Recognizing that such policy reforms can take time, and that growing tobacco undermines the economic growth and human and environmental health of farming communities, the development of government programmes designed specifically for the transition of tobacco farmers to alternative sustainable livelihoods are desirable in the immediate term.	n

More concerning was the enactment of a law on interior security that would enable the prolonged presence of the armed forces in regular policing functions, a strategy that has been linked to an increase in human rights violations.	"Mexico's human rights crisis continued, exacerbated by increases in violence and homicides, including a record number of killings of journalists. Arbitrary arrests and detentions remained widespread - often leading to further human rights violations, most of which were not properly investigated. More than 34,000 people remained subject to enforced disappearance, and extrajudicial executions were rife. Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be widespread and were committed with impunity by the security forces, with people routinely forced to sign false ""confessions"". However, the Senate's approval of a new law on enforced disappearances - following a national public outcry over the case of 43 forcibly disappeared students whose fate and whereabouts remained undisclosed - was a potential step forward, although its eventual implementation will require serious political commitment to ensure justice, truth and reparations. Congress also finally passed a new general law on torture. More concerning was the enactment of a law on interior security that would enable the prolonged presence of the armed forces in regular policing functions, a strategy that has been linked to an increase in human rights violations."	n

Another option is for specific Project Team to include a sociologist and an economist in its multi-disciplinary team (i.e., UGA11).	Data analysis and reporting for the impact assessment of training in Thailand should be completed. The report should be disseminate all Peanut CRSP Principal Investigators so all projects with training components could learn lessons on evaluating training courses and their impact on the overall effort by Peanut CRSP and the Host Country institutions. Analysis of the data sets from the Philippine impact study should be completed and facilitate preparation of joint papers for publication in refereed journals. Transfer the impact assessment and case study methodologies, including samples of survey instruments, to other Peanut CRSP projects in other regions, using the experiences in the Philippines and Thailand. Instead of implementing a stand alone socio-economic study, such as NCSO7, the Peanut CRSP Management Entity should consider integrating the social and economic aspects into all Peanut CRSP projects in the next phase. The NCSU Project Team could collaborate with other Principal Investigators to do this. Another option is for specific Project Team to include a sociologist and an economist in its multi-disciplinary team (i.e., UGA11).

OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 3 This technical paper was written by researchers from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) to document the piloting and development of the WEAI so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings. The index evolved in late 2010 and early 2011 out of discussions among US government agencies involved in the Feed the Future Initiative regarding the need for an indicator to monitor women's empowerment. The discussions initially revolved around using a gender perceptions index but eventually focused on an index similar to the multidimensional poverty indexes being developed by OPHI. Following the definition of 5DE in agriculture by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), work began at IFPRI in June-July 2011 to develop questionnaire modules that could be used to elicit responses on each of these domains. The full survey--with household and individual questionnaires, administered to a primary male and a primary female respondent in each household 4 --was piloted from September to November 2011 in Feed the Future zones of influence in Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda. Index development took place from November 2011 to January 2012. Qualitative interviews and case studies with individuals, as well as a technical consultation with outside experts in January 2012, provided further input into the choice of indicators that comprise the index. The WEAI itself was launched on February 28, 2012, at the 56th session of the Committee on the Status of Women at the United Nations, New York, and subsequently in three separate presentations in March in London, New Delhi, and Washington, DC.	n
The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy.	Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school. The project program implies long-term comprehensive training, which is designed for a period of up to 9 years and can take place in parallel with the basic educa1on and in addi1on to it; 4. Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project. The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy. The total number of employees and developers is about 100 people; 5. Constant adjustment and upda1ng of the training program through the introduc1on of modern educa1onal modules, relevant training plaKorms, as well as interes1ng and non-standard tasks and projects for selfimplementa1on;6. Sources of stable financial flows: The volume of financial revenues of the company is formed through three permanent channels: training in its own divisions, the implementa1on of franchises (lump-sum contribu1ons), and regular payments by exis1ng franchisees (royal1es); 7. The possibility of replica1on of the project in any locality (popula1on size does not maher);8. The project's target audience is children and adolescents aged 6-14 (children at this age are especially suscep1ble to new knowledge, are interested in modern technologies, and ac1vely use gadgets, but use them mainly for entertainment) and their parents (they care about quality educa1on of their children, and precisely at the age of 6-14 invest the core capital in their development).	n

Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted.	"A systematic literature review of reported challenges in health-care delivery to migrants and refugees in highincome countries identified three main topics of challenges in health-care delivery: communication, continuity of care and confidence.23 Communication is critical for obvious diagnostic and treatment trajectories. The availability of trained interpreters from migrant communities was described as a key aspect in providing migrant-sensitive care. Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted. Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of the health-care system, integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system. Confidence was the third most common topic mentioned and related to trust in the health-care provider, ensuring cultural sensitivity in care provision and the ability to have agency. Studies indicated that, in cases where no trustful relationship was established, patients resorted to using traditional medicine and trusted ""their own resources"" from their community for treatment. Conversely, a systematic review that investigated the perceptions, attitudes and practices of health providers in the provision of health-care services for migrants found they were challenged not only by language and cultural barriers, but also by resource constraints within their workplaces, and incoherence between professional ethics and domestic laws that limited migrants' right to health care.24 Health-care providers used innovative means to ensure care provision in managing such clinical cases with civil society groups."	n
Ancestral midwives in Ecuador may refer patients for additional medical care, diagnose patients, and prescribe medicinal plants and natural remedies.	Practice Although there is limited availability of data within the nursing profession across South America, authorized practice seems to vary depending on nurse type. In Argentina, nurses and licensed nurses both have prescriptive authority and may prescribe any medications. However, neither may refer patients for additional care, nor may they diagnose patients. In Peru, a nurse has a duty to administer healthcare in an emergent situation and, because of this, nurse specialists and general nurses may prescribe medication or refer patients for additional medical care. Both nurse types may diagnose patients. Ancestral midwives in Ecuador may refer patients for additional medical care, diagnose patients, and prescribe medicinal plants and natural remedies. In Brazil, nurses and advanced or specialized nurses possess authority to offer a nursing diagnosis. In addition, these types of nurses may prescribe medications according to protocols, clinical and therapeutic guidelines, or other technical regulations established by the federal, state, or municipal authorities. These protocols and guidelines are subject to the legal provisions of the profession. Prescriptive authority granted to nurses and advanced or specialized nurses is regarding medications previously established in each respective public health program and those routinely approved by each health institution. Nurses and advanced or specialized nurses, however, do not have the autonomy to request examinations and prescribe medications in isolated private practices. These types of nurses must be working within a health team in order to prescribe, diagnose, or refer and request examinations.	n

Partnership with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Trade, and the Ugandan Board of Standards is required to tackle the health, trade, and related issues in a coherent manner.	Makerere University professor of Animal Science (Dr. Connie Kyalisiima) has proposed to carry out research in managing aflatoxin using Bentonite clay in animal feeds in Uganda, to be funded by NORAD (Norway) and in collaboration from Peanut CRSP. Experience working on gender issues in Peanut CRSP research in a host country like Uganda would provide strategies of mainstreaming gender in peanut research that Peanut CRSP could use in its work in developing countries. In the future, Peanut CRSP projects should include in their design strategies to ensure that women and children, who are usually disadvantaged groups in rural farming areas, would benefit directly from new technological interventions (i.e., resistant peanut varieties, aflatoxin-free peanut products, etc.) by Peanut CRSP. The ongoing work in aflatoxin in peanut in Uganda/region is linked with the HIV/AIDS and other illnesses. Possible solution to the aflatoxin problem (i.e., use of Bentonite clay), has implications to people's health. Work on health issues would require critical participation of the Ugandan Ministry of Health and trained village health workers, an area where Peanut CRSP is not a traditional player. Partnership with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Trade, and the Ugandan Board of Standards is required to tackle the health, trade, and related issues in a coherent manner.	n
Very good infrastructure and a fairly skilled workforce helped as well.	European integration, the economy successfully restructured its export sector to access EU markets. Very good infrastructure and a fairly skilled workforce helped as well. This dynamism, requiring the use of more advanced production and management techniques in modern sectors, was especially well-suited for youth. While the story is a good one in many ways, further policy reforms could help Slovenia realize more of the development payoffs that flow from jobs for young people. Some of these reforms are in the labor market, such as removing the incentives created by employment protection laws that tilt job creation for youth toward contract and temporary work. But others are outside the labor market, such as introducing measures to encourage more FDI.81 Connected jobs agendas: Global partnerships for jobs Policies for jobs in one country can have spillovers on other countries, both positive and negative. An important issue is whether international coordination mechanisms could influence the decisions that governments make, enhancing the positive spillovers and mitigating the negative ones. Several areas lend themselves to coordination. Promoting compliance with rights and labor standards, a global public good, is the most obvious one, but the effectiveness of the mechanisms for doing so is limited. Measures to facilitate FDI flows, especially in services, would have substantial effects on productivity in developing countries but they may also have social implications. Migration has impacts on both sending and recipient countries, suggesting that bilateral agreements could lead to better outcomes for both parties.	n
Political, legal and regulatory institutions; and 5.	We have also sought to address this issue through the PwC ESCAPE Index20, which was first launched in February 2014 and has since been updated for this report. This aims to provide a holistic view of the performance of 42 of the largest advanced and emerging economies since 2000. The index combines 20 key indicators across five dimensions: 1. Economic growth and stability; 2. Social progress and cohesion; 3. Communications Technology; 4. Political, legal and regulatory institutions; and 5. Environmental sustainability. 19 PwC's Country Risk Premium (CRP) analysis covers 187 sovereign nations using an economic model that PwC have developed since 1998. PwC's model uses a range of inputs in generating CRPs, including reliable sources of credit and risk ratings and sovereign bond information. The CRPs are updated on a quarterly basis.

In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men.	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.	n
Resourcerich countries need to diversify their exports, so that jobs are connected to global markets rather than supported through government transfers.	Which jobs have the greatest development payoffs depends on the circumstances. Countries differ in their level of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Agrarian socie ties face the challenge of making agricultural jobs more productive and creating job opportunities outside farms. Resourcerich countries need to diversify their exports, so that jobs are connected to global markets rather than supported through government transfers.

There are two branches of secondary education: general and specialized and technical/vocational.	Country Notes Basic education (Enseignement fondamental) lasts for nine years and leads to the Brevet d'enseignement fondamental. Secondary education is compulsory and consists of a three-year cycle of study provided in secondary schools and technicums. There are two branches of secondary education: general and specialized and technical/vocational. Students in general secondary and specialized secondary education study for three years. Successful students are awarded the Baccalaureat de l'Enseignement secondaire in one of the various streams offered. The Baccalaureat gives access to higher education but some institutions require it to be of a certain type (science, arts, etc.). The objective of technical and vocational secondary education is to prepare students for active life and industry (technicians and qualified workers). Studies last between one and four years, according to the type of training undertaken and can also lead to the Baccalaureat technique and higher education.

Inclusive and equitable quality education requires improvement and equity in both access and learning, so that all children have an equal chance to go to school and learn.	Inclusive and equitable quality education requires improvement and equity in both access and learning, so that all children have an equal chance to go to school and learn. This entails removing barriers through both targeted and system-level approaches. With partners, GPE supports capacity building in gender-responsive sector analysis and planning, with 13 more country delegations trained in 2018, and is supporting similar approaches to inclusive education for children with disabilities. Active implementation grant allocations to equity and learning as of June 2018 totaled US$582 million and US$373 million, respectively.	n

Small farmers using traditional production systems cannot afford chemical weed control, but herbicides are used in commercial aerobic rice systems in Brazil and China.	Biological and physical constraints to upland rice yield are numerous. Weeds are the most severe biological constraint, followed by blast disease and brown spot. Weeds reduce upland rice grain yield and quality. Estimates of yield losses caused by weeds in upland rice range from 30% to 100%. Small farmers using traditional production systems cannot afford chemical weed control, but herbicides are used in commercial aerobic rice systems in Brazil and China. Stem borers and rice bugs are the predominant insect pests. Nematodes can cause yield losses of up to 30%. Rodents are reported in many countries as a major problem and birds are sometimes serious pests.	n

Workers are hired and dismissed, or they quit their jobs and start their own businesses; meanwhile some firms close and others are born.	"Turnover versus decoupling Every day, jobs are created and destroyed. Workers are hired and dismissed, or they quit their jobs and start their own businesses; meanwhile some firms close and others are born. In industrial countries, this process of creative destruction affects around 15 percent of all jobs every year.86 In normal times, the probability of job loss for an individual is largely independent of the probability of job loss for another. And the probability of landing another job is also independent of what happens to other workers. The employment shock is then what economists call ""idiosyncratic."" But there are exceptional times, when employment shocks are systemic. Then, a sustained decoupling of the normal process of job creation and job destruction occurs: jobs are lost in large numbers but not created at the same pace. This is what occurs in times of severe economic crises, when a decline in economic activity affects a broad swath of firms and industries. Job destruction accelerates, often sharply, and job creation levels offor even decreases (figure 8.7). This decoupling leads to unemployment in formalized economies and under-employment in less formalized ones.87 In many countries, droughts, floods, or other natural disasters can have a similar impact. After the sources of the crisis dissipate, job creation picks up and unemployment or underemployment declines. The longer it takes for job creation to recover, the longer unemployment or under employment lasts."	n

Part 2 Ecological accounting for the current year.	"Part 2 Ecological accounting for the current year. Every year, global footprint network calculates this ""Earth Overshoot Day."" In 2010, Earth Overshoot Day occurred on August 21st, which means that from January 1, 2010 until August 21st, humanity demanded as much biocapacity - food, energy, waste absorption - as the Earth supplied during the whole of 2010. Earth Overshoot Day tends to take place earlier each year due to global population growth and rising resource consumption. Thus we are accumulating an ecological debt. Currently each person on Earth demands an average of a 2.7 gha Footprint, as compared to the biocapacity of 2.1 gha which are available per person. If all humans were to live like Europeans, we would need more than two Earths; at US-American consumption levels we would need almost five. The problem: we have only this, single planet. Somehow we must learn to live within our budget. Footprint calculations estimate that humanity moved into ecological overshoot in the 1980's or earlier. The last century was an era of We have just learned that human resource consumption was once within the limits of what the planet could provide, at least in our grandparents' days. During our parents' lifetimes, humanity has slipped into ecological overshoot. For the generation of people born in the 1980s and later, we've been living entirely during a time of growing ecological debt."	n

"Sweeping national security-related laws and regulations continued to be drafted and enacted, giving greater powers to the authorities to silence dissent, censor information and harass and prosecute human rights defenders. On 1 January the foreign NGO management law, whose provisions impeded independent operations of registered NGOs, came into effect.

These laws were part of a national security legal architecture introduced in 2014 - which also included the Anti-espionage Law, Criminal Law Amendment (9), National Security Law, Anti-terrorism Law and Cyber Security Law - and presented serious threats to the protection of human rights. The National Intelligence Law used similarly vague and overbroad concepts of national security, and granted effectively unchecked powers to national intelligence institutions with unclear roles and responsibilities. All lacked safeguards to protect against arbitrary detention and to protect the right to privacy, freedom of expression and other human rights.1 The draft Supervision Law, which opened for consultation in November, would, if enacted as is, legalize a new form of arbitrary detention, named liuzhi, and create an extrajudicial system with far-reaching powers with significant potential to infringe human rights.2 The authorities continued to use ""residential surveillance in a designated location"", a form of secret incommunicado detention that allowed the police to hold individuals for up to six months outside the formal detention system, without access to legal counsel of their choice, their families or others, and placed suspects at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. This form of detention was used to curb the activities of human rights defenders, including lawyers, activists and religious practitioners."	n
The business environment provides the basic public goods needed for the private sector to operate: infrastructure, access to finance, and sound regulation.	CHAPTER 9 A prerequisite for improved living standards is a policy environment conducive to private-sector-led job creation. Macro - economic stability, an enabling business environment, human capital, and the rule of law are all necessary ingredients. Adequate macroeconomic policies mitigate aggregate fluctuations and keep key relative prices aligned. The business environment provides the basic public goods needed for the private sector to operate: infrastructure, access to finance, and sound regulation. Human capital is formed through good nutrition, health, and education that builds human skills. The rule of law ensures the enforcement of contracts; it also includes the progressive realization of rights to avoid a situation where growth coexists with unacceptable forms of work. These are the fundamentals on which policies for jobs rest (figure 9.1).	n

Japan classifies fungicides applied pre-harvest as pesticides, and fungicides applied post-harvest as food additives.	Japan classifies fungicides applied pre-harvest as pesticides, and fungicides applied post-harvest as food additives. Japan's requirement that post-harvest fungicides be classified as food additives does not have a significant impact on domestic producers, as Japanese farmers do not generally apply fungicides after harvest. Japan previously required separate review processes for the pre-harvest and post-harvest uses of each fungicide. In 2018, Japan registered the first fungicide through a single review process that is intended to lead to more timely reviews. The United States remains concerned that Japan requires products treated with a post-harvest fungicide to be labeled at the point of sale with a statement indicating a list of the chemicals used, which may put U.S. products at a disadvantage relative to Japanese products by dampening demand for U.S. products. The United States will continue to work with Japan on these issues.	n

The field of study that men and women choose has an impact on their future lives, careers, incomes and roles in society. Many factors drive students' subject preferences in tertiary education, including performance in secondary education, perception of one's own abilities, social, economic and family background, career aspirations and labour market expectations. Genderbased stereotypes and gender differences in the balance between job and family responsibilities are also a significant factor.	n
This sometimes causes confusion, since it is the same term used in the research domain of entrepreneurial learning, which is about studying how entrepreneurs learn outside of the educational domain.	"9. The two most frequent terms used in this field are enterprise education and entrepreneurship education. The term enterprise education is primarily used in United Kingdom, and has been defined as focusing more broadly on personal development, mindset, skills and abilities, whereas the term entrepreneurship education has been defined to focus more on the specific context of setting up a venture and becoming self-employed (QAA, 2012, Mahieu, 2006). In United States, the only term used is entrepreneurship education (Erkkila, 2000). Some researchers use the longer term enterprise and entrepreneurship education (See for example Hannon, 2005), which is more clear but perhaps a bit unpractical. Sometimes enterprise and entrepreneurship education is discussed by using the term entrepreneurship education only, which however opens up for misunderstanding. Erkkila (2000) has proposed the unifying term entrepreneurial education as encompassing both enterprise and entrepreneurship education. This term will be used extensively in this report to avoid confusion. Further, the word ""student"" will in this report be used for learners on all levels of education, rather than adding the word ""pupil"" that some still use. For an overview of terms, see figure 1. 10. In Northern and Eastern Europe some additional terms are used. In Sweden and the Balkans the term entrepreneurial learning is often used as an equivalent to enterprise education (See for example Leffler and Falk-Lundqvist, 2013, Heder et al., 2011). This sometimes causes confusion, since it is the same term used in the research domain of entrepreneurial learning, which is about studying how entrepreneurs learn outside of the educational domain. Another set of terms used in Finland is internal entrepreneurship education and external entrepreneurship education (See for example Seikkula-Leino et al., 2010). Internal entrepreneurship education is a synonym to enterprise education, and external entrepreneurship education is a synonym to entrepreneurship education. Adding to the confusion here is the fact that internal entrepreneurship is sometimes used as a synonym to intrapreneurship, i.e. when acting entrepreneurially in an established organization (See for example Burgelman, 1983). 9 ."	n

Without the parts and necessary logistics to bring in materials and ship out products, many factories can barely produce or have no place to store the products.	Second, business-reopening permits and health regulations: Many SMEs struggle to meet the COVID-19 prevention requirements from the local government agencies. Some local governments also push the burden of COVID-19 prevention entirely on businesses. If one COVID-19 case cluster shows up in a business, the business will be closed for a longer period. Third, broken supply chain and logistics: Upstream SME closures are felt by downstream factories that are relying on the parts they produce for SMEs. Without the parts and necessary logistics to bring in materials and ship out products, many factories can barely produce or have no place to store the products. Most of the international shipping companies are slow in getting back to work because of the ongoing epidemic and various travel bans. Fourth, worries about revenue and cash flow: Because of the widespread low market demand, many small businesses have found that reopening only means they continue to pay rent and salaries without revenue. Many will pay staff minimal wages or lay off staff, which can further reduce demand.	n
My home became a place where both visions and cultures can grow and live together.	Migrants' inclusion in communities and countries does not require relinquishing one's identity or ties with communities and countries of origin. Migrants increasingly act as transnational actors,136 as explained by Daniel from Guatemala, who has been living for 30 years in Costa Rica: My home could be a Guatemalan territorial space but with windows and doors open to Costa Rica. My home became a place where both visions and cultures can grow and live together.	n

Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors.	The movement of labor out of agriculture has been facilitated by close urban proximity, resulting from Bangladesh's high population density. Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors. The ready- Urbanizing countries Urbanizing countries endowed with abundant unskilled labor have the potential to enter a virtuous jobs circle. The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities, especially in light manufacturing. These jobs may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and limited or negligible benefits, but in general they are preferable to jobs in agriculture. They can also be the entry point to a process of economic and technological upgrading that leads to better jobs in the future.34 Employment opportunities for the unskilled thus provide avenues out of poverty for large numbers of households. In countries in which women's jobs choices have been restricted, new employment opportunities in urbanizing economies can bring about important changes at the household and society levels.	n

Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries.	PROMER helped to create 240 enterprises, consolidate 665 enterprises, create 3,750 jobs, and teach 458 people to read. It usually takes enterprises 3 to 5 years to reach their full potential, and finding a niche in the economy can be critical for success. Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries. Apprentices trained informally by the baker opened 20 enterprises of their own and created about 84 jobs. Other rural enterprises were not as successful. Some developed products that succeeded in rural markets but not in urban markets because of high transport costs, poor marketing, or poor quality. Most entrepreneurs reported challenges in maintaining quality and continuous production. Rural enterprises had trouble finding an urban location in which to present their products, a result that highlights the problem of multiple constraints. Exhibitions have played a major role in bringing some rural products to a wider market, especially furniture, and have attracted better contracts that have led to modest job creation.	n

Women's groups (facilitated by CHWs) practising participatory learning and action, compared with usual care, have a positive impact on reducing neonatal mortality in low-resource settings (but no evidence of impact on reducing stillbirths) (31). Trained traditional birth attendants compared to untrained traditional birth attendants showed significant increases in safe delivery practices and appropriate referral knowledge and practice (32) and are associated with small but significant decreases in perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality due to birth asphyxia and pneumonia (32). However, another review (33) concludes that there is insufficient evidence to establish the potential of training of traditional birth attendants to improve perinatal and neonatal mortality. CHWs in Brazil have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing the frequency of child weighings (13).	n
"Finally, its subject matter must be accepted as ""patentable"" under law."	"What kinds of inventions can be protected? To achieve patent protection, an invention generally must be of practical use and must show an element of novelty--some new characteristic not known in the body of existing knowledge in its technical field. (This body of existing knowledge is called prior art.) The invention must show an inventive step (one that could not be deduced by a person with average knowledge of the technical field). Finally, its subject matter must be accepted as ""patentable"" under law. In many countries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, commercial methods, or methods for medical treatment (as opposed to medical products) are generally not patentable."	n

This would allow for a better understanding of women's economic vulnerability and of the co-shared responsibility of care work between women, men and the state.	Data on women's lack of cash labour income, such as those provided by ICF International based on Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), clearly illustrate the economic dependency of women on men, as a consequence of the gender division of labour in the domestic and market arenas (see Chapter 4 on Work). However, further statistical information is needed, including on the level of personal income from labour and other sources (such as government transfers) individually accessed. This would allow for a better understanding of women's economic vulnerability and of the co-shared responsibility of care work between women, men and the state.	n

A legal chronical since 2016 takes into account the growing importance of legal issues related to international migration and migration policy issues.	"The European Review of International Migration (REMI) is a specialised journal on international migration and inter-ethnic relations. Multidisciplinary (sociology, anthropology, demography, geography, history, political science, etc.), it publishes in French, English and Spanish in-depth articles of empirical or theoretical orientation, as well as research notes that present the first results of ongoing research. Each review number includes a thematic issue which is supplemented by varia. A legal chronical since 2016 takes into account the growing importance of legal issues related to international migration and migration policy issues. This reborn chronical is moderated by a group of specialised lawyers who are developing a network around issues such as international migration law (conventions, protocols), reception and protection conditions for unaccompanied minors, protection and promotion of the social rights of migrants, human rights as protection of migrants' rights, access to health, labour law for irregular migrants. 25 Articles cited in the journal editors' contribution can be found at: https://journals.openedition.org/remi/. 339WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 REMI celebrated its 30th anniversary by publishing a special issue entitled ""Renewing the Migration Issues"" (32/3-4 2016). This special volume brought together original and diversified contributions. In addition to the classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists. Through these exchanges, the function of scientific journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use of categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place of migration in multicultural societies are examined. Other articles deal with epistemological challenges by reporting on survey methods in an urban context (use of photography, sound recordings), the measurement of migratory flows, the mapping of migratory flows, the museography of migratory histories. Other articles analyse more current and topical situations: the United States' migration policy and the revival of the ""Silk Road"" between Asia and Europe."	n

Regulation of legitimate commerce to deny traffickers the chemicals they need is one of our most valuable tools in the battle against drug criminals.	"257. Measures to monitor trade in precursor chemicals and prevent their diversion into illicit channels are key components of all strategies to prevent or curb illicit manu facture of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 258. The mechanism for the monitoring of licit trade and the prevention of diversion is laid down in article 12 of the 1988 Convention, which has been complemented over the years by a series of resolutions at various levels of the international drug control system. The fundamental assumption underlying the system of international precursor control is that chemicals that can be used as drug precursors are licit commodities and that any transaction involving them is therefore presumed to be legitimate unless there is suspicion or evidence that the chemical concerned is to be used for illicit purposes. As such, ""the procurement of chemicals necessary to manufacture drugs is one of the few points ... where drug trafficking intersects with legitimate commerce. Regulation of legitimate commerce to deny traffickers the chemicals they need is one of our most valuable tools in the battle against drug criminals.""14 259. INCB has reviewed the achievements, progress and challenges of international precursor control in its annual reports on precursors.15 Over the past 25 years, since the entry into force of the 1988 Convention on 11 November 1990, States have succeeded, through the Convention and the oversight work undertaken by INCB, in substantially reducing the diversion of substances listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 Convention from international trade into illicit drug manufacture. After a quarter of a century, the 1988 Convention enjoys near universal adherence by States worldwide. Through its provisions and requirements, the Convention has served to establish, in 14 Chemical Action Task Force, Status Report for the 1992 Economic Summit (Washington, D.C., June 1992), p. 11. 15 SEE E/INCB/2011/4, E/INCB/2012/4, E/INCB/2013/4 and E/ INCB/2014/4."	n

With the application of manual sorting technology by the Philippine food industry, aflatoxin-free products are now commercially available in local and export markets.	Philippines: Filipino consumers (both here and abroad) are benefiting from greater availability in the market of healthy and safe (aflatoxin-free) peanut-based products. With the application of manual sorting technology by the Philippine food industry, aflatoxin-free products are now commercially available in local and export markets. In addition, Filipino consumers, especially children, are benefiting from the increased availability of Vitamin A-fortified peanut butter in local stores and supermarkets. Based on the consumers' survey, families were willing to pay extra for this product (about PhP1). As a spill-over, the food company that has the largest share of the peanut butter market, is now producing Vitamin A-fortified peanut butter under its own brand. Filipino entrepreneurs that own village-level, micro-and small-scale food enterprises are benefiting from the improved/optimized aflatoxin-free peanut-based products with improved packaging and product quality and longer shelf-life and lower production cost. The owners of these rural enterprises are mainly women.	n
It has been widely observed across history that as countries develop, the share of agriculture in the economy and employment declines (Figure2.1).	As households get richer, the demand for food as a share of total spending goes down and so does the demand from agriculture for labor. It has been widely observed across history that as countries develop, the share of agriculture in the economy and employment declines (Figure2.1). These structural and occupational transformations at the macro level reflect people's demand behavior at the micro level, that is, their relatively larger demand for non-food than for food as they get richer.15 As a result, the share of spending on food declines as incomes rise (widely known as Engel's Law), even though, in absolute terms, spending on food still increases. At the macro level this translates in a declining share of agriculture in GDP as countries develop, as well as a declining share of employment in agriculture.	n

Secondary education is provided for young people aged 12 to 18 in four branches: ASO (general), TSO (technical), KSO (artistic) and BSO (vocational), each divided into three 2-year periods.	Country Notes Primary education lasts for six years and leads to the Getuigschrift van Lager Onderwijs (Primary Education Certificate). Secondary education is provided for young people aged 12 to 18 in four branches: ASO (general), TSO (technical), KSO (artistic) and BSO (vocational), each divided into three 2-year periods. Pupils study as many subjects as possible during basic education. From the third and fourth year of secondary education, pupils can opt for a certain branch of study within ASO, TSO, KSO, or BSO. They may also follow a 7th year after the 6th TSO, KSO or BSO year, or study for a 5th year after the 4th BSO year. In the fifth and sixth years of secondary education pupils are offered either occupational training or higher education training. From age 15/16, pupils may also attend from 1 day/week to 15 weeks/year part-time secondary education, while having signed a part-time labor or apprenticeship contract.

While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education.	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.	n
Due to the strength of Bangladeshi manufacturing, most investment from the UK and the US is focused on this area.	"According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the largest investors in Bangladesh are Asian countries. The region generated 32% of total investment in 2008, led by Japan and Singapore. Asia is followed by the UK and the US with 21% and 20% shares respectively - a significant joint share for these two English-speaking countries. Due to the strength of Bangladeshi manufacturing, most investment from the UK and the US is focused on this area. This further encourages Bengalis to learn to speak English, as this is a typical requirement for someone working within the industry. On a company level, Microsoft invested more than US$45 million in 2008 in a software development site. This provides Microsoft with a pool of talent comprised of Bangladeshi students. These students in turn benefit from training, better facilities and work experience with Microsoft, with this facility accepting both existing students and graduates. Country offers potential despite difficulties Infrastructure deficiencies represent the primary deterrents to economic growth in Bangladesh. There have been many years of under-investment in the country. As a result, a large proportion of the population has to contend with very poor basic infrastructure. Furthermore, the lack of dependable power and water supply, as well as effective transport, represent a deterrent to many investors. Other impediments to foreign investment include political corruption. Despite this, Bangladesh offers huge opportunity: the country's stabilising political situation and numerous government incentives have helped build a positive climate for new investments.

Research findings are produced for, and disseminated to, different target audiences.	"Ideally, researchers create new knowledge that is supported by strong evidence and is useful for others. Research findings are produced for, and disseminated to, different target audiences. Traditional academic work can be highly technical and narrowly focused, although academic researchers are increasingly encouraged to disseminate their work beyond academic spheres.8 Researchers analysing policy-relevant issues are often keen to engage with policymakers to impart knowledge that can inform policy deliberations and help shape policymaking - this is especially the case with migration. Effective research contributions for policy audiences tend to take the form of short papers and blog articles, as well as policy workshops and interactive expert meetings. 6 GreyNet International, 2014. 7 In order to ensure, to the extent possible, that this chapter provides a comprehensive ""stand-alone"" overview of migration research and analysis in 2017 and 2018, we have drawn upon key background and context material included in the World Migration Report 2018 (chapter 4). 8 McAuliffe, 2016. 127WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 In academia, the main focus is on publishing, with some forms (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than others. A key strength of academic publications is that they have usually been peer reviewed by experts in the field, which typically enhances their quality. The growing number of publishing outlets is, however, characterized by a wide range of peer review standards. Arguably, one of the weaknesses of academic research is that the pressure to publish has contributed to a large increase in academic output in recent years, not always of high-quality material. Appendix A provides a summary of academic publishing, including details of peer-review processes, citations and impact assessment."	n

Improving the quality and relevance of the communal assets to generate wider and long-term effects is another challenge.	Several challenges face the MGNREGA program. Addressing leakage and transparency is one. The government has taken this challenge seriously, for example, through the adoption of biometric-unique identification cards. Improving the quality and relevance of the communal assets to generate wider and long-term effects is another challenge.

It also makes it possible to analyse the social conditions of production, expression and management of psychological suffering at the micro, meso and macro-social levels.	"Finally, the last dossier ""Mental health in international migration"" (34/2-3, 2018) coordinated by Veronique Petit and Simeng Wang is the first dossier that REMI has devoted to mental health. It is published at a time when migration policies in France and Europe, due to their deleterious effects, are undermining the rights, access to healthcare and health of many migrants. Articles provide empirical researches describing the use of care and therapeutic relationships in mental health for migrants at different points in their migration route. The mental health perspective renews the reading of the social relationships in which the migrant is inserted. It also makes it possible to analyse the social conditions of production, expression and management of psychological suffering at the micro, meso and macro-social levels. The methods of care (institutional, social, legal, health) for migrants diagnosed ""as having mental disorders, psychological difficulties or in a state of suffering"" link the effects of migration policies, the dynamics of reception and care of migrants, the organisation of care systems and the production of subjectivities and self-expression. 341world Migration Report 2020 Chapter 6 ."	n
Rice cultivation was introduced to the New World by early European settlers.	As a result of Europe's great Age of Exploration, new lands to the west became available for exploitation. Rice cultivation was introduced to the New World by early European settlers. The Portuguese carried it to Brazil and the Spanish introduced its cultivation to several locations in Central and South America. The first record for North America dates from 1685, when the crop was produced on the coastal lowlands and islands of what is now South Carolina. The crop may well have been carried to that area by slaves brought from the African continent. Early in the 18th century, rice spread to what is now Louisiana, but not until the 20th century was it produced in California's Sacramento Valley. The introduction into California corresponded almost exactly with the timing of the first successful crop in Australia's New South Wales.	n
Thus, food supply chains - at least those of domestically produced foods - have remained relatively undisrupted, so far preserving food supplies to both suburbs and informal settlements in urban areas and minimising price increases (Logan, 2020).	In Kenya, the movement of food supplies and other critical goods and services into and out of the areas under lockdown remains largely unhindered, albeit with transport operators subject to physical distancing, mask-wearing, and other measures to curb virus transmission. Delivery of supplies to wholesale distributors and supermarkets continues as normal and the essential railway cargo link between the port of Mombasa and Nairobi has been upgraded to several trains per day, thanks to the banning of passenger transport. Intercounty road cargo services have, by and large, been able to continue during daytime hours. Thus, food supply chains - at least those of domestically produced foods - have remained relatively undisrupted, so far preserving food supplies to both suburbs and informal settlements in urban areas and minimising price increases (Logan, 2020).	n

Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and by increasing privatization and deregulation.79 Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for the most part.	Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries. Rates of new firm registration are low in most countries in the region.83 And even when they do get started, small firms face barriers in growing into sizable companies. The vast majority of Tunisian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them are one-person entities, and only 0.4 percent have 100 workers or more. But these large firms account for more than one-third of all jobs, more than all the one-person firms combined. A study of their dynamics over a decade shows that micro-and small firms hardly ever become large firms. Moreover, one-person firms only very rarely graduate into the small size category, and many are likely to shut down.84 While countries with high youth unemployment may face a large youth bulge or education quality issues, problems are often on the demand side, with limited competition reducing employment opportunities, especially for highly skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased. This prospect is unlikely to materialize, however, as long as political connections remain more important than entrepreneurial capacity to enter they would make a major dent in the aggregate unemployment rate is unclear. Better matches between jobseekers and employment opportunities would result in large increases in total employment only if there were many unfilled vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle East and North Africa. Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and by increasing privatization and deregulation.79 Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for the most part.80 The problem is similar with training programs. Educated youth have the capacity to learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could even provide on-the-job training as needed. But training may not change aspirations.	n

Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants' journeys.	The IJMBS contributed to the understanding of how the logics of borders are confronted by migrant realities and everyday experiences. Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants' journeys. Being in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move. Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities. In particular, there has been a mounting pressure on the first countries of asylum to double efforts to locally integrate refugees they are hosting. However these countries struggle to meet the social and economic needs of refugees who often face discrimination. As described in an article, the desire to move on with their lives and escape the interminable temporariness in Turkey propelled some Syrian refugees to engage in secondary movements throughout the EU, despite the risks of the journey. For similar reasons, the vast majority of one million refugees who landed in Greece and Italy in 2015-2016, then engaged in secondary movements to escape the temporary status and the exploitative economies of transit. Another contribution shed light on the situation of asylum seekers confined in Indonesia and who hope to be resettled in Australia. It demonstrated that limbo in transit encouraged migrants to agree to assisted voluntary return, in many cases, to places where they may face persecution.	n

Among those employed, the material, nonmaterial, and even subjective characteristics of jobs can all have an impact on well-being.	Because economies grow as high-productivity jobs are created and low-productivity jobs disappear, the relationship between productivity gains and job creation is not mechanical. In the medium term, employment trends align closely with trends in the size of the labor force, so growth is truly jobless in very few cases. In the short term, however, innovations can be associated with either increases or decreases in em- Beyond their fundamental and immediate contribution to earnings, jobs also affect other dimensions of well-being, including mental and physical health. Not having a job undermines life satisfaction, especially in countries where wage employment is the norm and where the lack of opportunities translates into open unemployment rather than underemployment. Among those employed, the material, nonmaterial, and even subjective characteristics of jobs can all have an impact on well-being.37 Other features such as workplace safety, job security, learning and advancement opportunities, and health and social protection benefits are valued by workers. But relatively few jobs offer these advantages in developing countries.	n
Some basic questions are addressed, such as who operates in the sector and why, what are the most common types of activities, do these activities persist over time?	This chapter discusses employment and productivity in the nonagricultural household enterprise sector in Coted'Ivoire, as well as the scope for policies to support it. The chapter starts with an overall description of household enterprises. Some basic questions are addressed, such as who operates in the sector and why, what are the most common types of activities, do these activities persist over time? In light of very large heterogeneity in productivity, the chapter then addresses constraints for individuals to create or operate 73 For Coted'Ivoire, official definition of small and medium enterprises is provided in Loi No 2014-140 du 24 Mars 2014 on National Policy Orientation for small and medium enterprises. Chapter II, Article 5 of this law provides the definition of microenterprises. household enterprises, as well as determinants of household enterprises' productivity. The analysis is primarily based on quantitative micro data, but also supported with complementary qualitative data on household enterprises collected as part of the study (see Box 4.2 for a discussion of data sources). Thefinal section looks at different policy entry points for the sector and analyses the interplay of the different actors (household enterprise operators, policy makers, and other stakeholders).	n

In short, challenges abound.	In short, challenges abound. While, ideally, protected areas established to conserve inland water ecosystems will encompass entire catchments, more typically innovative combinations of protected areas and other strategies will need to be applied within an IRBM framework. Existing protected areas designated and designed to protect terrestrial ecosystems no doubt confer some benefits to wetland biodiversity through landscape management, but there are significant opportunities to provide enhanced protection. Designs for new protected areas can and should include inland water considerations from the outset to achieve better integration. The following pages provide introductory guidelines for how the range of different management approaches in protected areas represented by the categories can better assist inland wetland conservation.	n
The papers encompass a range of topics, including the impact of technical innovation through new varieties, the pricing and marketing of agricultural products (peanut), optimizing farm planning and poverty levels, technical efficiencies in peanut production/processing, and a range of descriptive analyses.	Annex1 : Socio-economics, Gender and Policy Projects - 61 - Knowledge of methods used in conducting economic analysis was gained through the use of the new software and interactive exchange visits to Alabama and Bulgaria. Plans for producing publications were developed. The PIs jointly arrived at the realization that analytical tools necessary for this project would need to be rebuilt based on assumptions appropriate for a noncentrally controlled economy. Also, assumptions relative to farm unit size and managerial capabilities of the new farm owners would need to be retooled. Hence, technology transfer and technology transformation would result from the CRSP endeavor. ENEA was enabled to inaugurate better collection and use of farm level data, including the use of coding and data entry. This process became repeatable on a yearly basis and the focus shifted to a more rigorous system of data analysis. This new capability at data management has been used to increase the production of technical papers to disseminate the results. The papers encompass a range of topics, including the impact of technical innovation through new varieties, the pricing and marketing of agricultural products (peanut), optimizing farm planning and poverty levels, technical efficiencies in peanut production/processing, and a range of descriptive analyses. On the U.S. side of the technical benefits/achievements ledger, there were several outcomes: The University of Connecticut (UCONN) PI and his assistants gained additional experience in collecting, managing and analyzing data in situations with developing country conditions imposed. Other faculty at UCONN gained experience from working with and exposure to richer socio-economic data from the developing country setting.	n
The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23) are by far the highest-paying sectors.	This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across sectors, firm types, and over time. It also explores how the wage growth path is related to labor productivity and other firm-level characteristics. The analysis helps answer the following questions: (a) Are wages higher in large or small firms, firms creating jobs versus non-job creators? (b) Do wages increase with productivity, including productivity within firms and across sector? (c) How does this wage-productivity relationship vary by the extent of market competition? First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in wages across and within sectors, even after accounting for skill composition. Not surprisingly, most sectors pay better than agriculture. Somewhat unexpectedly, the food manufacturing sector has one of the lowest average wage. The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23) are by far the highest-paying sectors. Those in the public sector (75) are also among the highest-paying jobs, lending support to the argument that in many developing countries including Coted'Ivoire, high public wages might impose a wage floor effect for skilled workers in the private sector. This observation is consistent with the finding in Chapter1 that for the more educated --those at least upper-secondary education --public jobs are more prevalent that private wage employment in the formal sector.	n
In reality the recognition by a protected area management authority of protected areas owned/managed by indigenous communities is often linked to a community's response to an external threat to their traditional ownership/management.	In reality the recognition by a protected area management authority of protected areas owned/managed by indigenous communities is often linked to a community's response to an external threat to their traditional ownership/management. Becoming part of a network can help secure rights and ensure continuity of livelihoods and traditions. This process of 'formal' recognition can simplify the process of ensuring a site meets the definition of a protected area, assigning the category and having the site recorded within national and international data on protected area. The Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) of Australia, for example, used the categories system from the onset; the advantages of this were perceived by all parties. As IUCN recorded in a review of the use of the categories in 2004, 'Indigenous groups ... liked the idea of adopting an internationally recognised system because they felt it reinforced their status as legitimate protected area managers and thus engaged them into an internationally significant agenda, something they have struggled to achieve in Australia. From other stakeholders' perspective (i.e. government and NGOs) the IUCN category system gave the IPA concept more credibility and parity with the mainstream protected area system and so their criticisms were somewhat diminished. From the perspective of the Commonwealth government, who are the funders and promoters of the initiative, it also gave greater confidence that IPAs were worth investing in with scarce conservation dollars' (Bishop et al., 2004, pages 142-143). Other examples of the use of the protected areas concept to maintain traditional human societies can be found in Stolton and Dudley, 2010.	n

WHO guidelines (19) promote the establishment of CHW programmes as an integral part of primary health care, demonstrated to be feasible even in low-to middle-income countries.	Community-based TB activities are found all along the pathway of TB prevention and care, and can positively influence the quality and outcome of health services offered. They are delivered primarily by community health workers (CHWs) and community volunteers (CVs)a who are drawn from within the community, and thus are both accessible and acceptable to community members. In the context of the SDGs and UHC, primary health care is receiving greater attention. A growing number of countries are taking steps to absorb cadres of CHWs into the workforce of national health systems. WHO guidelines (19) promote the establishment of CHW programmes as an integral part of primary health care, demonstrated to be feasible even in low-to middle-income countries. Harnessing the full potential of CHWs has the potential to remove barriers to care and promote equitable access to health services at the community level.	n

Indicators of environmental concerns could be incorporated into these existing models to add an environmental component.	This overview calls for a more comprehensive analysis of the environmental effects of the life cycle of tobacco, including cigarette production, trade and disposal. One way to do this is to use economic modelling to include environmental costs in the overall costs of the tobacco trade. Another would be to assess the economic viability of crops other than tobacco with a lesser environmental impact. To achieve the first, a variant of a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis of the effect of the tobacco trade on the environment could be created. Indicators of environmental concerns could be incorporated into these existing models to add an environmental component. By using the results of CGE modelling (alongside established cost-benefit methodologies), environmental effects could be costed (while offsetting other effects) in order to arrive at a figure on the net costs of tobacco and cigarette production that takes account of environmental impact.	n

It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member states' policies relating to food and safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection, and labeling) as well as animal and plant health and imported pests and diseases. Notably, the SPS Agreement cites Codex's food safety standards, guidelines, and recommendations for facilitating international trade and protecting public health.	n
First, given the forecasted growth in T&T in the coming decade, far more investment is required in infrastructure in order to build capacity to welcome more visitors while adequately serving the needs of citizens.	Critical checkpoints for the industry Despite improvements across region, subregion and income level, a number of challenges remain for the T&T industry. First, given the forecasted growth in T&T in the coming decade, far more investment is required in infrastructure in order to build capacity to welcome more visitors while adequately serving the needs of citizens. For example, despite the growth in air travel and openness, global average perceptions of air transport infrastructure quality have improved at a far slower rate (at a global average 1.4% and 0.4% for high-income economies since the last report), and airport density statistics have fallen. In addition, while some progress has been made in improving ground and port infrastructure, especially in Asia-Pacific, the overall growth trend for Ground and Port Infrastructure (pillar 11) has been slower. Furthermore, from a global perspective, perceptions of the quality and efficiency of ground transport infrastructure and services have on average remained near stagnant. Consequently, the risk of future air and ground transport bottlenecks is likely to rise, hurting both the industry and local economies.	n

The land consists of rolling plains dissected by valleys formed by upper reaches of the Volta River. Agriculture, mainly at a subsistence level, makes up almost the entire GDP, although only about 13% of the land is arable. Further, substantial desertification has occurred as a result of previous inappropriate farming techniques used for peanuts and cotton for export. Deforestation has also been rampant, resulting in a lack of fuel wood.	n

The Mahanadi Delta was selected because it has a dense and growing population that is reliant upon subsistence agriculture, facing pressure over available land for farming, and frequently impacted by climate hazards. We specifically targeted Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara districts because they span the majority of the delta's extent and are the sites of recent hazard impacts including the 1999 Super Cyclone, Cyclone Phailin in 2013, and floods in 2008.	n

As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case.	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).	n

Justice systems should act as facilitators of investment and economic growth, not obstacles.	Justice systems should act as facilitators of investment and economic growth, not obstacles. Doing Business data suggest that specialized training of lawyers and judges is an area that could benefit from more attention and resources worldwide. Even where continuing training and education are offered, they are seldom mandatory or practical to the cases assigned and often exacerbate judges' lack of expertise. However, imposing standardized mandatory training is not an adequate solution. Setting minimum standards should not come at the cost of motivation. Instead, integrating training plans into annual judicial performance evaluations (or otherwise creating incentives to continue learning) are opportunities to enhance judicial systems' indirect but significant role in investment. a.

The main conditions causing maternal death, including post-partum haemorrhage, sepsis, obstructed labour, complications of unsafe abortions and hypertensive disorders, can be managed when well-trained staff and adequate equipment are available to provide the necessary care, including emergency obstetric care.

These products include higher-value goods that are sensitive for the Israeli agricultural sector, such as dairy products, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, almonds, wine, juice, and some processed foods.	U.S. agricultural exports that do not enter duty free under World Trade Organization (WTO), FTA, or ATAP provisions face barriers, such as high tariffs and a complicated TRQ system. These products include higher-value goods that are sensitive for the Israeli agricultural sector, such as dairy products, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, almonds, wine, juice, and some processed foods. According to industry estimates, the elimination of levies on processed foods, including a broad range of dairy products, could result in increased 276 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS sales by U.S. companies in the range of $30 million to $55 million per year. U.S. producers of apples, pears, cherries, frozen vegetables, and stone fruits estimate that the elimination of Israeli trade barriers would lead to an increase of up to $15 million per year in export sales of these products. Stakeholders estimate that full free trade in agriculture could also result in significant increases in U.S. cheese exports to Israel. Similarly, stakeholders estimate that removing tariffs on food product inputs used by U.S.-based restaurant chains operating in Israel could save these chains millions of dollars annually and lead to their expansion in Israel.	n
Apart from ready-made garments, few sectors have grown substantially in Resource-rich countries Investments in extractive industries can represent a sizable fraction of a developing country's GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export revenue, but they do not create many jobs.	Diverse jobs agendas 199 Bangladesh.39 The pharmaceutical industry has developed, and the different pattern of development there relative to that of the garment industry is intriguing. But the high skill levels required by the pharmaceutical sector and other higher value-added export sectors are unlikely to make them a source of jobs for the masses of youth with only primary education. have been supportive through family planning and social protection. Urbanizing countries like Bangladesh have the potential to exploit several spillovers. But a key challenge for them is to find a way to move up the value-added chain and diversify manufacturing exports. Apart from ready-made garments, few sectors have grown substantially in Resource-rich countries Investments in extractive industries can represent a sizable fraction of a developing country's GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export revenue, but they do not create many jobs. The number of people at work during the construction phase may be sufficient to generate dynamism at the local level, but once the mines and fields are in operation, employment goes down dramatically. Perhaps the most extreme example is the liquid natural gas project in Papua New Guinea. The investment cost of the project exceeded twice the country's GDP at project startup, and the project may lead to double-digit growth rates for many years. But it is unlikely to generate more than 1,000 direct jobs in the longer term (table 6.1).	n

Its prevalence is increasing in development discourses and policy (DFID 2011).	"Climate hazards affect agriculture through both short-and longterm adverse impacts on economic growth and human well-being (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Barrett and Santos 2014, Hsiang and Jina 2014). These impacts are heterogeneous; some groups, e.g. households, communities, or countries, face higher probabilities of exposure, some are better able to resist shocks, and some are better able to recover. At the same time, hazard impacts on agriculture can reinforce poverty traps, and heighten risk. In the absence of markets for insurance and credit, these impacts can lead farmers to choose low-return agricultural technologies to maintain stable livelihoods, often at levels below the poverty line (Carter et al. 2007, Dercon and Christiaensen 2011, Barrett et al. 2015). Repeated exposure to climate hazards can undermine current and future coping capacity (Bene et al. 2016a, Duncan et al. 2017). In this context of growing awareness of the damaging interaction between climate hazards, response and coping capacity, and short-and long-term growth, the policy of ""resilience building"" has emerged as a possible antidote. Its prevalence is increasing in development discourses and policy (DFID 2011)."	n

Using the same average capital returns as a proxy, it appears that manufacturing and services industries associated with mining, computer and other equipment, and financial intermediation (ISIC 12, 30, 32, 33, 50, 67, and 72) are the most financially constrained. The agribusiness sector (ISIC 15), on the other hand, appears to be less constrained. Similarly, capital constraints also vary by firm size. In general, access to finance appears more binding for smaller firms. However, in contrast to suggestions from other studies, formal micro firms might not be the most financially constrained. Using our proxy, firms between 5-20 employees will benefit most from capital reallocation. Still, as Chapter4 highlights, capital constraints are also the most binding constraints for household enterprise.	n
The agreement covers a wide range of products, including bread and baked goods, breakfast cereals, chocolate and other candies, ice cream, pasta, pizza, soups, and sauces.	Norway has continued to dismantle tariffs on industrial products on a unilateral basis. Norway's Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on nonagricultural products averages 0.5 percent, and more than 95 percent of industrial tariff lines are currently duty free. Norway bound its agricultural tariffs in 1995 as part of its WTO commitments. Tariffication of agricultural nontariff barriers as a result of the Uruguay Round led to the replacement of several quotas on agricultural products with high ad valorem or specific tariffs. According to the WTO, in 2017 Norway's most favored nation applied tariff was 42.1 percent for agricultural goods and 0.5 percent for nonagricultural goods. Although the EEA accord does not generally apply to agricultural products, it includes provisions on raw material price compensation that are meant to increase trade in processed food. Norway has a special agreement within the EEA framework that results in Norway applying a preferential duty on EU processed food products. The agreement covers a wide range of products, including bread and baked goods, breakfast cereals, chocolate and other candies, ice cream, pasta, pizza, soups, and sauces. Such preferential access for EU suppliers disadvantages U.S. exporters of these processed foods. 372 | foreign trade barriers .	n
How do you categorise World Heritage sites and Biosphere reserves?	How do you categorise World Heritage sites and Biosphere reserves? All new and most existing natural World Heritage sites are protected areas and comply with the IUCN definition of a protected area. So are some cultural sites, especially World Heritage Cultural Landscapes. Some countries have older natural World Heritage sites that are not regarded as protected areas or contain parts that are outside protected areas. Categories should be assigned in a similar manner to other protected areas whilst noting the special emphasis that is given to managing to maintain the site's outstanding universal value as the basis for inscription. The IUCN definition should equally be applied to Man and Biosphere Reserves as part of the category assignment process. In most cases this would apply to core areas and in many cases also to buffer zones (often with different categories); however, transition zones are often managed for purposes of sustainable use and may not comply (see 2008 Guidelines, Chapter 7, for discussion of the categories and international designations).

They help spread key messages focusing on hygiene and infection prevention, including handwashing using soap, social distancing, and how to benefit from the Koran when in lockdown at home.	The most comprehensive approach, at least on paper, is in Bangladesh, where the response plan underscores the roles of a range of actors - including key influencers at national and local level (community leaders, religious leaders, health workers, community volunteers, etc.) and local networks (women's groups, youth groups, business groups, traditional healers, etc.) - particularly on communication of key messages, with the need to 'speak with one voice' to avoid panic. (c) Maintains 42 The role of religious leaders has been important and varied, with a very positive role played by them in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda. In Uganda, religious leaders have actively supported the government's lockdown, banning church and mosque gatherings for a month and instead providing services over the radio. The situation is similar in Kenya, where Muslim leaders are actively supporting the response - even by shutting Nairobi's biggest mosque, Jamia Mosque, during Ramadan, the first time it has been shut in the 95 years of the mosque's history - and establishing guidelines on safe burials (WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), 2020). In Bangladesh, about 500,000 Imams and religious leaders are disseminating information about COVID-19 nationwide. They help spread key messages focusing on hygiene and infection prevention, including handwashing using soap, social distancing, and how to benefit from the Koran when in lockdown at home. This is particularly important in rural and hard-to-reach areas where people do not have access to radio, television, or newspapers, so the mosque megaphone can play a critically important role (UNICEF, 2020).	n

The flow of travellers is assisted by excellent air transport (3rd) and tourist services (4th) infrastructure and increasingly efficient ground transport (17th to 6th).	Selected Country/Economy Analysis The United States is the top scorer in the Americas, moving up one place to rank fifth globally. The combination of the overall size of its economy and T&T competitiveness helps explain why the country has the largest T&T GDP in the world, accounting for over one-fifth of the global total. In comparison to the global average, one of the United States' greatest advantages comes from its natural (5th) and cultural (12th) resources, which also helps separate it from many other developed nations in the rankings. The country is well known for its numerous World Heritage natural sites (3rd) and extensive wildlife (13th), which drive nature-based tourist arrivals (35th). The flow of travellers is assisted by excellent air transport (3rd) and tourist services (4th) infrastructure and increasingly efficient ground transport (17th to 6th). However, the primary reason for the United States' improvement is its better enabling environment (25th to 16th), including enhancements to already-strong business environment (16th to 4th) and human resource and labour market (13th to 1st) areas. Combined with solid ICT readiness (18th), these factors help encourage T&T investment, utilization of digital services and business travel.	n

There is a fair degree of market orientation.	There is a fair degree of market orientation. Four in five smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in five reporting to sell their complete harvest (Figure3.3). In other words, most farmers engage with the market and have moved well beyond farming for subsistence only. It also suggests that the number of 55 The labor questions of the agriculture module in the ENSETE 2013 only cover the last 3 months and so these statistics might suffer from underestimation and seasonality. Also, the use of hired and unpaid labor is only expressed in number of persons used, not in number of person days. Nonetheless, the number of unpaid persons used on the farm suggests that labor exchange (unpaid non-household members working on the farm) is non-negligible (and almost on par with hired labor use), suggesting that it is important to keep it in mind when calculating labor productivity measures, albeit less so from the perspective of jobs generation. The surveys do not provide additional information regarding the motivation, the precise extent or the individual characteristics of those involved in this unpaid laborexchange.	n

On the whole, the education of the worker and the circumstances he or she was born into play important roles in explaining inequalities in access to jobs, and the role of education is especially important for regular employment in the formal sector.50 * * * The interaction of jobs and social cohesion is not linear or simple to disentangle.	Similar analysis for 18 countries in Latin America using the 1990 Latinobarometro survey confirms these findings. On the whole, the education of the worker and the circumstances he or she was born into play important roles in explaining inequalities in access to jobs, and the role of education is especially important for regular employment in the formal sector.50 * * * The interaction of jobs and social cohesion is not linear or simple to disentangle. This is an emerging area for further research across disciplines. The effect of jobs on trust and civic engagement at the individual level suggests that exchanges The exclusionary nature of networks is highlighted by the experience of migrants moving from rural areas to cities. Migrants often choose destinations where they have connections. But if they do not, they can be uprooted from family and community ties that provide economic and social support, including access to jobs. They may also lack the information needed to integrate into their new destinations. Migrants moving across borders or regions, internally displaced persons or refugees fleeing from conflict or returning after a peace agreement, and soldiers demobilized after conflict may be particularly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportunities. This is a concern in conflict situations as well as in contexts of structural transformation, when massive numbers of people move from rural to urban areas.45 Networks also do not reach many among the self-employed, especially home-based workers who work in isolation and domestic workers who lack opportunities to interact with others.	n

International Openness (3 indicators): Developing a competitive T&T sector internationally requires a certain degree of openness and travel facilitation.	The T&T Policy and Enabling Conditions subindex captures specific policies or strategic aspects that impact the T&T industry more directly and includes 4 pillars: 6. Prioritization of Travel and Tourism (6 indicators): The extent to which the government prioritizes the T&T sector has an important impact on T&T competitiveness. By making clear that the sector is of primary concern, the government can channel funds to essential development projects and coordinate the actors and resources necessary to develop the sector. Signalling the stability of government policy can affect the sector's ability to attract further private investment. The government can also play an important role in directly attracting tourists through national marketing campaigns. This pillar includes measures of government spending, effectiveness of marketing campaigns and country branding, and the completeness and timeliness of providing T&T data to international organizations, as this indicates the importance that a country assigns to its T&T sector. 7. International Openness (3 indicators): Developing a competitive T&T sector internationally requires a certain degree of openness and travel facilitation. Restrictive policies such as cumbersome visa requirements diminish tourists' willingness to visit a country, and indirectly reduce the availability of key services. Components measured in this pillar include the openness of the bilateral air service agreements which the government has entered, which impacts the availability of air connections to the country, and the number of regional trade agreements in force, which proxies the extent to which it is possible to provide world class tourism services. 8. Price Competitiveness (4 indicators): Lower costs related to travel in a country increase its attractiveness for many travellers as well as for investing in the T&T sector. Among the aspects of price competitiveness taken into account in this pillar are airfare ticket taxes and airport charges, which can make flight tickets much more expensive; the relative cost of hotel accommodation; the cost of living, proxied by purchasing power parity; and fuel price costs, which directly influence the cost of travel.	n
Sectors that are relatively more capital intensive tend to be more productive.	Sectors that are relatively more capital intensive tend to be more productive. The heterogeneity in household enterprises is reflected by strong variation in productivity across types of activities. Sectors such as transport, sales, or bar and restaurant activities are more productive than trade (Figure4.14). These sectors are generally more capital intensive. For instance, operators in sales (for example, retails of personal articles, cereals, clothes, and so on) are estimated to be, on average, between 23 to 28 percent more productive than those trading alcohol, juice, and fruits. These estimates are highly statistically significant (Figure4.15; Table C.3, in AnnexC).	n
As the area under cultivation declines relative to the size of the population, producing sufficient food becomes a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place.	Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries, because poor people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.8 Since 1700, virtually every example of mass poverty reduction has actually begun with an increase in agricultural productivity.9 Constraints on agricultural growth vary depending on the availability of land relative to the availability of farm labor. Compared with other areas of the developing world, SubSaharan Africa was traditionally seen as a continent of ample land and scarce labor. While that may still be true in some areas, it no longer applies to countries in the south and east of the continent. In Mozambique, the average farm size is less than 1.5 hectares. As the area under cultivation declines relative to the size of the population, producing sufficient food becomes a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place. In many agrarian economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have yet to occur. Unlike many parts of Asia, where the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield and the poverty incidence has declined, cereal yield has remained low and poverty incidence high in these Sub-Saharan countries (figure 6.1). Some Asian economies, such as Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar, face similar challenges.	n

There is a fair degree of market orientation in agriculture in Coted'Ivoire.	Export crops make up about a quarter of total agricultural output, with food crops making up the rest (75 percent). There is a fair degree of market orientation in agriculture in Coted'Ivoire. Four in five smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in five reporting that they sell their complete harvest. Farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively well endowed with land. Given high land/labor ratios and little mechanization, hiring labor is common, often migrant labor to make up for family labor shortages. Use of non-family labor is especially high on cotton, rice, and cashew (grown in the north), the production of which has been expanding over the past 5 years.	n
The capacity of ecosystems to produce biological materials useful to humans and to absorb waste materials generated by humans, using current technological means.	The capacity of ecosystems to produce biological materials useful to humans and to absorb waste materials generated by humans, using current technological means. A material is biologically useful if it is used in economic processes which can change from year to year (e.g. use of corn (maize) stover for ethanol production would increase the biocapacity of maize cropland since, in addition to corn cobs, the stover would also become a useful material). The biocapacity of an area (in global hectares) is calculated by multiplying the actual physical area by the yield factor and the appropriate equivalence factor.	n

Patient accumulation of human capital and sustained growth have paid off.	The key is to build formal institutions and programs that are not too costly and that are valued by workers. The jobs agenda of formalizing economies is closely linked, then, to the development of effective regulation and social protection systems. moving away from the current contributory systems toward the funding of benefits from general tax revenue.104 This reform would certainly expand the number of beneficiaries, but whether it would encourage firms to formalize is a matter of intense debate, especially in Mexico (box 6.7).105 So far, few countries have managed to substantially reduce informality. Rapid growth and strengthening institutions in Brazil and Chile have made them recent exceptions. In both cases, changes in labor market regulation have had limited effect. Patient accumulation of human capital and sustained growth have paid off. But strengthened rule of law, effective policies, and a better perception of the role of the state have also helped.	n

As such, they also reflect life cycle issues unrelated to the structural transformation (such as youth starting to work offthe farm before returning to farming in attendance of access to land) and they should be taken as upper bounds. Subtracting the difference in agricultural participation across age cohorts among the three least-developed countries, which are still at the cusp of their structural transformation (Ethiopia, Malawi, and Niger), as an indicator of a 'normal' age gradient, would reduce Coted'Ivoire's age gradient to about 10 percentage points (from 14.6 in 2008).	n

To enable sustainable development, scientists, politicians and members of civil society will have to take action, individually and collectively, to protect the Earth's diversity of ecosystems, genes and species, while maintaining a high quality of life for humans.	"Suggestions for further work: What changes occur when biological diversity decreases? Part 2 Ecological accounting humans and wild living plants and animals will increase. The question will become: Who gets the fish - the sea lion or the human? Can declining population trends in species be reversed? If we wanted to put a full stop to human activities that lead to endangered and extinct species, we would need to make drastic changes in our living habits. It would likely require taking portions of land used by humans, and returning them to their natural state. It would also require changing our eating habits significantly. We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions, and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort. Biological diversity is not equally distributed throughout the world. Many biodiversity hotspots lie in Central America and western Amazonia, in the Cape area of South Africa, and in the mountains and plains of East Africa. Other regions rich in biodiversity include the coastal regions and islands of the Mediterranean, Southwest China, and the bordering areas from Burma to Vietnam. Large parts of Madagascar also belong to this list, as do numerous islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. When faced with the extinction of valuable biodiversity, is it sufficient to view the Earth exclusively as potentially productive area for humans? Or is our planet more than a source of raw materials for human consumption and a carbon dioxide sink for human waste? To enable sustainable development, scientists, politicians and members of civil society will have to take action, individually and collectively, to protect the Earth's diversity of ecosystems, genes and species, while maintaining a high quality of life for humans.

Nearly half of entrepreneurs managing the 50 largest manufacturing firms in Ethiopia began their careers in trading companies, thereby learning about the market and what it takes to meet demand.	A substantial number of experiments have been conducted in recent years, providing evidence of both successes and failures of management training interventions. Some patterns emerge from a systematic review of the available evidence. To be successful, management training must be kept simple, appropriate teaching materials must be available, and the training must such as numeracy and literacy, as well as social skills. A vast literature highlights the importance of entrepreneurs' schooling as a determinant of firm growth, employment, and efficiency.74 Russian and Chinese business owners have more entrepreneurs in their families and among childhood friends than otherwise similar individuals, suggesting that social environment also matters.75 Learning can also happen through jobs. Nearly half of entrepreneurs managing the 50 largest manufacturing firms in Ethiopia began their careers in trading companies, thereby learning about the market and what it takes to meet demand.76 A large number of founders and leading entrepreneurs in the light manufacturing industries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were initially traders or employees in the marketing division of large enterprises.77 Integration in supply chains with larger, often foreign, firms, is receiving much attention as a potential source of knowledge transfers.78 Indian entrepreneurs returning from Silicon Valley made Bangalore a hub of the information technology industry.

In March, LNA-affiliated fighters were filmed killing captured SCBR fighters, a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime. In August, the ICC issued a warrant for the arrest of Mahmoud el-Werfelli for alleged war crimes committed while he was field commander of the Special Forces Brigade (Al-Saiqa) affiliated to the LNA, including for involvement in the March killings. A number of mass graves were uncovered in Benghazi between February and October. On at least four occasions, groups of bodies were found in different parts of the city with their hands bound behind their backs, and in some cases blindfolded with signs of torture and execution-style killing. In August, the bodies of six unidentified men were found in a rubbish bin in the eastern Benghazi neighbourhood of Shabneh. The bodies showed signs of torture and had bullet wounds in the head and chest. On 26 October, the bodies of 36 men were found on a deserted road south of the town of al-Abyar, including a 71-year-old Sufi sheikh who had 242 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 been abducted in August, and a medical student.	n

INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and/or sustainable intensification.	Given the need to stabilize the rainfed upland environment and the success of the NERICAs, WARDA implements its research strategy for this environment along the following four lines: * Increased use of NERICA seed in farmers' fields. PVS work in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire has shown the potential of NERICAs in farmers' fields. In the coming decade, WARDA will expand the number of farmers exposed to NERICAs throughout the region through PVS. * The development of new inter-and intraspecific rice cultivars. WARDA will enlarge the gene pool for uplands using advanced and more traditional breeding tools. In addition, participatory plant breeding will provide farmer input into WARDA's breeding program and speed up the identification of favorable plant material with resistance to drought and soil acidity. * Validation and dissemination of integrated natural resource management (INRM) practices. INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and/or sustainable intensification. Building on previous achievements in the development of N-fixing fallow legumes and the introduction of a modest use of fertilizer, including rock-phosphate, emphasis will be placed on integrated biophysical and socioeconomic assessment of these technologies and the formulation of adequate baskets of technologies. * Creating an enabling environment for the scaling-up of NERICAs and INRM practices. For the varietal component, a focus will be placed on community-based seed supply systems to address weak seed multiplication systems for farmers of rainfed rice. For INRM, the focus will be on strengthening the capabilities of rice development stakeholders in applying research results.	n

In line with official definitions, the working-age population is classified into two groups: active and inactive. The active population is further divided into employed and unemployed. An individual is considered employed if she works at least one hour over the previous seven days. An individual is considered unemployed if she works less than one hour in the last seven days, is actively looking for work, and is available to work in the next 15 days.

For example, Oxfam, as co-leader of the IASC Gender Reference Group, has implemented new policies and programs as part of its feminist approach to humanitarian emergencies (Metcalfe-Hough et al. 2019, 26).	Some efforts are underway to better integrate women's organizations in the LHL space and to ensure that locally led humanitarian action better reflects the work of women's organizations. In a recent progress report on the localization workstream of the Grand Bargain, UN Women added two activities to the work plan: research on gender-transformative humanitarian interventions and development of a guidance note on gender-responsive localization (Coconveners' Summary of Progress 2018, 4). The report also noted that 3 out of 10 local organizations invited to the localization workstream are women's organizations (from Kenya, Liberia, and Nepal). Several signatories of the Grand Bargain have also committed to furthering gender equality in the humanitarian system. For example, Oxfam, as co-leader of the IASC Gender Reference Group, has implemented new policies and programs as part of its feminist approach to humanitarian emergencies (Metcalfe-Hough et al. 2019, 26).

According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the expansion of educational opportunities over the past several decades has clearly affected girls, although this has not been a result of deliberate policy to reduce gender disparities in educational access. Girls' education, measured by gross primary school enrolment ratios, has improved substantially in the Middle East and North Africa region, for example. Nevertheless, in 1990, the region still had 44 million illiterate mothers, a large and increasing backlog leftover from times of lower enrolment levels. Differences in primary school enrolment levels for boys and girls and competition between them are still very significant in a number of countries. In countries where overall enrolment is much lower than desired, girls are particularly disadvantaged.	n

In this context, it is essential to better understand the dynamics of employment in formal enterprises, and the constraints to the creation of formal jobs.	Given the higher-quality of jobs in the modern formal sector, expanding the size of the formal sector is key to more and better jobs. As indicated in the analysis in Chapter1, Coted'Ivoire's main employment challenge stems from the concentration of employment in informal and low-productivity occupations. An analysis of the employment profile illustrates a very low share of wage employment among the employed population. In particular, less than 4 percent of the employed population holds formal private wage jobs. In this context, it is essential to better understand the dynamics of employment in formal enterprises, and the constraints to the creation of formal jobs. This is also particularly relevant as the formal sector constitutes a large share of aggregate value added in the economy.	n

The report shows that manycountries respect key aspects of Convention No.183 even when they have not formally ratified it.	Maternity protection is a fundamental labour right enshrined in key universal human rights instruments. Maternity protection and work-family measures are essential to promoting the health and well-being of mothers and their children, achieving gender equality at work and advancing decent work for both women and men. The provision of child welfare and maternity protection has been a concern for the ILO from its very beginning. Today, 28 ILO member States have ratified Convention No.183, while 66 are party to at least one of the three Maternity Protection Conventions. Virtually allcountries have adopted important legislative provisions concerning maternity protection at work, while laws and measures to support workers with family responsibilities, including fathers, are increasingly emerging across the world. The report shows that manycountries respect key aspects of Convention No.183 even when they have not formally ratified it. For example, 98countries (53per cent) currently provide a statutory minimum of 14 weeks of maternity leave, and 42 of thosecountries meet or exceed the 18 weeks of leave proposed in Recommendation No.191. A total of 58per cent (107countries) provide for cash benefits during maternity leave through national social security schemes. Over 80per cent ofcountries set out explicit prohibitions against discrimination during pregnancy, leave, and/or an additional prescribed period. More than two-thirds of countries have statutory measures on dangerous or unhealthy work which affects pregnant or nursing women, the majority providing protective measures, such as alternatives to hazardous work.	n

"The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence."	"The issue of violence is a recurring theme in the latest dossiers. The importance of this issue reflects the tragic consequences of migration policies in particular contexts or crises, and the emergence of work around migrants' journeys. The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europe"" (33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cecile Canut and Anaik Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language approach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. This perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting sociospatial inequalities in the era of globalization."	n

Nurse Types and Titles Common nurse types across all Central Asian and Indian jurisdictions include general nurses or RNs, midwives, health visitors, nursemidwives, auxiliary nurses/nursing assistants, and bachelor's/basic nurses (Tables C18 through C22). Notably, Bangladesh has six types of RNs. Pakistan, India, Kyrgyzstan, and Bhutan designate additional nurse types in the area of specialty nurse. For instance, the Bhutan Medical and Health Council designates a master's nurse, while the Pakistan Nursing Council designates LPNs, community midwives, family welfare workers, and lady health visitors. Kyrgyzstan's Ministry of Health designates seven specialty nurses including obstetric nurse, nurse anesthetist, nursing nurse, pediatric nurse, physiotherapy nurse, and infectious disease nurse. Afghanistan recognizes an assistant midwife (who must pass the Afghan National Testing and Certification Midwifery Examination), an auxiliary nurse midwife (requiring 6 months of training), and a community midwife (requiring 2 years of training). While India follows both national and state nursing laws, each state is distinct as to which specialty nurse types are designated. Uttarakhand designates only a few, such as a master's nurse, health worker, and a post-basic nurse. Maharashtra designates additional specialty nurses and post-basic nurses, including PhD nurses, master of science in nursing nurses, masters of philosophy in nursing nurses, psychiatric nurses, pediatric nurses, oncological nurses, and critical care nurses.	n

This very diverse set of economies includes Source: Doing Business database. Note: Economies are selected on the basis of the number of reforms and ranked on how much their ease of doing business score improved. First, Doing Business selects the economies that implemented reforms making it easier to do business in three or more of the 10 areas included in this year's aggregate ease of doing business score. Regulatory changes making it more difficult to do business are subtracted from the number of those making it easier. Second, Doing Business ranks these economies on the increase in their ease of doing business score from the previous year. The improvement in their score is calculated not by using the data published in 2017 but by using comparable data that capture data revisions. The choice of the most improved economies is determined by the largest improvements in the ease of doing business score among those with at least three reforms.	n

The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world.	Millions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year. Disruptions such as cyclones, floods and wildfires destroy homes and assets, and contribute to the displacement of people. Slow-onset processes - such as sea-level rise changes in rainfall patterns and droughts - contribute to pressures on livelihoods, and access to food and water, that can contribute to decisions to move away in search of more tenable living conditions. Advances in meteorological and other sciences which inform about the dynamics and pace of climate change indicate that disruptions ranging from extreme weather events to large scale changes in ecosystems are occurring at a pace and intensity unlike any other known period of time on Earth.2 Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increasingly affect migration and other forms of people moving to manage these changing risks.3 This chapter provides an up-to-date overview of environmental change and the spectrum of human mobility. It first explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration, ranging from the view that human mobility including migration is a security issue, that it is an issue of protection, and that it is a matter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change. The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world. It then summarizes recent developments in the international policy sphere on the topic. The conclusion draws out the implications for research, policy and practice.	n
CHAPTER 7 Different countries face different jobs challenges, but their jobs agendas are interconnected by two forces--the migration of people and the migration of jobs.	CHAPTER 7 Different countries face different jobs challenges, but their jobs agendas are interconnected by two forces--the migration of people and the migration of jobs. These two flows have consequences for living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in sending and receiving countries. The arrival of migrants or the outsourcing of jobs abroad affects the living standards of both migrants and locals. The availability of foreign workers, the development of migrant networks channeling savings and ideas, and the arrival of multinational firms bringing more advanced techniques are all bound to increase productivity. But family structures as well as community life are affected by the movement of people and jobs. The potential gains are considerable, but there are also tradeoffs.	n
In October 2016, the South African Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) published a National Integrated Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) policy white paper FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 447 that recommended a number of policies that could have led to a fundamental restructuring of the telecommunications market.	Telkom, a partly state-owned communications company, dominates fixed-line telecommunications services in South Africa. Telkom effectively operates as a monopoly in the fixed-line broadband market, despite the introduction of a second national operator in 2006. The South African government remains the largest shareholder in Telkom with a 39.3 percent direct stake and an additional 12 percent share through the stateowned Public Investment Corporation. In October 2016, the South African Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) published a National Integrated Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) policy white paper FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 447 that recommended a number of policies that could have led to a fundamental restructuring of the telecommunications market. The white paper proposed opening access to both telecommunications infrastructure and high-demand spectrum, as well as the creation of a single national wireless open access network for high-demand spectrum run by a public-private partnership. However, the legislation to implement these policies is stalled in Parliament as the main opposition party contends key provisions are unconstitutional.	n
Current information on schools mainly covers developed countries and future efforts should focus on gathering crowdsourced information in developing countries and to update these applications to capture information on accessibility for any type of disability.	9) Explore crowdsourcing applications to obtain bottom-up information on the accessibility of schools for persons with disabilities to inform accessibility policies. Assessing the accessibility of schools is expensive and complex. Several online and smartphone applications already allow users to publicly review accessibility for wheelchair users of any facility in the world, including schools. Current information on schools mainly covers developed countries and future efforts should focus on gathering crowdsourced information in developing countries and to update these applications to capture information on accessibility for any type of disability. Crowdsourced information reflects the direct experience of the users and can be helpful to inform national accessibility policies for education. 96 .	n
Skills, especially cognitive abilities, are strongly related to productivity growth, more so than school attendance rates.71 They also are closely associated with structural transformation, especially for low-and lower-middle-income countries where they create opportunities for people outside of agriculture.72 Across 1,500 subnational regions in 110 countries, education emerges as the critical determinant of knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurship.73 And skills can shape how jobs link people to neighbors, communities, and societies.

Skills mismatches are arguably growing rather than shrinking. Albeit not easy to pinpoint, up to one-third of the employed in countries as diverse as Brazil, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania are either under-or over-qualified for the work they do.75 Managers of registered, formal firms around the world judge workforce skills as an obstacle of above-average importance in the production process.76 In countries at all development levels, skills obstacles are also judged to be more acute now than in the first half of the 2000s (figure 5.13).	n

The health component of HDI is measured by life expectancy at birth.	Factors that contribute to differences in cancer incidence and mortality across countries include variations in age structure; prevalence of risk factors; and availability and use of preventive services, early detection tests (e.g., mammography), and high-quality treatment (mortality). Many of these factors are strongly influenced by level of development. For example, cancers associated with infection are more common in lower-HDI countries because of a higher prevalence of cancer-causing infections, such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). While approximately 15% of all incident cancers worldwide are attributed to infections, the percentage is about three times higher in low-(25%) and medium-(23%) HDI countries than in very Human Development Index The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of development that considers not only standard of living, but also health and education. The health component of HDI is measured by life expectancy at birth. Education includes average years of schooling for adults 25 years of age and older and expected years of schooling for children. Standard of living is measured by gross national income per capita. These scores are used to create a composite measure that can be grouped into levels: low, medium, high, and very high HDI.	n

The IUCN guidelines note that category II should 'provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities'.	The park's multiple international designations--World Heritage, Biosphere Reserve, Ramsar--together with the fact that it includes Korea's highest mountain make the park a major tourist destination. Hallasan is also being considered for Geopark status. This international recognition reinforces the biodiversity and geodiversity values of the park. Management is clearly strongly oriented toward the protection of these values. As the objectives are primarily aimed at conservation and recreation, use of category II seems to be justified. IUCN WCPA Best Practice Guidance on Recognising Protected Areas and Assigning Management Categories and Governance Types Recommendations Although the physical characteristics of the park coupled with the overall management objectives of Hallasan conform to category II assignment, it was considered that there were opportunities to further adapt management to strengthen the objectives of category II assignment. The IUCN guidelines note that category II should 'provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities'. The development of the visitor centre, ecoguides and trail management are important steps towards this goal; however, the decline in visitor satisfaction following the closing of several major trails (due to track deterioration) and lack of visitor interpretation about the ecosystem functions of the park should be addressed. The strong regulatory regime for visitors is commendable in terms of protection, however, risks losing public support. Opportunities could be explored to provide limited and guided tours to more sensitive areas and to enjoy the park at different times of the day--for example, sunset walks or evening walks may be feasible without damaging sensitive environments.	n

In the context of health systems, a MHiAP response - modelled on the WHO Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach38 and drawing on the MIPEX Health Strand39 - aims to engage all the crucial governance actors and sectors involved in the field of migration and health. An example of this in action is the development of the National Migration Health Policy and action framework in Sri Lanka (see text box below). 35 Bhopal, 1997. 36 Hiam, Steele and McKee, 2018. 37 IOM, 2017a. 38 Juarez ET Al., 2019; WHO, 2014. 39 IOM, 2017a. 222 Migration and health: Current issues, governance and knowledge gaps Lessons from advancing a National Migration Health Policy and action framework in Sri Lanka Migration continues to be a catalyst to Sri Lanka's development within the South Asian region. Sri Lanka is both a labour-sending country (with over 2 million of its citizens working abroad), and a labour-receiving one - with a growing number of migrant workers from countries such as India and China arriving to work on large-scale infrastructure projects, such as new highways, seaports and airports. Such development is projected to further increase population mobility into and within the island. The end of a protracted civil war led to a return of Sri Lankan refugees from India and other countries, with many more internally displaced persons returning to their places of origin.	n

The primary objective was to provide training for both Thai national and Southeast Asian scientists on post harvest handling, technologies for professing and utilization, technologies for post-harvest storage and technologies and conditions affecting shelf life of peanut products. A significant feature of the training is that it was to occur at the village levels and at Kasetsart University. 1.2 Annual Budget: In 2003-2004, the budget for this project was US$20,000, of which US$10,000 (50%) was transferred to the Thai collaborating institution (KU) to support training courses. There was significant leveraging of funds from the Thai government that provided cash outlay of Bhat700,000 (US$17,500 equivalent) in 2003, and Bhat400,000 (US$10,000 equivalent) as counterpart fund. The Thai Project Investigators indicated that as long as they receive Peanut CRSP funding, they could justify and receive government funds. Other donors, like USAID and FAO, have also funded some training, including gender training. The Thai Princess's Royal Project procured equipment for small-scale peanut processors, who are usually women, located in very poor communities.	n
The Ecological Footprint is increasingly gaining entrance into German and EU politics and is being employed in many places on a regional level, for example in Agenda 21 processes.	Germany's development of environmentally friendly production processes, services and procedures makes the country one of the environmental trailblazers in the industrialized world. The Ecological Footprint is increasingly gaining entrance into German and EU politics and is being employed in many places on a regional level, for example in Agenda 21 processes. Footprint studies have already been completed for cities such as Berlin and Munich since 2000 (see the case study on Berlin on pg. 42). In 2007, the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt) sponsored a comprehensive analysis and evaluation regarding the possible use of the Ecological Footprint as an environmental indicator for Germany.	n

Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school.	Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school. The project program implies long-term comprehensive training, which is designed for a period of up to 9 years and can take place in parallel with the basic educa1on and in addi1on to it; 4. Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project. The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy. The total number of employees and developers is about 100 people; 5. Constant adjustment and upda1ng of the training program through the introduc1on of modern educa1onal modules, relevant training plaKorms, as well as interes1ng and non-standard tasks and projects for selfimplementa1on;6. Sources of stable financial flows: The volume of financial revenues of the company is formed through three permanent channels: training in its own divisions, the implementa1on of franchises (lump-sum contribu1ons), and regular payments by exis1ng franchisees (royal1es); 7. The possibility of replica1on of the project in any locality (popula1on size does not maher);8. The project's target audience is children and adolescents aged 6-14 (children at this age are especially suscep1ble to new knowledge, are interested in modern technologies, and ac1vely use gadgets, but use them mainly for entertainment) and their parents (they care about quality educa1on of their children, and precisely at the age of 6-14 invest the core capital in their development).	n

PILLAR 8: PRICE COMPETITIVENESS 8.01 Ticket taxes and airport charges Index of relative cost of access (ticket taxes and airport charges) to international air transport services (0 = highest cost, 100 = lowest cost) | 2018 or most recent This index measures the relative cost of access to international air transport services based on the level of airport charges, passenger ticket taxes and value-added taxation. It reflects the costs associated with narrow-body and wide-body passenger plane arrival and departure at the major international airports in each country. Charges include landing, terminal navigation and passenger and security charges as listed in the IATA Airport and Air Navigation Charges manual. Ticket taxes applicable to international travel were applied as described in the IATA List of Ticket and Airport Taxes and Fees manual. Per-passenger charges were calculated by applying a 75% load factor to a typical seating configuration of each type of aircraft. Value-added taxes (VATs) were calculated based on an average ticket price for each country, applied to half of the departing passengers, because the VAT is normally charged only on itineraries originating in the country concerned. A higher score indicates a lower level of charges and taxes.	n
"An increase in peanut export, because of aflatoxin-free peanut-based products (i.e., Mama Sita,s ""Kare-kare"" Mix), also contributed to this achievement."	"Philippines: One of the most significant achievements of this project has been the establishment of strong linkages with the private food industry in the Philippines, which made it possible for the development of an Industry Incubator Model to transfer PCRSP technologies. Even in Phase 1 of the project, PCRSP had already linked with the food industry to test and later commercialize peanut-based products developed in the Philippines and the U.S., through UGA. This initial linkage is with mediumsized companies (Newborn Foods, Inc. and Marigold Commodities Inc.). The availability of improved and safe peanut products in stores and supermarkets in Metro Manila, generated by the Vitamin A-fortified peanut butter, increased local consumption.

Strengthening linkages to extension, farmers, and entrepreneurs.	Aflatoxin has been shown to suppress immunity in people and cause underweight in children.. A study is planned in Ghana to use Novosil clay in human diet in capsule form (TAM50); there was no adverse effect of Novosil clay in rats. Also in Ghana (OKS55), traditional peanut products were reformulated to incorporate Novosil clay (at 0.5-1.0%) without adverse effect on consumer acceptance. 6. Strengthening linkages to extension, farmers, and entrepreneurs. To facilitate the adoption of Peanut CRSP developed technologies, many projects have linked with extension institutions and producers/farmers' associations, mainly through host country initiatives. Examples are: (1) the Princess Sirinthorn' development project in poor villages in Thailand with Kasetsart University and extension service providing training and guidance to villagers (mostly women) on using Peanut CRSP technologies (UGA37); and (2) ANAPO, a progressive farmers' association, has developed a Peanut Seed Program in Bolivia, and linked with farmers' associations (UFL16).	n
These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery), storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities.	Nearby access to off-farm self-and wage employment in the rural economy and secondary towns is especially important for better and inclusive employment. Cross-country evidence from across the world shows convincingly that movements out of agriculture to the rural economy, secondary towns, and secondary cities (defined as less than 1 million inhabitants) are more poverty reducing than exits out of agriculture into the metropoles.48 While those who make it to the city, tend to gain much more on average than those who move nearby, only few of the poor manage to do so, and many more find their way into off-farm activities when they are nearby. The end outcome is one of an accelerated poverty reduction when people can find off-farm employment opportunities nearby. Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas. These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery), storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities. Even before accounting for related services agribusiness activities, including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing (ISIC 15) alone accounted for more than 30 percent of total formal employment and more than 20 percent of value added in formal firms (Figure5.5). Agribusiness also forms the only source of formal manufacturing jobs outside Abidjan. The past couple of years have witnessed a small increase in formal enterprise establishments outside Abidjan (Chapter5), though much room for expansion remains.	n

TA B L E 6 .1 Projects in extractive industries are capital intensive and create few jobs Diverse jobs agendas 201 for some: each hard rock miner could earn the equivalent of US$50,000-$75,000 a year, and each alluvial miner could make around US$10,000 a year. This income became the main contribution to the local economy, together with remittances sent by those ex-Misima Mines Limited employees who found work in large mines elsewhere.44 And even in mining areas, social impacts are more mixed than the positive effect on living standards suggests. The influx of money from mining enclaves has enabled men to pay high prices for brides and marry multiple wives on an unprecedented scale, which might have contributed to a decline in women's status. Around Porgera Mine, the abandonment of older wives and the increasing number of women taken from other tribal groups are considered factors in the increased incidence of domestic violence and tension with neighboring groups. In Lihir, when groups of landowners received compensation and royalty payments, no women were given authority to control the accounts.45 In addition, children normally help out in artisanal and small-scale mines. In Misima, because of clear restrictions and training by the Wau Small-Scale Mining Center, children are less involved in mining than before, but child labor remains a con- Artisanal mining can flourish in parallel with major investments and raise the living standards of local communities. In Papua New Guinea, the number of grassroots alluvial miners is two to three times greater than the number of people working in the formal extractive industries sector, even if contractors and temporary workers are counted among the latter.

The investment climate matters for business performance as well.	While this calculation is hypothetical, several studies report that observable characteristics of micro-and small informal enterprise owners, such as education and gender, are important determinants of innovation and employment growth.65 In Mexico, after a business registration reform, informal enterprise owners with observable traits similar to those found among formal enterprise owners were more likely to register their business than those similar to wage workers.66 What constrains entrepreneurship? Even potentially skilled entrepreneurs would have difficulty succeeding without access to basic infrastructure and financial resources. In their absence, managerial capacity alone may not be enough to realize productivity gains and employment expansion. The investment climate matters for business performance as well.	n

Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development.	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).	n

Thus the project can move on to the next phase which is to gain further data on human safety, and to test efficacy of NS clay in naturally exposed people in Ghana.	The second study was undertaken to test humans for responses to exposure to NS clay without the exposure to aflatoxin. The information gained from this study, coupled with the chronic and sub-chronic toxicity studies in rats will serve as the basis for use of NS clay in long-term human intervention trials in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis in Ghana. A randomized and double-blinded phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine the safety and tolerance of NS clay in humans and establish dosimetry protocols for long-term efficacy studies. Volunteers (20 - 45 yr in age), were clinically screened for confirmation of their health status. Fifty subjects (23 males and 27 females) were randomly divided into two groups: the low-dose group received six capsules containing 1.5 g/day, and the high-dose group Project TAM50 - 145 - received 6 capsules containing 3.0 g/day for a period of two weeks. NS clay capsules were distributed to each participant three times a day at designated sites. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after the study for laboratory analysis. Each participant completed the trial and compliance was 99.1%. All laboratory analyses, including hematology, minerals, vitamins A and E, and concentrations of selected electrolytes have been completed. Clinical and sub-clinical analyses, before and after NS clay exposure, have also been evaluated. The study examined in great detail the consequences of exposure to NS clay and found no evidence of increased risk. Thus the project can move on to the next phase which is to gain further data on human safety, and to test efficacy of NS clay in naturally exposed people in Ghana.	n

A complete curriculum has been developed, containing a facilitators' manual and a technical manual dealing with all management interventions from land preparation to harvest and postharvest issues.	Inland valleys have very complex, dynamic, and diverse human, social, natural, and physical dimensions and interconnections. This complexity needs to be understood to determine options for improved and integrated natural resource management. Given the diversity of inland-valley ecosystems, a bottom-up social learning process will be critical. Only then can sustainable and lasting impact on food security in the region be achieved. A participatory learning and action research approach among inlandvalley development stakeholders (farmers, change agents, extension, research) at the grassroots level is required. This will help build bridges between indigenous knowledge and scientific expertise, and stimulate the formation of networks between farmers and other inlandvalley development stakeholders. It will also be instrumental to the development of an INRM framework and curriculum for farmer learning for inland valleys in West Africa. WARDA is using integrated rice management as an entry point to INRM for inland valleys. A complete curriculum has been developed, containing a facilitators' manual and a technical manual dealing with all management interventions from land preparation to harvest and postharvest issues.

The development of profitable lowland rice technologies is therefore a central element in strategies to induce farmers to reduce pressure on rapidly degraded uplands by shifting cultivation to lowland ecosystems.	Rice, environmental degradation, and sustainable intensification In highly populated areas of West Africa, rising cropping intensity in fragile upland ecosystems has already begun to degrade the resource base, with environmental damage and loss in production potential. Rice has a key role to play in providing options for sustainable intensification. Rice is uniquely well adapted to flooded lowland ecosystems where the soils are least fragile and best able to support continuous cultivation. The development of profitable lowland rice technologies is therefore a central element in strategies to induce farmers to reduce pressure on rapidly degraded uplands by shifting cultivation to lowland ecosystems. Relative to other cereals, rice also responds more to improved management and to higher inputs of nutrients, water control, and labor, and is thus favored as production systems intensify.	n

Feed the soil and let the soil feed the plants.	Q What was the most important lesson you've learnt since starting your work in organic cotton? Feed the soil and let the soil feed the plants. Organic certification serves a certain function but is not a true proxy for environmental outcomes. We need to align intention and incentives to actively support farmers adopt practices that will restore soil health and there needs to be a financial mechanism that meets this need. Organic premium again is based on production. Models like carbon insetting helps companies to invest in practices that reduce carbon emissions within their supply chain while supporting farmers to adopt carbon farming practices. This helps companies to meet both sustainable sourcing and climate goals.	n

Both in China and in Germany, a considerable reduction of carbon emissions could significantly reduce the ecological deficit. Due to the high degree of urbanization in both countries, infrastructure investments that lead to a reduction in resource consumption will be important. trade and the ecological Footprint Both China and Germany are reliant on net imports from other countries to balance their ecological deficits. China has developed into a global hub for product manufacturing. Its trade relations are characterized by raw material imports (e.g., metals and wood from Latin America, oil and cotton from Africa, or wool from Australia), of which only a quarter remain in the country. Changing Chinese consumption habits that have accompanied an improved standard of living (such as increasing meat and milk consumption) are demanding a growing number of imports, namely, agricultural and grazing land products. Although a major portion of resources leave China again in the form of finished products (e.g., paper, furniture or textiles) for the USA, Japan, Australia, South Korea and the EU, overall imports exceeded exports in 2005; the trade balance in this year was negative. Germany, on the other hand, had a positive trade balance and exported more than was imported in 2005; the German Footprint of consumption was 0.4 gha per capita smaller than the production Footprint. This may be caused in part by use of resources for the export of manufactured goods e.g., automobiles). Part 6 National Footprints: living on large feet and on small .	n

In economies where the electrician profession is well regulated, norms are respected and the informal sector is small, liability regimes may be sufficient to ensure public safety, provided there is an efficient court system to foster accountability.	The choice of whether to employ internal wiring inspections or liability regimes (or both) varies from economy to economy as it depends on myriad factors (such as existing regulation, the size of the informal sector or history of wiring incidents). In economies where the electrician profession is well regulated, norms are respected and the informal sector is small, liability regimes may be sufficient to ensure public safety, provided there is an efficient court system to foster accountability. Internal wiring inspections for lower risk constructions may not be necessary, as is current practice in OECD high-income economies such as Germany and Sweden. These economies do not require internal wiring checks as all electricians (i) must undergo a rigorous professional certification process and (ii) are held legally responsible that the installations they carry out are up to code.	n

Particularly vulnerable people include those living in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, where there is already difficulty accessing markets and services without morbidity and social distancing, and those affected by natural hazards or other crises - for example, due to droughts, the coming monsoon and hurricane seasons, and the current locust plague, the worst in decades, which is severely impacting food security in East Africa and beyond. In such situations, the disruption in supply chains and movement restrictions will affect humanitarian programmes and impact the delivery of humanitarian operations, including the distribution of micronutrients to children and pregnant and lactating women, treatment of acutely malnourished children, and distribution of fortified foods.	n

Climate-smart technologies and practices are emerging, including methods to expand biomass energy production from crop and food wastes, manure management, renewable energy-based farming systems, solar-or wind-powered water pumping, drip irrigation, innovative greenhouse technologies, and efficient field machinery.	Climate-smart technologies and practices are emerging, including methods to expand biomass energy production from crop and food wastes, manure management, renewable energy-based farming systems, solar-or wind-powered water pumping, drip irrigation, innovative greenhouse technologies, and efficient field machinery. Still critically needed are additional public-private early warning systems for weather, crop yields, and seasonal climate events and public support for innovation in sustainability-enhancing agricultural technology.	n
See Appendix I for information on regional categories and methodological notes.	Notes 1. Information on the normal duration of maternity leave, cash benefits and the source of payments is available for 185 countries and territories. For the rest of the issues in this section (i.e., when maternity leave can be taken and rules about the extension or reduction of the leave period) the set of countries with available information varies and will be stated where percentages are presented. See Appendix I for information on regional categories and methodological notes. 2. As of January 2014. See Normlex, information system on international labour standards, available at: Http://www.ilo. Org/Normlex [25 Mar. 2014]. 3. Members of the European Union are subject to Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding [EU Pregnant Workers Directive]. The minimum length of maternity leave required by the Directive is the same as in Convention No. 183: 14 weeks (European Economic Community, 1992, Article 8(1). All EU Member States meet the 14-week minimum. In 2013, Iceland, which provides three months of maternity leave, introduced a new Bill including a plan to expand the share of non-transferable parental leave period from three to five months for each parent with a reduction in the shared period of leave from three to two months, according to a 5+5+2 model, instead of the current 3+3+3 one (O'Brien, 2013). 4. In 1994, the ILO had data on maternity leave duration and cash benefits for 139 countries, as reported in the Conditions of work digest: Maternity and work, Vol. 13 (Geneva, ILO, 1994).	n
Other members of the sector benefitted from the shift to digital because they could access more digital offers and services - webinars, tools, knowledge databases, etc. Naturally, many of these professional communications and initiatives have a strong focus on adapting, maintaining or improving library services and offers to their patrons and communities.	The primary beneficiaries of these activities are members of the global library sector. For some, the digital transformation opened more channels and opportunities to participate in dialogues, exchanges of experience and collaborations. The sector itself of course stands to benefit from this wider pool of engaged participants, from their experiences and insights.

Some migration journeys are highly gendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity.	Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration. Some migration journeys are highly gendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity. Many other migrations, the majority, include both boys and girls, though sometimes in different ratios, depending on country of origin. Much child migration, particularly outside the context of conflict or disaster, is safe and undertaken as part of a family unit. However, there is an increasing tendency for children to be involved in migration that jeopardizes their safety and violates their rights. Examples of this type of migration include not only the obviously life-threatening forced migrations across treacherous routes - such as the Eastern and Central Mediterranean, where drownings are frequent - but also migrations where children are routinely exposed to physical and/or sexual violence. Unsafe migration also includes situations where children rely on exploitative intermediaries who take advantage of the need for migration assistance to extract labour or other types of services from children in their custody. The discussion focuses on these aspects of child migration.	n
And that nature provides us with certain services such as clean water, intact forests, and a basic food supply.	You grappled with the Footprint creatively and communicatively. There it had less to do with scientific aspects than with the big questions: How do we implement things and get conversations going? Does the Footprint work in this respect? tatjana: Our dance theater was a very metaphorical representation of environmental destruction and excessive resource consumption. I had the feeling that a great deal was communicated to the audience. People understood that we are destroying our basis for life if we continue with business as usual. And that nature provides us with certain services such as clean water, intact forests, and a basic food supply. By the Footprint, this was portrayed in a very nice way.	n

The Thai training project has developed a cadre of peanut food technology scientists who continue to network to share information about peanut research and product development.	Main beneficiaries of this training project are Thai villagers, both consumers and micro-processors, at the community level. They are mainly women involved in producing traditional peanut products and have learned new/improved, optimized and standardized peanut products from the training. They have benefited from the training on manual sorting technology to produce aflatoxin-free peanut products, and improved packaging. Their new enterprise has become a main source of cash income for the family. Thai scientists, researchers, extension workers, and the private food industry representatives have benefited from the sustained training efforts since Phase 1 of the project. Many have become excellent trainers for the continuing international, national, and village-level training in Thailand. Another group of beneficiaries are Southeast Asian scientists/researchers who have participated in the international courses funded partly by Peanut CRSP on Peanut Processing, Packaging, and Utilization Technologies held at Kasetsart University in Bangkok. Participants have ongoing projects or were expected to initiate food technology-related activities in their own countries after their training. The Thai training project has developed a cadre of peanut food technology scientists who continue to network to share information about peanut research and product development.	n

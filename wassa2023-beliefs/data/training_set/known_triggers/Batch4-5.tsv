The full report on the Senegal survey related to aflatoxin and the health of peanut farmers in the Peanut Basin conducted by ENEA is available on the Peanut CRSP website. Uganda: Farm level and market surveys in Uganda showed low levels of aflatoxin contamination immediately after harvest and drying. However, processed nuts on sale in urban market centers contain aflatoxin levels of 2-3 times higher than the WHO allowable limits and 10 times higher than EU standards, an indication that aflatoxin contamination occurs during post-harvest handling and processing stages.

Across countries, the presence of institutions that protect property rights, uphold the rule of law, and rein in corruption is associated with higher levels of development.90 Property rights foster private sector growth by allowing firms to invest without the fear that their assets will be stolen or confiscated.91 The ability to enforce contracts widens the circle of potential suppliers and customers, as personal connections become less important in establishing trust.92 The rule of law has direct implications for the growth of firms and jobs. Entrepreneurs who believe their property rights are secure reinvest more of their profits than those who do not.93 Conversely, rampant crime and violence are likely to drive firms away and discourage domestic and foreign investment.94 Across countries, investment climate surveys 26 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 youth, women, and the less skilled. In Colombia and Indonesia, minimum wage increases had only a modest overall effect but the employment impact was stronger for young workers.101 Regulations more clearly affect job flows, creating ""stickiness"" in the labor market and slowing the pace of labor reallocation. 102 While this hinders economic efficiency, the evidence on productivity is fairly inconclusive, though admittedly scarce.103 In developing countries, collective bargaining does not have a major impact outside the public sector and activities characterized by limited competition, where there are rents to share.104 Unions consistently raise wages for workers. Studies place this premium in the 5 to 15 percent range in Mexico; around 5 percent in Korea; and at 10 to 20 percent in South Africa.105 The costs in terms of reduced jobs are not so clear, however. In some countries, though not all, the tradeoff seems to be lower employment, but even then the magnitudes are relatively small. The limited evidence on union effects on productivity is also mixed.106 The main challenges are extending voice to those who are not wage earners, so that the constraints facing their farms and microenterprises can be addressed, and organizing collective bargaining in a way that enhances productivity."

The number of workers deployed was hard to estimate and believed to be in decline, as some countries, such as China, Kuwait, Poland, Qatar and Sri Lanka, stopped renewing or issuing additional work visas to North Koreans in order to comply with the new UN sanctions on North Korea's economic activities abroad. North Korea derived part of its state revenue from these workers, who did not receive their wages directly from their employers, but from their government after significant deductions. The North Korean authorities maintained tight control on the workers' communications and movement, and deprived them of information about workers' rights in the host countries. Workers remaining in their host countries continued to be subjected to excessive working hours and were vulnerable in terms of occupational health and safety. The media reported cases of North Koreans dying while working in Russia, which hosted at least 20,000 North Koreans. In May, two construction workers died in the Russian capital Moscow after complaining of breathing problems; they were believed to have suffered acute heart failure. A subcontractor of a World Cup stadium project in St Petersburg, where a worker died from heart failure in November 2016, said in a media interview that many workers suffered from severe fatigue due to working long hours continuously for months without rest days.

""The Chinese don't have the imagination piece. This may be a cultural thing that's very hard to change. We have that in this country. Some countries are good at copying things. They are content takers, not makers. As a result, the takers are hiring Americans to do the imagination part because we are content makers. Just look at Apple. No surprise that most Asian car manufacturers design the cars here. Freedom is an integral part of this, and the Chinese don't have it and probably won't for the foreseeable future."" Hard to say how long the foreseeable is, but Wu plans to keep innovating and not wait to find out. He believes that part of imagination is sustainability and that it should be considered in everything the company does. He says sustainability generates imagination when you are forced to look at the whole process, the whole life cycle, as Infinity does with everything it repairs and sells. ""It's not easy and takes time. We start by telling people that they are unconscious and unskilled, and that at the end of the process they will be conscious and skilled. And finally they will be unconscious and skilled. In other words, looking at things in new ways will become second nature; they won't have to think about doing that."" It may sound ""very southern California,"" but Wu insists it works. ""We're all doing it, including me. We think it works. When we say you are unconscious and unskilled, don't take it personally; it's not a criticism. The goal is unconscious and skilled. The goal is for insights to become second nature. It's a long process."" Lastly, Wu has learned to be optimistic about the future of manufacturing in the United States. ""It has been more than 30 years since my parents overcame hardships in China to bring our family to the United States.

COMEX Resolution 116 requires all agricultural imports to be accompanied by an import permit issued by AGROCALIDAD. For over 50 food and agricultural products, Ecuador also requires prior import authorization from MAG or the MSP, or both, depending on the particular product.

Given the difficulty many jurisdictions face in quantifying the social and economic impacts of FLR activities, and the lack of easily accessible guidance and tools to do so, the number of jobs created was selected as this indicator. Recognising FLR activities can produce short-term/seasonal employment as well as long-term jobs (generally considered more valuable to the economy), and that these data are already collected by some jurisdictions, the option to report jobs created in these two separate categories was provided in the protocol. However, this distinction does not match all of the existing models and methods for quantifying this FLR impact. For example, the model applied by Mexico and El Salvador to determine employment from FLR activities distinguished between direct and indirect employment rather than the length of employment. Responses were provided accordingly. Nevertheless, it was determined that where countries could distinguish between short-and long-term employment impacts, this should be represented in the Barometer. Any other distinctions made in reporting as a result of the quantification/data collection approach are treated as a single value of total jobs created. 8 .

Under Australia's requirements, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) conducts an individual country risk analysis. In 2017, FSANZ issued its final report for the United States, which determined that U.S. beef imports are safe for human consumption, and recommended Category 1 status be afforded to U.S. beef under Australia's import requirements. The findings also confirmed that U.S. beef meets the negligible BSE risk requirements of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Following Australia's report, U.S. and Australian officials completed negotiation of the final requirements for heattreated, shelf-stable U.S. beef products and opened Australia's market to these products in May 2018, after a 14-year ban. For fresh (chilled or frozen) beef and beef products, the Australian government, in December 2015, began the review of its import requirements for three countries that applied for export to Australia: the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. This review, which concluded in August 2017, considered fresh (chilled or frozen) beef and beef products such as: meat, bone, and offal of cattle; buffalo; and bison.

Safety nets programs typically target the poorest populations, including those engaged in low-productivity self-employment. The set-up of safety nets can facilitate savings, encourage risk taking and more broadly stimulate demand. Care should be taken in not excluding individuals from productive interventions on the basis of ad hoc criteria. Indeed, studies have shown that the most constrained individuals can stand to gain a lot from productive interventions addressing capital or skill constraints. This is particularly the case for multi-faceted graduation programs that target the poor and provide a mix of cash transfers, productive asset transfer (typically cash or livestock) and training, along with regular coaching visits and access to savings. An evaluation of the graduation approach in six countries around the world showed large impacts on earnings, consumption, food security and assets (Banerjee et al., 2015).

Public sector entities are also obliged to undertake accessibility audits, and develop and implement plans to realize the right to accessibility, which is called for by the CRPD ""to ensure that private entities that offer facilities and services which are open or provided to the public take into account all aspects of accessibility for persons with disabilities"" (article 9, paragraph 2(b)). States Parties must take all appropriate measures to urge private entities to make information and services available in accessible formats for persons with disabilities (article 21, paragraph (c)). The CRPD also includes a provision for access to a range of in-home, residential and in community support services (article 19, paragraph (b)), and the equal availability of services and facilities for general populations on an equal basis to persons with disabilities (article 19, paragraph (c)).

Asia Initiatives is addressing this challenge by raising funds to provide devices and data cards for Internet connectivity. Additionally, to leverage a pool of skilled volunteers and mentors to be trained at short notice. The challenge is further compounded by the linguistic and cultural diversity of different regions of India where these schools are located. They are exploring local and multi-sector partnerships to support the existing project and help expand their reach - both long and short term. Short-term needs include: volunteers to impart training skills to the teachers and field staff, leveraging support of the parents through raising awareness and encouraging parental engagement. Long-term: acquiring low-cost digital devices to ensure continuity of learning, reconfiguring lessons to individualized learning and nutritional requirements for the students. The SoCCs Buddies model is based on a low cost approach to imparting education and it's replicability and flexibility ensures that it is sustainable.

Lessons occur oneto-one, in small groups (5-10 students) or in large groups (20 students or more). The venue of the teaching can be tutors place of residence (one-to-one or small groups), the tutee's place of residence (usually one-to-one) or special teaching centres (large groups) known as coaching centres (Hamid; Sussex & Khan, 2009, p. 281). There are many differences found in the ages and qualifications of private tutors. In many settings, secondary school students earn pocket money by tutoring primary school children, and similarly university students tutors secondary students. At other end of the age scale, many tutors are retirees who wish still to contribute to society and earn some extra money. Between these two extremes of age are others who provide tutoring on a full time or part time basis, and who may or may not have formal training.

Fossil fuel companies could find themselves saddled with reserves that are, in the words of Bank of England Governor Mark Carney (2015), ""literally unburnable"" in a world moving toward a low-carbon global economy. These firms could see their earnings decline, businesses disrupted, and funding costs increase because of policy action, technological change, and consumer and investor demands for alignment with policies to tackle climate change.

Many of these factors are strongly influenced by level of development. For example, cancers associated with infection are more common in lower-HDI countries because of a higher prevalence of cancer-causing infections, such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

Raising productivity in agriculture requires developing a rural workforce of better-educated farmers. Better-educated farmers are more likely to adopt modern farm inputs and technologies, make better use of purchased inputs and labor, choose technologies more effectively, and respond rapidly to changes in markets (Schultz 1988; Filmer et al. 2014). Improving the levels of basic educational attainment, through the development of reading, writing, and numeracy skills among the rural workforce, the efficacy of agricultural training can be significantly improved. And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture, the demand for schooling and more technical skills will rise. This will include the ability to use digital technology to access and interpret information as it may be transformative in how farmers learn to interact optimally with markets and receive information, such as weather predictions, that impact their farming decisions (Box 6.1).

Along the chromosomes, about 50,000 genes make up the genome. Scientists have been working for several years on rice gene sequencing: pinpointing each gene and deciphering DNA sequence structure, variation, and function. The study is called genomics. The entire sequence of genes along the rice chromosomes is being elucidated by various groups. Syngenta, a multinational agribusiness corporation, and the Beijing Genomics Institute published their sequencing of the rice genome in April 2002. The International Rice Genome Sequencing Project led by Japan expects to complete its task by the end of 2002.

There has been limited reliance on self-isolation due to the difficulties of implementing this in congested urban settlements where it is unrealistic for a person to be kept separate from others. However, similar issues have arisen as for quarantining international arrivals, with gaps in the quality and capacity of isolation facilities limiting effectiveness.

Thus the migration of skilled workers not only creates a fiscal and distributive concern in the short term, but it also impairs the growth capacities of the country in the long term. In this view, developing countries should create incentives for skilled workers to return to their home country, for example, through financial reforms of secondary and tertiary education.

cffebf40-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor87.txt	After the 2000 floods, 43,400 families were resettled to less flood-prone areas (IFRC 2002). Shelter assistance to those not resettling on approved sites was forbidden (Cosgrave 2001). The temporary accommodation centers were closed down as soon as possible after the disaster, and lack of preparatory work at some resettlement sites caused unnecessary suffering according to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) evaluation. The community survey shows that the resettlement program raised a number of issues: * Many of the resettled populations had to move a considerable distance from their farms. This led to the households taking one of two options - refusing to move and maintaining their homes in the lowlands but not receiving any official support, or living in the resettled areas and building temporary shelter near the farms during peak agricultural work periods. Facilities such as schools and health clinics are being provided in the resettled areas. * Families resettled from the city of Maputo were please to find themselves with more space and privacy than previously experienced in the overcrowded suburbs. This was mentioned as a positive aspect. However, these families were faced with reinventing livelihood strategies - becoming farmers instead of petty traders and social disruption with the male members of the household staying in the city during the week and only returning home at weekends in order to maintain jobs and other income earning opportunities. The majority of households in Marracuene was pleased with the new housing arrangements and felt that the fresh start may help to create a community spirit not apparent in the city, where criminality was one of the major risks to household livelihood security. * In areas such as Chokwe where land was not an issue, resettled families were accepted and absorbed.

cffebf44-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor96.txt	"Local humanitarian action has its own set of gender biases and sexist norms that ignore or devalue women's leadership. For example, women humanitarian leaders in both countries identified care work as a hurdle affecting their ability to participate in humanitarian action, because women leaders find themselves--often unlike their male counterparts--having to juggle both work and family responsibilities. In Bangladesh, a Rohingya woman leader spoke about the challenge of finding time to spend on work and with colleagues owing to the competing demands of the household. In South Sudan, a woman head of a national NGO shared that she gets ""traumatized balancing our job roles and family,"" which can become overwhelming. The dual burden women leaders face needs more consideration and acknowledgment. 7 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan Disconnect from the humanitarian system Women's organizations generally struggle to be integrated into the mainstream humanitarian coordination system, making it a challenge for them to gain national-level recognition as significant humanitarian actors. If women and women's organizations are not considered humanitarian actors, they may be excluded from capacity-building and funding opportunities available as part of LHL programming, let alone from greater leadership roles. Yet this does not mean that women's organizations are not involved in humanitarian action; many provide humanitarian relief as part of their portfolios, and others do so when emergencies strike in their communities. In fact, although they are the exception, several women's organizations identified in the research are members of the United Nations-led cluster system in their respective countries, such as the Agrajattra Organization in Bangladesh, a women-led organization, which is a member of the child protection sub-cluster and the food security and shelter clusters, and the South Sudan Women's Empowerment Network, which is in the gender-based violence and child protection sub-clusters."

While crises affect both nationals and non-nationals, the ability of migrants to cope with their impacts may be reduced, due to conditions of vulnerability associated with migrants' legal, economic and social status, as well as practical challenges, such as linguistic differences, geographic displacement and even cultural context, which can limit access to timely and understandable information, services, resources and safety. While not all migrants are equally affected in times of crisis, they are often among the most vulnerable, at increased risk and in need of specific support.2 Addressing the needs of migrants living in places affected by crisis has become a priority of policy forums at both global and regional levels. Recent initiatives and policy processes include regional dialogues on migration in Africa, the Americas, and Central and South-East Asia; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030; the Paris Agreement; and the World Humanitarian Summit. The Migrants in Countries in Crisis (MICIC) Initiative and the development of the set of Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster3 provide concrete examples of efforts to improve current practice.4 The situation of migrants in crisis contexts is also acknowledged in the 2018 Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, where it is highlighted as an essential element for the achievement of objective 2 on minimizing the drivers of forced migration, and objective 7 on reducing migrants' vulnerability.

There is also a tendency for women leaders to find it more challenging to engage at the national level as opposed to the community level where ""grassroots women's organizations with strong track records in advancing community development find themselves excluded and disconnected from national disaster risk reduction and recovery programs"" (Gupta and Leung 2010, iii).8 Breaking through the barriers between the community, local, national, and global levels remains a difficult venture. 24 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan It is important to recognize that some women's organizations may choose not to be part of the formal global humanitarian coordination system. One scholar working on women's humanitarian leadership in Haiti noted that several strong women's rights organizations opted out of the cluster system during the earthquake response, as they found it patriarchal and harmful to women's interests (Canadian Council for International Cooperation, interview, January 10th, 2018). It cannot be assumed, therefore, that all women's organizations want to, or feel the need to, be part of the humanitarian system if they see the humanitarian system as failing to meet the needs of women or perceive themselves as better able to achieve their gender justice aims outside of it.

In contrast, among 15-24-year-old males and 25-34-year-old males, about 30 percent working in agriculture have lower-secondary education or higher.

Particular migrant groups - including migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons (IDPs) - as well as remittances, were outlined. Chapter 3 focuses primarily at the regional level in order to provide a more detailed picture of migration, which sets out a different, but complementary, perspective of migrants and movements in different parts of the world.1 Our starting point is geographic, rather than thematic, given that geography is one of the fundamentals underpinning migration today, just as it was in the past. Notwithstanding increasing globalization, geography is one of the most significant factors shaping patterns of migration and displacement. Many people who migrate across borders do so within their immediate regions, to countries that are close by, countries to which it may be easier to travel, that may be more familiar, and from which it may also be easier to return.

In indirect selling, an export intermediary, such as an export management company (EMC) or an export trading company (ETC), assumes responsibility for finding overseas buyers, shipping products, and getting paid. A variation on this method is an agent that you engage on a commission basis who finds the buyer for you. U.S. wholesalers can play the role of intermediary, buying goods from the producer and selling them to an end-user outside the United States. The wholesaler takes legal possession of the goods. The benefit for the producers is that their responsibility ends at their delivery dock. The negative is that the wholesaler may receive a better profit margin and the benefits of acquiring valuable expertise from selling to an array of international markets. If the wholesaler only sells to distributors in Canada but there's a bigger demand for your product in Mexico, you'll never know that, and sales that could be won't happen.

Firms adapt by buying generators and other expensive equipment to protect sensitive inventory and machinery. Allcott, Collard-Wexler, and O'Connell (2016) examine the effects of electricity shortages on input choices, revenue, and productivity in manufacturing plants in India between 1992 and 2010. The authors find that electrical shortages reduce the average plant's revenue by 6-8%, and that producer surplus drops by 10%, of which roughly half is due to the cost of backup generators.

Note (a): For example, Birkhaeuser, Evenson, and Feder (1991) found no significant relationship between the provision of traditional extension services and farm productivity in Africa, whereas Evenson (2001) and Dercon et al. (2009) identified some successes. Anderson and Feder (2003) propose an organizational inquiry into which model of extension (public or private) can deliver superior results. With nonagricultural self-employment and work in household enterprises emerging as one of the key contributors to the generation of new jobs, it is important to consider the government's role in equipping the workforce with the right skills for this sector. Evidence is still emerging on which skills are most useful in the household enterprise sector as well as how to cost-effectively develop these skills through large-scale programs. For example, it is not clear whether technical or vocational skills can necessarily lead to employment in a skilled profession, nor whether business or behavioral skills are the most binding constraint to household entrepreneurs when many other constraints, such as access to credit or freedom to operate, are known to exist. And even once a clearer understanding is developed on which skills are most important, it should also be recognized that training programs are not always effective or efficient at delivering these skills, even though programs may be well-funded and politically supported (Blattman and Ralston 2015). Finding a training program model that maintains high participation rates and delivers the skills that participants both want and need for their work has been notoriously difficult to implement in practice. Recent work, as described in Box 6.3, suggests that given these caveats it may be best to provide skill development programs through a more demand-focused and results-driven approach, whereby individuals can seek out an integrate range of skills that are most important to them and programs are funded based on meeting these needs.

In June 2015, India announced a plan to transition its imported food inspection protocol from batch-by-batch inspections and sampling to a risk-based approach. During discussions at the 2016 TPF, Indian officials noted that they are actively working to develop and implement a risk-based inspection system and provided a general overview of their approach. The United States continues to collaborate with India on developing more specific guidance and a timeline to transition its inspections protocols. On April 1, 2016, the Indian Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) launched its single window interface for facilitating trade (swift) system. This is an initiative by the government of India to streamline clearances for inbound consignments and to improve the ease of doing business. Along with SWIFT, the CBIC also introduced an Integrated Risk Management facility for partner government agencies. The facility is designed to ensure that consignments are selected for testing based on the principle of risk management - ensuring that that foods that present actual food safety risks are tested while goods that pose little to no risk can avoid becoming subject to unnecessary procedures by inspection agencies. In the modified Food Import Regulations published September 2, 2016, FSSAI stated that a risk-based random sampling will be followed wherein the samples will be drawn randomly based on the risk factor and compliance history of the importer identified by the newly introduced SWIFT system software. During discussions at the 2016 TPF, Indian officials noted that they are actively working to develop and implement a risk-based inspection system and provided a general overview of their approach. However, market sources report that the risk-based inspection system is not yet fully operational as software linking with SWIFT and mapping by CBIC is still in being developed.

Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants' journeys. Being in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move. Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities. In particular, there has been a mounting pressure on the first countries of asylum to double efforts to locally integrate refugees they are hosting. However these countries struggle to meet the social and economic needs of refugees who often face discrimination. As described in an article, the desire to move on with their lives and escape the interminable temporariness in Turkey propelled some Syrian refugees to engage in secondary movements throughout the EU, despite the risks of the journey. For similar reasons, the vast majority of one million refugees who landed in Greece and Italy in 2015-2016, then engaged in secondary movements to escape the temporary status and the exploitative economies of transit. Another contribution shed light on the situation of asylum seekers confined in Indonesia and who hope to be resettled in Australia. It demonstrated that limbo in transit encouraged migrants to agree to assisted voluntary return, in many cases, to places where they may face persecution.

One such assumption is the location of a standardized business--the subject of the Doing Business case study--in the largest business city of the economy. The reality is that business regulations and their enforcement may differ within a country, particularly in federal states and large economies. Gathering data for every relevant jurisdiction in each of the 190 economies covered by Doing Business is infeasible. Nevertheless, where policy makers are interested in generating data at the local level, beyond the largest business city, and learning from local good practices, Doing Business has complemented its global indicators with subnational studies. Also, starting with Doing Business 2015, coverage was extended to the second-largest city in economies with a population of more than 100 million (as of 2013).

Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school. The project program implies long-term comprehensive training, which is designed for a period of up to 9 years and can take place in parallel with the basic educa1on and in addi1on to it; 4. Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project. The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy. The total number of employees and developers is about 100 people; 5.

The meetings were designed to seek input on identification of a geographical focus, existing knowledge, priorities, gaps, and the potential for partnerships. In addition, the K-State team was interested in identifying needs in geospatial and farming systems research, capacity building, gender, nutrition, appropriate scale mechanization and effective communication strategies for the local partners. These participatory events produced volumes of useful information that serves as the foundation, focus, and rationale for the proposed SIIL. As indicated in the proposal, the selection of the of the geographical focus, countries, partners, and areas of inquiries were based on the country-defined priorities and with active engagement of the various stakeholders, value chain partners, government organizations, national agricultural research systems (NARS), international centers including Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centers, nongovernmental agencies (NGOs) and private industry.

The Ecological Footprint of carbon dioxide emissions is calculated by assuming that all emissions must be taken up by forests. This neglects biotic carbon uptake in other biomes, which if included might affect the estimated Ecological Footprint per unit of carbon dioxide emissions. * Bioproductivity occupied by hydroelectric reservoirs and other infrastructure. These areas are assumed to have world average productivity. Greater specificity would be desirable. * Ecological tradeoffs of land conversion. By the current National Footprint Accounts methodology, loss of forest cover to urbanization may provide counter-intuitive results in biocapacity. This is due to a lack of geographic specificity. All cropland is assigned the global average equivalence factor, weighted by yield. This means that if national average yields are not substantially affected, newly added cropland hectares may be assigned a higher biocapacity than the land cover they replace. In addition, all land occupied by infrastructure is assumed to have the biocapacity per hectare of cropland, rather than of the land cover it has displaced. * Aquaculture production.

Different studies for Chile have reached both results.14 Overall, the ma- noncompetitive labor markets.6 By establishing a reference wage, minimum wages can even benefit uncovered workers through the so-called lighthouse effect.7 EPL and minimum wages are also seen as creating the conditions for human capital accumulation and associated productivity gains.8 Critics of strong EPL and minimum wages hold that they tend to reduce employment, hinder productivity growth, and can lead to divisions in society between those who benefit from the regulations and those who do not. According to this view, to the extent that EPL and minimum wages raise labor costs, they can increase poverty by pushing low-skilled workers, young people, and women into unemployment or into informal sector jobs.9 Hiring and termination restrictions can slow down labor reallocation and hence constrain productivity growth.

At least 30 detainees were released during the year; however, the National Security Service (NSS) and the Military Intelligence Directorate continued to conduct arbitrary arrests and hold perceived government opponents in prolonged detention without charge or trial. Individuals were denied the right to have their detention reviewed by a court and were often subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. Detention conditions were harsh; detainees were regularly denied access to their family members, adequate food and clean water. The conditions, including inadequate medical care, contributed to the deaths of some detainees. The NSS released 21 detainees without charge from prolonged arbitrary detention in a prison in the NSS headquarters compound in the Jebel neighbourhood of Juba; one was released in January, two in March, one in April, two in May, and 15 in August. Most had been detained for between two and three years. At least five others remained in detention in the compound, accused of communicating with or supporting the opposition. A sixth man, James Gatdet, former SPLM/A-IO spokesperson, detained in the same facility, was charged with inciting violence, ""treason"" and ""publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to Southern Sudan"". He was detained after he was forcibly returned from Kenya to South Sudan in November 2016.4 Mike Tyson, Alison Mogga Tadeo, Richard Otti, and Andria Baambe, also held without charge for alleged links with the opposition, died in the same facility between February and July as a result of harsh conditions of detention and inadequate access to medical care.

Most qualitative studies described positive attitudes towards financial payments (136-142). Financial incentives in general appear to be well accepted, provide motivation and recognition, and may bring a sense of financial independence and self-confidence to CHWs. CHWs can incur out-of-pocket expenditures for communication and transport; ensuring timely and complete payment of incentives to compensate for this was reported to be most important. The reputation of the CHW, as based on trust and respect from the community, can be negatively impacted by performance-based incentive schemes, which were described as at times being too narrowly focused on pre-identified indicators, leading to activities and efforts not linked to these indicators being ignored and unacknowledged. Performance-based incentives encouraged uneven focus on certain activities due to their association with higher incentives, especially when CHWs had no basic remuneration, leading to the neglect of other important activities or responsibilities. Other CHWs expressed dissatisfaction with performance-based incentive models in relation to amounts paid and inconsistent and incomplete payment of incentives (45, 143).

Growth is driven by demand for quality education among the emerging middle-income segment. Privately-funded primary and secondary schools are generally perceived by parents as worthwhile investments for their children, and those who can afford to do so will typically send their children into private education. Most private schools are based in cities. However, there are also a number of good public schools that provide higher-than-average standards of education, and place greater emphasis on English language education. These are popular among low-and middle-income families. These schools are also mainly located in urban areas, where there are more qualified teachers and greater resources. Both public and private schools are making every effort to improve the quality of their English tuition. Private schools believe that using English as a medium for teaching will help them to stand out from other schools. A comparison of interviews with public and private institutions reveals that private education places greater emphasis on English language education and commits more resources to it than public education. Education with English as a teaching medium in public high schools is of lower quality, as teachers in these schools generally speak less fluent English than their counterparts in private schools.

cffebf6a-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor153.txt	A new initiative, the Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas (ICCA) Registry (www.iccaregistry.org), has been developed in response to a growing recognition that local communities and indigenous peoples play a significant role in protecting and maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services but there has been no consistent way to measure and document the values and roles of communities in conservation. The Registry, using the same structure as the WDPA, stores two types of information: (1) descriptive information, such as the main habitats within the ICCA and the management features of the community or communities living within or near the ICCA, and (2) spatial information, such as the size and location of the area. It is planned that the Registry will be linked to the WDPA for enhanced access to information about protected areas and ICCAs and will serve as a mechanism to increase information in the WDPA about diverse forms of protected area governance. The Registry adheres to the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), whereby communities must give their consent prior to participating in a project that may affect them. An advisory group is being established to ensure validation of communities who register; this will maintain credibility of the process. Of the three defining elements of ICCAs recorded on the registry, the third--'The voluntary management decisions and efforts of the concerned community lead to, or at least are well in the process of leading to, the conservation of biodiversity, habitats, species, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless of the original management objectives as perceived by the community'--is similar to the IUCN definition of a protected area.

In the second half of the year, prosecutors investigated at least one protester for ""false reporting"" after he claimed that the police had tortured him. Courts also convicted and imprisoned journalists and activists on vague and overly broad state security and terrorism offences in what amounted to punishment for their criticism of the authorities. Between May and August, security forces arrested and detained eight journalists and bloggers over critical coverage or online commentary of the protests in Rif. Prosecutors charged them with protestrelated, state security offences. Hamid El Mahdaoui was convicted of inciting others to take part in an unauthorized protest and sentenced to three months' imprisonment and a fine of 20,000 dirhams (around USD2,100), increased to one year's imprisonment on appeal. Seven people, including journalists, activists and the academic Maati Monjib, remained on trial on charges including ""threatening state security"" for promoting a mobile application for citizen journalism that protected users' privacy. Journalist Ali Anouzla remained on trial on trumped-up charges of ""advocating, supporting and inciting terrorism"" for an article he had published on the website lakome.com in 2013.

Before reforms were implemented, these economies suffered from large distortions caused by a rigid planning system, which prevented resources from flowing to more efficient uses. Liberalization led to massive downsizing and job losses. Eventually, it also strengthened incentives, mobility, and markets, opening up space for more productive private companies. The entry of these dynamic players contributed between 20 and 50 percent of total labor productivity growth in the late 1990s. The exit of obsolete firms released resources that could be used more effectively by new or existing firms. Although lack of experience and small turing plants operating in Chile over 2001-06 were successful downsizers, consistent with the popular perception.

To understand how much jobs contribute to development, it is necessary to assess these effects--the spillovers from jobs. Jobs that generate positive spillovers have a greater value to society than they have to the individual who holds the job, while the opposite is true when spillovers are negative. Intuitively, many people have notions about such broader payoffs. When asked about their most preferred jobs, respondents in China, Colombia, Egypt, and Sierra Leone give different answers from those they offer when asked to identify the most important jobs to society (figure 11).

In ecology, resilience is the degree to which a system can adapt, learn, and self-organize (Walker et al. 2004). Resilience to disasters is the ability to manage change, by maintaining or transforming living standards in the face of shocks without compromising long-term prospects (DFID 2011). Recognizing the strength of resilience as a concept to guide understanding of system response to change and exogenous shocks, researchers and policy makers are utilizing the concept to address development challenges (Barrett and Constas 2014, Bene et al. 2016b). In this context, the concept of resilience has been adapted to be cognizant of issues such as marginality, power, and agency and associated social and institutional structures that the vulnerability literature has flagged as being important to explain differential susceptibility to harm (Bene et al. 2012, 2014, Tanner et al. 2015). Recent definitions of resilience, adopted herein, describe it as a capacity, possessed by a unit, e.g. household, community, or country, to maintain or improve standards of living while facing an uncertain risk landscape (Barrett and Constas 2014).

cffebf8c-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor82.txt	Unfair trials were commonplace, particularly in politically motivated proceedings, during which suspects were typically detained and charged without access to a lawyer of their choice. Police continued using torture and other ill-treatment to extract forced confessions which were later used by judges as incriminating evidence. Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment were not effectively investigated. On 25 January, the Baku Serious Crimes Court sentenced 18 men associated with the Shi'ite Muslim Unity Movement (MUM) in Nardaran to lengthy prison terms. Their trial did not meet international standards of fairness and was marred by numerous torture allegations. During the trial, the defendants complained of having been tortured into 84 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 signing confessions. Witnesses called by the prosecution also said that they had been threatened by police into incriminating MUM defendants. The forced testimonies were admitted by court and used by the prosecution throughout the trial. Elgiz Garhaman, a NIDA Youth movement activist, was sentenced to five and a half years in prison on fabricated drug-related charges following an unfair trial. He was denied access to lawyers of his choice, and kept incommunicado for a week following his detention. During the trial, he told the judge the police had beaten, threatened and humiliated him into signing a confession. The judge refused to order an investigation into his allegations, dismissing them as groundless. On 1 December, the amendments to the Code of Civil and Administrative Procedure excluded lawyers without Bar Association (Collegium of Lawyers) membership from court proceedings.

At least 11 people were convicted under blasphemy laws. Individuals belonging to minority religions or faiths or holding minority beliefs were often targeted for prosecution. On 9 May, Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian known as Ahok, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for ""insulting Islam"" in a video posted on the internet. Ahok was the first high-ranking government official to be convicted of blasphemy.4 On 7 March, Ahmad Mushaddeq, Mahful Muis Tumanurung and Andry Cahya, leaders of the disbanded Fajar Nusantara religious movement known as Gafatar, were convicted of blasphemy by the East Jakarta District Court. The conviction was upheld by the Jakarta High Court on 3 July. At the end of the year, at least 30 prisoners of conscience remained in detention for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression or of religion and belief. On 4 June, the local government in Depok, West Java, sealed a mosque belonging to the Ahmadiyya religious minority, considered by many Islamic groups to be ""deviant and outside of Islam"". Authorities prevented the Ahmadis from using the mosque during Ramadan. The Depok Mayor argued that the legal basis for the closure of the mosque was a ministerial decree and a provincial regulation, both forbidding Ahmadiyya community members from promoting their activities and spreading their religious teachings.

Limited evidence suggests that addressing existing social and gender hierarchies, and taking into account health care system limitations, may support the effectiveness of community engagement strategies in CHW programmes. Social and structural obstacles that may impede or undermine the effectiveness of community engagement in improving CHW programme performance include stigma, poverty, marginalization of women, lack of access to health care, and programme funding limitations. Several qualitative studies specifically indicated the negative impact of barriers to fair and equitable CHW selection processes on CHW performance and utilization; these appear to operate both internally through undermining CHW commitment and satisfaction, and externally through undermining community trust in CHWs and CHW programmes. Thus while 10 studies involved community leaders in selecting and hiring CHWs, this should probably be interpreted as a different intervention than involvement of community members in the CHW selection process (11 studies) - though some studies report both. Cautionary evidence emerged with respect to the potential for this mechanism of community engagement to create tension with and within local authorities and other stakeholders.

Since these children tend to remain hidden, it is difficult to estimate the extent of the problem. There have been reports in some communities of 80 per cent to 90 per cent of children with disabilities not having birth certificates.786 However, other available data from two countries lead to different conclusions at the national level. In the Maldives, in 2009, the birth registration coverage of children aged 2 to 4 with and without disabilities were similar,787 and in Angola in 2016, more children and youths with disabilities under the age of 18 had been registered at birth than children and youths of the same age without disabilities (Figure II.138). A child may need to be registered to access services, which may be particularly important for the survival and overall development of children with disabilities, and this may act as an incentive for families to register children with disabilities. These findings should be interpreted with caution because if families are hiding and not registering children with disabilities, they are likely not reporting information about them when interviewed in surveys.

However, the gap between persons with and without disabilities in employment is not only due to differences in demographic characteristics. Although the lower education levels often achieved by persons with disabilities impact access to employment, other factors also appear to play a significant role in limiting job opportunities. These include discrimination, stigma, negative attitudes, lack of accessible transportation to get to work, and inaccessible workplaces with limited availability of accommodations for persons with disabilities.383 For example, in eight developing countries, an average of 32 per cent of persons with disabilities reported that their workplace is hindering or not accessible (Figure II.78). In many countries, laws regulating labour still lack protections against discrimination on the grounds of disability (see section on Goal 10). Due to these obstacles, many persons with disabilities who are capable of working are not able to secure a job and remain an underutilized segment in the labour force.384 Figure II.77.

The first allowed for administrative control measures on individuals, including travel bans and restrictions on movement and contact with certain persons, without providing sufficient safeguards against arbitrary and discriminatory use. The second administrative law enabled the revocation of Dutch nationality of dual citizens who are suspected of having travelled abroad to join an armed group. The laws did not provide for a meaningful and effective appeal. In July, the law on the Intelligence and Security Services was adopted. It gave sweeping surveillance powers to intelligence and security services, threatening the rights to privacy, freedom of expression and nondiscrimination. Safeguards against abuse of these powers were insufficient. Serious concerns remained about the possibility of information-sharing with intelligence agencies in countries that might use such information to target human rights defenders and government opponents. Any person suspected or convicted of terrorism-related offences continued to be automatically placed in a specialized highsecurity prison where they were subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment.

Therefore, the percentages presented throughout this section refer to the full sample and not only to the sample of individuals for whom we have information regarding each indicator. 26 According to Ryan and Deci (2000, 235-236), external regulation ""is the classic case of extrinsic motivation in which people's behavior is controlled by specific external contingencies. People behave to attain a desired consequence such OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 26 motivations occur when one's action is effectively coerced. Introjected motivations are those in which the respondent acts to please others or to avoid blame--regardless of whether or not he or she personally values this particular course of action. Identified motivations, which are here associated with empowerment, occur when the person's actions are shaped based on his or her own values. Because motivations are often mixed in real life--we act in part to please others as well as based on our own personal convictions--RAI enables the respondent to articulate the extent to which his or her actions are shaped by all three motivations. If the motivation related to the person's own values are relatively stronger than the others, then the person has adequacy in autonomy."

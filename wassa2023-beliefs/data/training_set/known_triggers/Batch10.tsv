Growth is driven by demand for quality education among the emerging middle-income segment. Privately-funded primary and secondary schools are generally perceived by parents as worthwhile investments for their children, and those who can afford to do so will typically send their children into private education. Most private schools are based in cities. However, there are also a number of good public schools that provide higher-than-average standards of education, and place greater emphasis on English language education. These are popular among low-and middle-income families. These schools are also mainly located in urban areas, where there are more qualified teachers and greater resources. Both public and private schools are making every effort to improve the quality of their English tuition. Private schools believe that using English as a medium for teaching will help them to stand out from other schools. A comparison of interviews with public and private institutions reveals that private education places greater emphasis on English language education and commits more resources to it than public education. Education with English as a teaching medium in public high schools is of lower quality, as teachers in these schools generally speak less fluent English than their counterparts in private schools.

The emphasis on families in the migration literature continues to grow, and International Migration has been among those journals to feel this emphasis. A major interest is with those family members who are leftbehind, the emotional difficulties they may face, as described by Fuller, despite modern ICTs; the effects on schooling as described by Yabiku and Agadjanian and, separately, by Kuepie; and the effects on marriages themselves which, as shown by Davis and Jennings and separately by Silver, et al., can be deeply troubling. But migration can itself be for marriage, and this phenomenon has received a great deal of attention, especially in Asia and especially in South Korea where marriage migration represents a high proportion of all migration to that country.

Similar effects were seen during the Ebola outbreak in 2013 to 2016, with disastrous effects on maternal and neonatal health (Sochas et al., 2017), as well as malaria, TB, and HIV treatment (Parpla et al., 2016). Similar effects on non-maternity reproductive health services have been examined earlier; routine childhood immunisation is also expected to fall due to lack of remaining staff and resources, compounded by international supply bottlenecks. As well as staff shortages, use of services may have been reduced by patient fear of acquiring COVID-19 and by health staff reducing patient attendance in an attempt to decongest facilities.

Its purpose is to build capacity for the provision of taxonomic services, i.e. the identification of, and provision of information on, organisms. This capacity is inter alia essential for: * curbing the spread of IAS, including pests and disease * food security * eliminating poverty, especially among rural people * enhancing international trade in agricultural and horticultural products * conserving biological diversity and preventing the loss of natural ecosystems. For agricultural and horticultural quarantine services, a taxonomist can only be expected to identify a small proportion of the potentially harmful species that may move through any port of importation or exportation. Therefore, using current methods for organism identification, a cadre of taxonomists is needed for effective identification services, and each requires considerable training and years of experience. Building taxonomic capacity that depends on human expertise is, therefore, a long-term, costly exercise. The need, however, is vital, urgent, and massive. It is unrealistic to expect that a sufficient number of competent taxonomists will be trained within the foreseeable future, so new, cost-and time-effective mechanisms for providing identification services must be implemented.

cffebe01-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor164.txt	"The lower proportion of women across all age groups in Eastern and Southern Asia relative to other regions may be a measure of the inequalities faced by women at all stages of the life cycle. The term ""missing women,"" coined by Amartya Sen18 and used extensively in the literature since then, refers to the high sex ratios observed in some Asian countries, such as China and India, compared to those found in developed countries (and in many countries in developing regions). In other words, the number of ""missing women"" is the number of additional women that would be found if these countries had the same sex ratios as areas of the world in which women and men received the same treatment and care. The higher mortality of women compared to other countries with similar overall levels of mortality and similar epidemiological conditions is an indicator of the neglect of girls and gender inequality. The sex ratio at birth (as shown above) and the relatively higher female mortality in childhood (see Chapter 2 on Health) play a key role in explaining the lower than expected numbers of women in some countries. More recent research points out that the ""missing women"" phenomenon can also be explained by premature deaths among women in later age groups.19 Among the other developing regions, Western Asia has the most distinct demographic profile, characterized by a much higher number of men than women at adult working ages, peaking in the 35 to 39 age group (figure 1.4). Western Asia also has the largest percentage of international migrants among its population and the only region where international migration has a significant impact on the sex ratio at adult ages. Large scale male-dominant labour migration to many Western Asian countries has brought the sex ratio of the adult population to unusually high levels. International migrants constitute nearly a third of the male population between the ages of 25 and 44 in that region. For women, the share of international migrants in the total female population in Western Asia is one in seven (figure 1.7). 18 Sen, 1992. 19 See, for example, Anderson and Ray, 2010; World Bank, 2011; Milazzo, 2014."

In a 2010 report Suranjana Gupta and Irene Leung found that ""women's organizations have shown extraordinary capacities to mobilize women survivors to improve distribution of aid, access to resources, water and shelter, and making local institutions accountable in relief and rehabilitation"" (p. 1). Yet they also found that this contribution goes unrecognized and that ""women's organizations are forced to negotiate afresh to ensure their active participation in relief and rehabilitation processes"" (Gupta and Leung 2010, 1). Therefore when analyzing women's leadership in the context of LHL--a term that started being more widely used around 2014--it is important to keep in mind that a dearth of examples of women's leadership related specifically to LHL does not reflect a lack of women's leadership in the context of humanitarian action in general."

These are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries which have failed to develop new industries and services connected to world markets and the jobs that go with them.59 Workers in those countries, however, may not perceive the lost employment opportunities.60 One way to mitigate the welfare losses from globalization, both apparent and hidden, is through the international migration of workers. Income differentials across countries, which reflect differences in the growth rates of different economies, are important drivers of this migration. By reallocating workers from stagnant or slowly growing economies to rapidly growing ones, the international migration of workers contributes to the reduction in the QUESTION 7 Many developing countries face a jobs agenda. In some, it involves offering avenues to rural populations to move out of poverty. In others, it aims at leveraging the gains from urbanization and from integration in global markets. Yet in others, the goal is to prevent youth from becoming disenfranchised or to reduce the risk of conflict. These agendas are addressed through national policies that stimulate job creation by the private sector, especially in the areas and activities where development payoffs are highest. But jobs agendas of individual countries are connected through globalization: trade in goods and services, investment flows, and migration of workers. This begs the question: if jobs can migrate from one country to another, do policies to support job creation in one country become policies affecting jobs in other countries--policies competing for jobs globally? Among economists, the conventional wisdom is that the number of jobs is not determined by international trade and investment but by the total number of people in the labor force. And in general, openness to international trade and foreign direct investment is beneficial for all the countries involved. Thus, globalization is not a zero-sum game. From this point of view, policies to support job creation are not policies competing for jobs, even as they may alter the global flows of trade, investment, and workers.

The idea that jobs can build identity, or might be associated with trust or more participation in society, is often seen as relevant only for a narrow set of occupations in rich countries. Those jobs are perceived as a luxury that developing countries cannot afford. Even those who concede that some jobs can do more for social cohesion in developing countries are skeptical that policies can do much beyond supporting job creation. Given that most employment is in the private sector, it is unclear how or whether the government could influence the nature of the jobs. Some even doubt that jobs on their own lead to greater social cohesion. They view jobs as only one element that can contribute to changing values, attitudes, and behaviors within a complex web of institutional, historical, political, and social factors.

As outlined above, migrants can face challenges in addressing their mental, social and physical well-being needs. Migrants who have limited or no ability to access positive determinants of health (see figure 1) can experience poor health outcomes, with various consequences for public health. This situation could itself be the result of difficulties faced in accessing a secure income, perhaps associated with challenges involved in obtaining the necessary documentation to work legally. Should they be unable to access timely testing and treatment, chances for onward transmission of the disease to others within the community would increase, as would the likelihood of unnecessary costs being incurred by the host healthcare system as a result.

Results show that the number of UNESCO cultural and natural sites, as well as intangible cultural heritage listings, keeps growing, indicating greater commitment to preserving some of the key attractions driving people to visit destinations. Encouragingly, Environmental Sustainability (pillar 9) scores have been boosted by the increase in environmental treaty ratifications and improved perceptions that T&T is being developed in a sustainable manner, all of which bodes well for natural resources and nature-based tourism. While this is promising, the enforcement of treaties and protected lands might not be enough to preserve natural resources, given that air pollution, deforestation and species endangerment have continued to rise over the last two years. Since the last edition of the report, the global average score for perceptions of the stringency and enforcement of environmental regulations improved by just 0.4%. Sadly, these perceptions declined the most in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that already struggles to better utilize its natural assets. As a result, it is vital that T&T stakeholders recognize their role in environmental protection, or they run the risk of losing out on future nature tourism.

It may sometimes be difficult to draw a clear line between volunteers who wish to remain volunteers (for instance because they have a different full-time job, and only dedicate a few hours per month to voluntary community service), and the CHWs without an alternative source of livelihood who are currently not receiving any financial package for their work.

CoRAP is part of the REACH substance evaluation process and is updated every March. Its purpose is to allow Member States and the European Chemicals Authority (ECHA) to prioritize substances they suspect of being hazardous to human health or the environment. Depending on the outcome of the evaluation, a substance evaluated under CoRAP may be considered for classification as a substance of very high concern and become subject to authorization and restriction procedures. It is also possible that after evaluation, a substance will be found to pose no such risk. ECHA has established criteria for selecting substances for placement on the list. These criteria address concerns about hazard, exposure, and tonnage. Member States are encouraged, but not obliged, to use the ECHA criteria. ECHA published the most recent CoRAP list on March 20, 2018. It contains 108 substances for evaluation by the Member States. CoRAP preliminary reports should be made available to interested U.S. companies, even if they have not yet registered the particular substance, but the reports are made available only to registrants. The EU should undertake to improve the transparency of the CoRAP process, including by publishing CoRAP preliminary reports, which would both contribute to the EU's objectives and address U.S. stakeholders' concerns by helping reduce costs.

This indicator probes the person's own understanding of the situation and how he or she balances different motivations--to avoid punishment or social disapproval and to act on his or her own values (Alkire 2007). The indicator adapts the measure of autonomy developed by psychologists Richard Ryan, E. L. Deci, Valery Chirkov, and others working in Self-determination Theory (see Chirkov, Ryan, and Deci 2011). A subindex is constructed from answers to the following: (1) My actions in [area of decision-making] are partly because I will get in trouble with someone if I act differently, (2) Regarding [area of decision-making] I do what I do so others don't think poorly of me, and (3) OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 9 Regarding [area of decision-making] I do what I do because I personally think it is the right thing to do. The areas of decision-making refer to (1) agricultural production, (2) which inputs to buy, (3) which types of crops to grow, (4) when to take or who would take crops to market, and (5) livestock production. An individual is adequate on autonomy if his or her actions are relatively more motivated by his or her own values than by coercion or fear of others' disapproval. Note that this autonomy indicator, unlike decision-making indicators, captures the situation of women living in female-only households, who may indeed be empowered as sole decision makers but whose autonomy may still be deeply constrained by social norms or force of circumstance. It also reflects the situation in joint households--a joint decision may be more or less autonomous, depending on circumstances.

According to shipping industry reports, Apapa in Lagos is the most expensive port in the world for shipments from the United States, due to an average delay of 30 days to clear a container ship. Because of a lack of space at Lagos ports, ships often queue for days, and in some cases weeks and months, before being able to berth and discharge their contents. Nigeria estimates that it loses $55.6 million daily because of traffic gridlock at the main port in Lagos. In a December 2015 report on the causes and implications of Nigeria's large informal economy and unrecorded trade, UK-based think tank Chatham House cited port congestion, trucking traffic congestion, and long cargo clearance times of up to several days as incentives for diverting Nigeria-bound trade to other 370 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS ports in the region with subsequent informal entry into Nigeria.

The past several years have seen a worldwide proliferation of graduate programs and think tanks specializing in migration issues. At the same time, the rising political salience of migration has created a growing need for policy makers, journalists and NGO professionals in other areas to gain working familiarity with migration issues. In view of these trends, in the past two years Migration Studies has run two series 333WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 intended to contribute to the theory and practice of higher education on this topic.

Mexican criminals use bribery, intimidation, and violence to protect their drug trafficking, kidnapping-for-ransom, fuel-theft, gunrunning, extortion, and alien-smuggling enterprises.  Gangs based in Central America, such as MS-13, continue to direct some criminal activities beyond the region, including in the United States. Transnational organized crime almost certainly will continue to inflict human suffering, deplete natural resources, degrade fragile ecosystems, drive migration, and drain income from the productive--and taxable--economy.  Human trafficking generates an estimated $150 billion annually for illicit actors and governments that engage in forced labor, according to the UN's International Labor Organization.

Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of oneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer's perspective. Some varia articles 340 Appendices focus on the links between film and migration experiences in countries with a film industry. In what way do cinema and photography open up new discursive spaces?

At the same time there are other, very effective green house gases such as methane. In this respect the Footprint is blind. Yes some aspects are still excluded.

Rapid growth and strengthening institutions in Brazil and Chile have made them recent exceptions. In both cases, changes in labor market regulation have had limited effect. Patient accumulation of human capital and sustained growth have paid off. But strengthened rule of law, effective policies, and a better perception of the role of the state have also helped.

cffebe40-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor9.txt	In this chapter . . . * Factors to consider in making financing decisions * Private sources of financing * Government sources of financing Export financing is often a key factor in a successful sale. Contract negotiation and closure are important, but ultimately your company must get paid. Exporters naturally want to get paid as quickly as possible, whereas importers usually prefer to delay payment until they have received or resold the goods. Because of the intense competition for export markets, making a sale often depends on your ability to offer attractive payment terms. You should be aware of the many financing options open to you so that you can choose the most acceptable one to both the buyer and your company. In many cases, government assistance in export financing for small and medium-sized businesses can increase your company's options. Before making financing decisions, you should consider: * The need for financing to make the sale. In some cases, favorable payment terms make a product more competitive: A buyer who had preferred buying from someone else might buy your product instead because of shorter or more secure credit terms. On the other hand, a sale can be lost if the competition offers better terms on a similar product. * The length of time the product is being financed. The term of the loan required determines how long you will have to wait before you receive payment from the buyer and influences your choice of how to finance the transaction. * The cost of different methods of financing. Interest rates and fees vary, and an exporter may expect to assume some or all of the financing costs. Before submitting a pro forma invoice to the buyer, you must understand how those costs affect price and profit. * The risks associated with financing the transaction. The riskier the transaction, the harder and more costly it will be to finance. The political and economic stability of the buyer's country can also be an issue. To provide financing for either accounts receivable or the production or purchase of the product for sale, the lender may require the most secure methods of payment--a letter of credit (possibly confirmed) or export credit insurance or a guarantee.

PROMER focused on strengthening and professionalizing rural entrepreneurship and improving the overall political, legal, and institutional environment for such enterprises. For its target population --rural youths and women ages 18-35 who were poor, unemployed, and out of school and who either operated or wanted to start an enterprise -- PROMER provided a combination of technical and management training and funding. Technical skills training primarily involved agribusiness, including food processing, and provided skills to 700 entrepreneurs in metalworking, equipment manufacturing, textile and clothing production, and hygiene and quality monitoring. Management training was provided to about 500 entrepreneurs. The project cost CFAF 10 billion from 2006 to 2013.

To consider only one of those questions would be to neglect relevant information 21 ; therefore, the two questions are aggregated into one indicator. 22 For example, if a wife takes care of finances because her husband has no interest in finances but the husband feels that he could have input if he wanted to, then both would be empowered in that indicator.

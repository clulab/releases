To achieve these objectives, Governments should make efforts to systematically review how women benefit from public sector expenditures; adjust budgets to ensure equality of access to public sector expenditures, both for enhancing productive capacity and for meeting social needs; and achieve the gender-related commitments made in other United Nations summits and conferences. To develop successful national implementation strategies for the Platform for Action, Governments should allocate sufficient resources, including resources for undertaking gender-impact analysis. Governments should also encourage non-governmental organizations and private-sector and other institutions to mobilize additional resources. 347. Sufficient resources should be allocated to national machineries for the advancement of women as well as to all institutions, as appropriate, that can contribute to the implementation and monitoring of the Platform for Action. 348. Where national machineries for the advancement of women do not yet exist or where they have not yet been established on a permanent basis, Governments should strive to make available sufficient and continuing resources for such machineries. 349. To facilitate the implementation of the Platform for Action, Governments should reduce, as appropriate, excessive military expenditures and investments for arms production and acquisition, consistent with national security requirements. 350. Non-governmental organizations, the private sector and other actors of civil society should be encouraged to consider allocating the resources necessary for the implementation of the Platform for Action.

cffebfd5-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor164.txt	"Because the poor is defined as a person simultaneously experiencing multiple deprivations, all data used in the assessment have to come from the same source (sample survey or census). While this is theoretically sound, in practice, it may limit the options of dimensions and indicators to be used. For instance, data on some of the dimensions of deprivation, important from a gender and poverty perspective, may not be routinely collected in household surveys used to measure the MPI. This type of constraint may explain why, in the MPI, indicators on living standards are limited to aspects of housing conditions, household assets and consumer durables, without considerations of current levels of income or consumption. Other ""missing"" dimensions of poverty data that appear important to deprived people but are overlooked in large-scale surveys may refer to quality of work, empowerment, physical safety, social connectedness and psychological well-being, as identified by the proponents of MPI.h From a gender perspective, better indicators and, in particular, individual-level indicators of key dimensions of capability are required. However, most of the more than 20 countriesi that have so far implemented an MPI approach in their latest poverty assessments use only household-level data to identify deprivation. For example, in the MPI, a household and all members of that household are considered deprived on the health dimension if: (1) there is at least one household member who is malnourished, or (2) if one or more children in the household died in the past 12 months. These indicators mirror some well-established indicators used to monitor the health dimension of development and poverty at national and subnational levels, such as the proportion of children underweight and the child mortality rate.

Still, youth unemployment reaches alarming levels in some countries (above 40 percent in South Africa since early 2008 and above 50 percent in Spain in early 2012).10 Even in countries where it is relatively low, the youth unemployment rate is twice or more the national average. In addition, a large share of young people are considered ""idle""--not in education, not employed, and not in training or looking for work (figure 1.2).11 In some countries, more than one-third of 15-to 24-year-olds are idle; in most countries, unemployment rates are small compared to idleness rates.12 In many cases, when youth work they do so in unpaid jobs. If paid, they are less likely to have access to social security.13 Although child labor is in decline, it still affects 1 in 8 children (1 in 14 in the case of hazardous work). The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines child labor as any work by a child under age 12 or, for a child above age 12, any work that impedes education or is damaging to health and personal development.

This is evident in the strong enabling conditions created through supportive policies, appropriate technical planning and the establishment of a national restoration monitoring system. The MARN reporting mechanism is not a complex system, and could easily be adopted by other countries. MARN will continue to use it to report progress towards the Bonn Challenge. However, reporting by El Salvador was facilitated by the previous implementation of ROAM, which generated a lot of information that facilitated the estimation of carbon sequestration, biodiversity and job creation. More work will be needed to generate the capacity and tools necessary for continuous reporting on the different aspects of FLR in El Salvador.21 On a broader level, related to the different national submissions to the Barometer, it will be important to clarify within the Barometer what actions can be considered to be FLR approaches under the Bonn Challenge, and which actions - such as restoration of aquatic areas - are not considered to be restoration, or at least not terrestrial restoration. For instance, much of FLR has involved establishing silvopastoral systems in El Salvador. ROAM FLR types include agroforestry as a catch-all term for trees integrated into active agricultural land, which can represent a vast range of practices, including intercropping, home gardens, silviculture and silvopastoral systems. Yet, duringin-country consultations undertaken during protocol piloting in El Salvador, concerns were expressed about a mismatch between the national definitions of agroforestry and silvopastoral systems.

For instance, research findings indicate that there is low correlation between government spending and the performance of the education system.10 Indeed, with similar levels of government expenditure per child, some DCPs have achieved universal primary education, while others remain far from this target. This means that in addition to increasing education expenditure, more must be done to ensure that these resources will effectively improve education outcomes--in particular, learning. 3.2. Improving efficiency in primary education Indicator 13 GPE tracks efficiency in primary education through measuring the impact of repetition and dropout on the resources dedicated to the primary education cycle (Indicator 13). The internal efficiency coefficient (IEC)11 allows estimation of the proportion of the resources that are used for repetition and dropout, which inform the inefficiencies of the system. The indicator calculates the proportion of countries that have an IEC higher or equal to 70 percent, meaning that 30 percent or less of their resources are used for repetition and dropout. However, the lack of data is an impediment to a comprehensive assessment across DCPs. Data since 2010 for Indicator 13 are only available for 25 DCPs, and only six have data for the period 2015-2018, so there are not enough updates to enable reporting against the milestone for this indicator.12 But across the 25 DCPs with available data, the IEC at the primary level sits at 63 percent (59 percent for the 17 FCACs with data). This means that 37 percent of all education spending was used to cover the costs of repetition and dropout in these countries.

Pakistan is well placed to improve levels of English nationally, thanks to a well established history of English use (it is the official language of government) and its historical links with the UK. Individuals are the major demand drivers for English language skills, as they seek to improve their employment prospects. English is considered a key requirement when looking for a new job. English will play an important role in the development of individual economic prosperity, and therefore contribute to the country's long-term growth. Over the course of the research interviewed companies in many sectors stated that having a well educated workforce with English language skills is key for growth, in order to help expand their business both within Pakistan and on the international stage. Currently, English has no competition from other foreign or local languages in business and this is not expected to change in the near future. With regards to individuals, English is not considered a 'first language' in Pakistan. Most Pakistanis use Urdu or their local dialect, however, its uptake is increasing due to perceptions of individuals that they will benefit from higher salaries if they speak the language.

This reversed the common approach to fibre-optic connectivity design - reliability is usually the first prize, but with L.1700, affordable implementation comes first. The next challenge was to identify the cable design realizing the lowest installation cost. The cable for the BIRD solution selected is lightweight thin robust that is based on the submarine cable technologies. To seek for the partners to globally deploy the BIRD solution, it must be recognized that closing the digital divide and coping with COVID-19 should be recognized as the need from prevention of societal loss rather than from pursuit of financial profits. Another point is solution's compliance with ITU standards that is unprecedentedly aiming at closing the digital divide thereby coping with the pandemics today and tomorrow.

From primary school age, students are exposed to the language and then continue, where possible, to improve their skills, all the way up to university. This sharpening of language skills allows access to better salary opportunities in what can be considered a disadvantaged country. The quality of the education system differs by location: in rural areas access to education is limited, although the government is actively looking to find a solution to this problem with increased spending. Currently 17% of government spending in Bangladesh is on education. Improving English skills is viewed as an important means of advancing both individual wealth and the economy of the country. The aim is to create a workforce that can service international companies' direct investment in Bangladesh, who typically use English as a lingua franca. English speakers in the business environment are expected to speak English to at least intermediate level. Furthermore, in some sectors, such as foreign trade and telecommunications, employees are expected to have a good level of English. On top of this, 24 of 30 companies interviewed by Euromonitor indicated that employees with a good command of English advance quicker than those who do not - ultimately resulting in higher salaries. Private education for primary and secondary education will also play an important role in individual growth, with business leaders of the future expected to be primarily privately educated, and with a high level of English.

The returnees who had previously found success working in urban areas in the Central African Republic were frustrated to find themselves in rural surroundings upon return. When assistance to returnees dried up due to donor interests shifting to the insurgency in the Lake Chad region and resulting displacement, Chad was unable to continue to support returnees, and the reintegration support effectively ended.36 Thailand: Migrants' involvement in emergency management as a driver of integration Although migrants caught by the floods in Thailand were a particularly vulnerable group, they also were active members of their communities, providing relief and clean up services where needed and supporting preparedness, response and recovery efforts. This, in turn, made them feel more integrated in their host community. As one male migrant commented: ""Do you know, I even helped the soldiers and Thai citizens make dams against the flood? I lived like a Thai citizen and felt like I had a responsibility to support neighbours to prevent the flood."" Local Thai CSOs reported the involvement of migrants in supporting the communities they lived in, including support for host community members: ""In Samut Sakhon, some groups of migrant workers tried to form support networks and mobilized monks to collect alms as a fund for relief supplies.

Previously their livelihoods had consisted of farming, fishing, informal trading, handicrafts, brewing of traditional alcohol, wood cutting and charcoal making, working on the salt flats, and livestock (cattle). The women did the agricultural work, the trading, and the production of the traditional alcohol. Men worked on the salt flats, fished, and kept livestock. After the floods, the majority of the population received improved housing but had lost their livelihoods. Fishing activities have declined, and farming has been difficult due to the drought. Because of a lack of money in the economy, petty trading has not been revived. The families are mainly surviving on food for work projects two years after the floods. Women continue to try to farm. And some are beginning to keep chickens again. Some of the women said they had started a new business of selling meat from game hunted by the men.

This can have a severe impact on the health, dignity and quality of life of persons with disabilities. In countries where overall access to adequate water and sanitation is lower, the gaps between persons with and without disabilities tend to be wider.

A growing body of literature uses these data. Martincus, Carballo, and Graziano (2015) measure the effects of customs-related delays on firms' exports by studying export transactions data from Uruguay for the period 2002-11, including the actual time it took for these transactions to clear customs. Their findings suggest that a 10% increase in customs delays results in a 4% decline in exports. This effect emanates from higher costs for exporters, which subsequently reduce their foreign sales, as well as for buyers, which appear to reduce their exposure to firms whose deliveries are subject to such delays. Similarly, Hornok and Koren (2015) analyze the impact of administrative per-shipment costs on trade volumes.

Employees include regular employees, workers in short-term employment, casual workers, outworkers, seasonal workers and other categories of workers holding paid employment jobs (ILO, 1993). As economies advance in terms of economic development, the proportion of workers who become wage employees usually increases: this is because ownaccount workers find better opportunities as wage employees. Female labour force participation also tends to be positively related to economic development. As a result, wage trends are affecting an increasing share of the employed population across the world. At the same time, not all people who work are paid employees. Particularly in low-and middle-income countries, many are either self-employed or contributing to family businesses. Such workers receive an income from their work, but not a wage from an employer. Figure A1 shows that the share of paid employees (or wage employees) has increased by about 10 percentage points during the last 20 years, rising from 45.9per cent in 1995 to 54.3per cent in 2017. In developed economies, where the incidence of own-account work is relatively low and female participation is higher, the percentage of wage employees relative to the total employed has remained high and stable during the observed period. The share of paid employees in developing economies remains low (around 20per cent). Consequently, the global increase is driven mostly by emerging countries, which have seen an increase of roughly 12percentage points (from 38.9per cent to 50.5per cent) in wage employees in the two decades since 1995."

Note (a): For example, Birkhaeuser, Evenson, and Feder (1991) found no significant relationship between the provision of traditional extension services and farm productivity in Africa, whereas Evenson (2001) and Dercon et al. (2009) identified some successes. Anderson and Feder (2003) propose an organizational inquiry into which model of extension (public or private) can deliver superior results. With nonagricultural self-employment and work in household enterprises emerging as one of the key contributors to the generation of new jobs, it is important to consider the government's role in equipping the workforce with the right skills for this sector. Evidence is still emerging on which skills are most useful in the household enterprise sector as well as how to cost-effectively develop these skills through large-scale programs. For example, it is not clear whether technical or vocational skills can necessarily lead to employment in a skilled profession, nor whether business or behavioral skills are the most binding constraint to household entrepreneurs when many other constraints, such as access to credit or freedom to operate, are known to exist. And even once a clearer understanding is developed on which skills are most important, it should also be recognized that training programs are not always effective or efficient at delivering these skills, even though programs may be well-funded and politically supported (Blattman and Ralston 2015). Finding a training program model that maintains high participation rates and delivers the skills that participants both want and need for their work has been notoriously difficult to implement in practice. Recent work, as described in Box 6.3, suggests that given these caveats it may be best to provide skill development programs through a more demand-focused and results-driven approach, whereby individuals can seek out an integrate range of skills that are most important to them and programs are funded based on meeting these needs.

A number have also asked whether the index could be modified in various ways. Although some adaptation of the questionnaire may be needed to fit local conditions, the WEAI should be computed from the same set of indicators, based on an intrahousehold survey that asks questions separately of the principal female and principal male in the household (so that the GPI can be computed). Adding questions related to other areas of empowerment (for example, healthcare and other decisions) would be welcome, especially for those organizations that are dealing with broader aspects of women's empowerment besides agriculture. Initially, it would be preferable to compare results of these different types of empowerment or, if they are to be added to the WEAI, to indicate this with a new name. As with other indexes, further refinement of the WEAI is possible as it is updated. Perhaps the greatest contribution of the WEAI may be to define and highlight the domains of empowerment and how multidimensional indices can be used to provide an overall analysis of women's empowerment so that agricultural development programs address all domains. Ex ante assessments of programs should, at a minimum, ensure that interventions do no harm, such as by increasing women's workloads or transferring decision-making or control of income from women to men. Baseline WEAI estimates can further serve as a diagnostic tool to signal key areas for interventions to increase empowerment and gender parity. As illustrated in the pilot study results, the areas of disempowerment of women (and men) differ from country to country; WEAI measures can help to identify who are the key decision makers in different types of production and whether the greatest needs are for resources, credit, leadership, or time.

It has been developed by Saras Sarasvathy and colleagues (see for example Sarasvathy, 2001, Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005, Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011). Effectuation is described as an iterative process of decision making and active commitment seeking that results in creation of new value, where each iteration is started with questions such as ""Who am I?"", ""what do i know?"" and ""Whom do I know?"". Sarasvathy and Venkataraman (2011) propose that entrepreneurship could be regarded as a generic method for creating potentially valuable change by unleashing human potential, and has contrasted this to the scientific method designed to harness mother nature. Viewing entrepreneurship as a generic method holds much promise for the field of entrepreneurial education, but requires emphasis on taking action, value creation and using creativity tools (Neck and Greene, 2011). 64. Effectuation constitutes a useful toolbox for teachers in any domain and on any educational level. A student team can be asked to identify a simple problem in real life they would like to address. Preferably this problem is identified by taking into account the team's diverse interests, competencies and previous experiences. By interacting iteratively with the outside world they can learn more about the problem, the people affected by it and how they can help. They need not be anywhere near a solution when initiating the process, they only need to focus on the next step that needs to be taken to approach the problem and learn more about it. A book by Read et al. (2011) targeted to teachers and practitioners provides ample practical advice when using the effectual approach. This book and its concepts is somewhat venture creation focused, but many of the principles can be applied to value creation processes in all stages of education."

U.S. firms continue to report they find it difficult to succeed against competitors willing to ignore legal standards or engage in bribery and other forms of corruption. Corruption is widely reported to affect government procurement tender processes at both the national and county level. The government has not implemented anti-corruption laws effectively. U.S. firms routinely report direct requests for bribes from all levels of the Kenyan government. The Kenyan government began an anticorruption campaign using the Ethics and Anticorruption Commission (EACC) and Office of the Director of Public Prosecution to open cases against high profile offenders. While some cases brought to light by the EACC have resulted in convictions, no high-profile cases have ended in conviction. Despite efforts to increase efficiency and public confidence in the judiciary, a backlog of cases and continuing corruption - both perceived and real - reduce the credibility and effectiveness of Kenya's judicial system. While judicial reforms are moving forward, bribes, extortion, and political considerations continue to influence outcomes in court cases. An Employment and Labor Relations Court exists in Kenya, but it is plagued by long delays in rendering judgments. As such, foreign and local investors risk lengthy and costly legal procedures.

cffec02c-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor96.txt	The report finds that women's leadership in locally led humanitarian action is limited in both case study countries, with women's leadership facing many of the same challenges as LHL itself. Among the barriers to women's leadership in the examined humanitarian crises are sociocultural notions about what women leaders and women's organizations are able to do. As highlighted by the case studies, the women's organizations that are involved in humanitarian response tend to engage more in traditional service delivery than in strategic gender programming, owing both to the need to conform to the expectations of traditional humanitarian actors in order to access funding opportunities and to the perceived divide between humanitarian, development, and peace programming--a divide that many women's organizations do not recognize. The report underscores the need for humanitarian action to do more to recognize the leadership of women and women's organizations, including by encouraging the participation of women's organizations in LHL-focused spaces such as humanitarian networks like the National Alliance for Humanitarian Actors in Bangladesh and acknowledging their role in peace negotiation processes in South Sudan.

Several incidents were reported of members of dominant castes attacking Dalits for accessing public and social spaces or for perceived caste transgressions. In May, two Dalit men were killed, several injured, and dozens of Dalit homes burned by dominant caste men in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, following a clash between members of the communities. In August, S. Anitha, a 17-year-old Dalit girl who had campaigned against the introduction of a uniform national 190 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 exam for admission to medical colleges, committed suicide, sparking protests in Tamil Nadu. Protesters said the exam would disadvantage students from marginalized backgrounds. Activists said that at least 90 Dalits employed as manual scavengers died during the year while cleaning sewers, despite the practice being prohibited. Many of those killed were illegally employed by government agencies. In August, the Delhi state government said that people who employed manual scavengers would be prosecuted for manslaughter. In November, the UN Special Rapporteur on safe drinking water and sanitation expressed concern that the government's emphasis on building new toilets as part of its Clean India Mission could prolong manual scavenging.

The UK, Australia and Canada are the most popular destinations for overseas study. According to RMMRU, levels of student migration are expected to rise in future as more young people seek opportunities abroad, with improving English language skills cited as one of the most important factors. Several projects were undertaken during the review period by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with funds from the World Bank. These typically aimed to improve overall efficiency in schools, as well as improve access to education. They included projects to recruit more female teachers and improve school management and the curriculum. Projects were also launched to improve teacher training and expand the existing scholarship programme. While not specifically promoting the English language, these improvements will have a significant and positive impact on the standard of English language education in Bangladesh. Four out of five education centres stated that the UK is the leading destination for Bangladeshi students, with 58% indicating the UK as a preferred destination.

Results show that the number of UNESCO cultural and natural sites, as well as intangible cultural heritage listings, keeps growing, indicating greater commitment to preserving some of the key attractions driving people to visit destinations. Encouragingly, Environmental Sustainability (pillar 9) scores have been boosted by the increase in environmental treaty ratifications and improved perceptions that T&T is being developed in a sustainable manner, all of which bodes well for natural resources and nature-based tourism. While this is promising, the enforcement of treaties and protected lands might not be enough to preserve natural resources, given that air pollution, deforestation and species endangerment have continued to rise over the last two years. Since the last edition of the report, the global average score for perceptions of the stringency and enforcement of environmental regulations improved by just 0.4%. Sadly, these perceptions declined the most in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that already struggles to better utilize its natural assets.

The peace and security agenda is a critical element of LHL because it addresses the root causes of the needs and crises to which humanitarian organizations are responding. A report from the International Peace Institute analyzing 40 in-depth country case studies found that ""when women participate and are able to exercise influence, there are positive effects for the likelihood of reaching a peace agreement, the text of the agreement that is produced, and the implementation that follows"" (O'Reilly et al. 2015, 11-12). Nanako Tamaru and Marie O'Reilly noted that ""women's organizations may bridge the gap between the formal process and their communities, particularly when government-led public engagement is absent or insufficient"" (2018, 21)."

cffec03f-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor155.txt	In recent years, the scientific community has come to recognize that introduced species can cause massive ecological, economic, and social disruption. It has been estimated that the invasion of alien species currently poses one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, along with the direct transformation of natural habitats and climate change (Sala et al., 2000). The scale of the IAS problem is enormous; the global economic losses currently attributed to IAS exceed the total economic output of the African continent (Pimental, 2002). Social impacts of IAS are difficult to assess on a global scale. However, some recent, wellpublicized invasions demonstrate that the problems can be significant. For example: introduction of the Nile perch (Lates niloticus) transformed Lake Victoria fisheries and forced a restructuring of communal fishing practices (Bright 1998) and, in the United Kingdom, two introduced livestock diseases (mad cow disease = bovine spongiform encephalopathy and foot-and-mouth disease) caused significant financial losses to the livestock and tourist industries (Meyerson & Reaser, 2003). In the 1980s, the Scientific Committee on Problems in the Environment (SCOPE), a subsidiary body of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), recognized the global nature of the IAS problem and launched the first ever international program to synthesize information on the topic. This program was exceptionally successful; it provided the scientific community with major advances in understanding of the ecological factors that contribute to biological invasions, and increased appreciation among the public and policymakers of the threats IAS pose to both ecosystems and human well-being (Drake & Mooney, 1989).

Given the Organization's focus on the provision of technical assistance and direct support to migrants and Member States, publications produced by IOM outside the realm of research and analysis typically include corporate reports (such as meeting/workshop reports and Migration Initiatives), training materials, handbooks and guides, and information materials for migrants (including graphic novels). It is worth acknowledging the mandate and context within which IOM operates, as well as its status as a United Nations-related organization.24 IOM's role as a service delivery agency over almost 70 years has necessarily shaped how it articulates aspects of migration, including the links between its operations and migration practice, as well as migration policy and governance. Programmatic data, for example, have been a mainstay of IOM migration data - a reflection of IOM's strong and enduring role in migration and displacement, including, for example, the support of internally displaced persons, the resettlement of refugees globally, health assessments, assistance to victims of human trafficking, and support to migrants returning home.

The emphasis on families in the migration literature continues to grow, and International Migration has been among those journals to feel this emphasis. A major interest is with those family members who are leftbehind, the emotional difficulties they may face, as described by Fuller, despite modern ICTs; the effects on schooling as described by Yabiku and Agadjanian and, separately, by Kuepie; and the effects on marriages themselves which, as shown by Davis and Jennings and separately by Silver, et al., can be deeply troubling.

Understanding changes in scale, emerging trends and shifting demographics related to global social and economic transformations, such as migration, help us make sense of the changing world we live in and plan for the future. The current global estimate is that there were around 272 million international migrants in the world in 2019, which equates to 3.5 per cent of the global population.1 A first important point to note is that this is a very small minority of the world's population, meaning that staying within one's country of birth overwhelmingly remains the norm. The great majority of people do not migrate across borders; much larger numbers migrate within countries (an estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009).2 That said, the increase in international migrants has been evident over time - both numerically and proportionally - and at a slightly faster rate than previously anticipated.3 The overwhelming majority of people migrate internationally for reasons related to work, family and study - involving migration processes that largely occur without fundamentally challenging either migrants or the countries they enter. In contrast, other people leave their homes and countries for a range of compelling and sometimes tragic reasons, such as conflict, persecution and disaster.

The first was the increase in humanitarian needs before and during the conflict.

On 14 April, an alliance of religious leaders from across the Pakistani Muslim sectarian spectrum came together to declare that they were unilaterally reopening mosques for congregational prayers, in defiance of government lockdown orders. This prompted the government to negotiate with a committee of religious leaders, agreeing to a 20-point plan for reopening mosques from late April, for Ramadan. The steps included enforcing physical distancing guidelines between worshippers, discouraging the sick and elderly from attending prayers, providing hand sanitiser to congregants, and discouraging socialising within the mosque. The Pakistan Medical Association denounced the decision to permit congregations, saying that requirements for worshippers to remain six feet apart and complete ablutions at home were unlikely to be implemented; certainly, social distancing within the mosques has not been enforced (Shah, 2020).

He deploys the economist's theoretical tool kit to explore questions inspired by his youth in New York. Why do some cities fail while others flourish? What accounts for sky-high housing costs in San Francisco? How does the growth of cities differ in rich and poor countries? ""I have always thought of myself as fundamentally a curious child,"" Glaeser, 52, says. Rather than ""pushing well-established literature forward,"" he seeks to comprehend ""something that I really don't understand when I start out."" While still a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Glaeser made his mark as a theorist of the benefits of agglomeration--the idea that dense and diverse cities are hothouses of innovation, energy, and creativity that fuel economic growth. In the years since, his work has ranged across a breathtaking variety of subjects, from rent control and real estate bubbles to property rights, civil disobedience, and carbon emissions. ""For a couple decades now, Ed has been the leading thinker about the economics of place,"" says Lawrence Summers, a Harvard professor who served as director of the National Economic Council under US President Barack Obama. ""And the economics of urban areas are increasingly being seen as central to broad economic concerns."" Glaeser and Summers are collaborating on a study of the hardening divide between welleducated, affluent coastal regions of the United States and islands of economic stagnation in what they call the ""eastern heartland,"" the interior states east of the Mississippi River. There, in cities like Flint, Michigan, the proportion of prime-age men who aren't working has been rising--along with rates of opioid addiction, disability, and mortality."

The situation is tolerated as people have very low expectations and very little awareness of possible rights to information. Communities were never informed about the amount of money offered to their communities and were rarely informed about what they could expect to receive. The lack of information causes passivity and a lack of critical faculties in the recipients; they are grateful but not sure whether they have received all that is available. For example people were often called to meeting to be counted and put on lists, but not told what for; there were whisper campaigns in Chokwe about the distribution of money that are still carrying on two years after the distribution. Nobody in the communities visited was aware of the full picture. The lack of information led to a sense of powerlessness and dependency. The problem originates in the lack of transparency from all the agencies involved, both government and NGOs. NGOs do not generally reveal their budgets to the local government; the local government does not share financial information with the NGOs; the central government does not reveal the amounts sent to the local government; and, nobody tells the recipients about the possible goods and funds that may be available. Beneficiaries are generally asked to make a shopping list without knowing the amount that can be spent or the range of goods available. The weight of power over information rests squarely with the ""giver"" and not the ""receiver."" Participation remains in its infancy and generally consists of providing a basis to build participation in committees and compliance with a set of rules decided by external agents. For wider participation to take place all the elements involved in decision-making need to strive towards power sharing, including sharing of responsibilities, information, and resources.

No perpetrators were known to have been held to account, particularly for numerous incidents in Papua. EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE Between September 2016 and January 2017, joint police and military forces carried out security operations in Dogiyai, Papua province, during the run-up to the 2017 local elections. On 10 January police officers arbitrarily arrested Otis Pekei when he refused to hand over a knife at a police checkpoint, and detained him at the Moanemani sub-district police station. Later that day, police delivered Otis Pekei's body to the home of his family; the family accused the police of torturing him during detention. No investigation was known to have been conducted. On 1 August in Deiyai, Papua province, police officers arbitrarily opened fire into a crowd of protesters without warning, wounding at least 10 people, including children. Nine police officers were subjected to disciplinary action; no criminal proceedings were known to have been opened. UNLAWFUL KILLINGS The number of killings by police of suspected drug dealers increased sharply, from 18 in 2016 to at least 98 in 2017. Some of the officers involved in the incidents were seconded to the National Narcotics Agency. Police claimed that all the killings were in self-defence or because suspects tried to flee the scene. No independent investigations were known to have been conducted into these killings. The number of deaths escalated after several high-ranking Indonesian officials, including the President, 196 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 advocated during the year for tougher measures to address drug-related crime, including calling for the application of unrestrained lethal force against suspected traffickers.

In February, 21 villagers were killed in an attack by suspected herdsmen in three communities in the Atakad district of Kaura, Kaduna state. Witnesses said the herdsmen killed, looted, and burned the villagers' houses. In June, a communal clash in the Mambilla Plateau of Taraba state left scores of people dead, mostly herdsmen and their families. In September, at least 20 people were killed when suspected herdsmen invaded Ancha village in the Miango district of Jos, Plateau state, after a misunderstanding between villagers and herdsmen residing in the community. In 284 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 October, 27 people were killed by suspected herdsmen in a classroom where they were sheltering after three days of attacks in the Nkyie-Doghwro community of Bassa, Plateau state. In December, herdsmen attacked at least five villages in Demsa LGA in Adamawa state to avenge the massacre of up to 57 people, mostly children, in November in nearby Kikan community. Residents described being attacked by a fighter jet and a military helicopter as they attempted to flee. At least86 people were killed by the herdsmen and air force bombing.

cffec066-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor5.txt	The government publishes tender notices in the local press and sometimes publishes tenders in international magazines and newspapers. On occasion, there is a charge for the bidding documents. Cote d'Ivoire has a generally decentralized government procurement system, with most ministries undertaking their own procurements. The Bureau National d'Etudes Techniques et de Developpement (BNETD), the government's technical and investment planning agency and think tank, sometimes serves as an executing agency in major projects to be financed by international institutions. The government created the Direction des Marches Publics, a centralized office of public bids in the Ministry of Finance, to help ensure compliance with international bidding practices. While the procurement process is open in theory, in practice it is often opaque. There are numerous examples of significant government contracts that were awarded through single-source procurement procedures rather than through public tenders. Some well-entrenched foreign companies, particularly French ones, often appear to have preferred position in securing bid awards as a result of longstanding relations with government officials. Though not formally required, foreign companies often find it essential to partner with a local company in submitting a bid. During negotiations on a tender, the government will often impose local content requirements on foreign companies. In other instances, the government may award sole source bids without a tender, citing as a justification the high technical capacity of a firm or a declared emergency. Many firms continue to point to corruption as an obstacle that affects procurement decisions. At times, the government has cancelled or changed the publicly known result of a tender without giving a clear reason. In one instance, the government entered into commercial discussions with a U.S. company, expressing interest in the product or service of the firm and encouraging it to develop presentations and a work product, only to suddenly declare that the government was no longer interested, after having obtained valuable commercial information from the firm. Cote d'Ivoire is neither a signatory to, nor an observer of, the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement.

The research partners provided feedback on the research questions and process and took the lead on developing interview instruments, selecting interviewees, conducting interviews and FGDs, analyzing data, putting together validation workshops, and writing the case studies. Our role at Oxfam with regard to the case studies produced by the partners was to edit and condense the studies to fit within the overall report. The research partners' connection to and knowledge of gender and local humanitarian dynamics were essential to developing a nuanced analysis. 12 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan We recognize, however, that our partners may only feel so comfortable in navigating that relationship with us, the funder of this research. While we were careful to engage with the research partners throughout the process and made sure to provide spaces for them to share feedback and critiques, we are not sure whether the research partners actually felt comfortable doing so. While this is not an unusual problem, as shown by a recent study on working with local researchers from the Overseas Development Institute, more thinking needs to be done on how to create a comfortable and equal partnership, which requires time and trust (Fast 2019, 6). To alleviate some of these uncomfortable power dynamics, one of our goals was to work closely with the research partners to develop their case studies into a published report and to list them as authors. As we share this work externally, we will seek out presentation and conference opportunities for our research partners and support their participation, so they can be visible partners in dissemination.

These recommendations are mainly directed to international actors, which still tend to hold resources and power in the international humanitarian system and can serve as facilitators or gatekeepers in the integration of women's leadership in locally led humanitarian action. These recommendations could also apply to national and local actors who are in a position to provide funding or access to humanitarian decision-making spaces for women and women's organizations. The recommendations focus on three key aspects: (1) get to know women's organizations, (2) trust their expertise, and (3) try to facilitate their engagement in humanitarian decision-making spaces. Underpinning all these recommendations must be an awareness that women and women's organizations often face greater levels of harassment depending on the sociocultural context, and women leaders experience structural barriers to education and other forms of inequality that may make it difficult for them to access and interact in such spaces.

Therefore, the percentages presented throughout this section refer to the full sample and not only to the sample of individuals for whom we have information regarding each indicator. 26 According to Ryan and Deci (2000, 235-236), external regulation ""is the classic case of extrinsic motivation in which people's behavior is controlled by specific external contingencies. People behave to attain a desired consequence such OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 26 motivations occur when one's action is effectively coerced. Introjected motivations are those in which the respondent acts to please others or to avoid blame--regardless of whether or not he or she personally values this particular course of action. Identified motivations, which are here associated with empowerment, occur when the person's actions are shaped based on his or her own values. Because motivations are often mixed in real life--we act in part to please others as well as based on our own personal convictions--RAI enables the respondent to articulate the extent to which his or her actions are shaped by all three motivations.

There are several ways to evaluate the export potential of your products and services in international markets. The most common approach is to examine the domestic sales of your products. If your company is successful in the U.S. market, there is a good chance that it will also sell in markets abroad, at least in those markets where similar needs and conditions exist.

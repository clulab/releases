A CARE International report highlighted an example from a women's organization in Sudan, where the ""work of the Women's Association in supporting self-protection strategies resulted in greater respect among religious and community leaders, providing them with the status and platform required to challenge more sensitive issues, such as GBV [gender-based violence]"" (Lindley-Jones 2018, 28).

Many animal rights groups oppose the eradication and control of IAS, especially large mammals (Low, 1999, Genovesi & Bertolino, 2001). Human health concerns arise over the application of certain pesticides, such as the use of DDT to control introduced species of mosquitoes in malaria-infested regions (Bright, 1998, Parker, 2001). Some scientists and environmental groups believe that potential biological control agents pose risks of invasion that may exceed those of the IAS already in place (Ouder, 1996, Strong & Pemberton, 2000). There are also instances where different sectors of society place different values on alien species. What some people see as beneficial, others might view as undesirable. Such conflicts of interest are not uncommon and are often associated with intentional introductions (Hattingh, 2001, Reaser, 2001).

In line with this, an average of 22 of 30 companies said that English was important when hiring a new employee. This underlines the fact that English language skills enhance business and trade, while also improving an individual's economic condition.

cffebd2f-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor59.txt	English language quantitative indicators ! Euromonitor International Page 8 Global changes underpin growth of English Throughout the research respondents from private companies stated that English is now the common global language of communication. Levels of English use in Nigeria and Pakistan, for example, are high. This is underpinned by strong historical and cultural relationships with the UK, and driven by a desire for linguistic unity, resulting in a competitive advantage globally. Asia is increasingly doing business in Africa, particularly China, where there is great demand for the continent's raw materials. English is used commonly among these developing countries as a means of bridging the frequently massive linguistic differences. Companies such as MTN Communications and Microsoft have found that both Nigeria and Pakistan offer a more attractive business environment than many other countries as a result of these countries' higher levels of English proficiency, among other factors. English considered important to economic growth English levels are less developed in Bangladesh, Cameroon and Rwanda. However, these countries recognise that a standard language of communication is essential for doing business. In the case of Cameroon and Rwanda, French remains a dominant presence throughout society, from education to business; however, these countries are taking active steps to improve English communication by providing more education in English, and in the case of Rwanda, by shifting the government and education system entirely from French to English. However, both governments believe that English will help increase economic growth, allowing businesses to trade with more countries. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has been promoting the virtues of doing business with Rwanda in the US, Europe and China, by specifically referring to the growing use of English. Most companies interviewed said that staff with English language skills had a strong advantage over other employees. For each of the five researched countries, around two-thirds of interviewees stated that employees with English language skills progress more quickly within the company and that English is beneficial for company growth.

Specifically, the United States is concerned that these measures unnecessarily restrict trade without furthering their safety objectives because they are not based on scientific principles, maintained with sufficient scientific evidence, or applied only to the extent necessary. Moreover, the United States believes there are instances where the EU should recognize current U.S. food safety measures as equivalent to those maintained by the EU because they achieve the same level of protection.

cffebd32-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor75.txt	Similarly, but providing a wider scope than the provision of Convention No.183, the European Union adopted Directive 97/80/EC of 15 December 1997 on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex, which was recast into Directive 2006/54/EC of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation. It deals with any complaints of direct or indirect discrimination based on sex and is also applicable in cases related to pregnant workers or those who have recently given birth, are breastfeeding or are on parental leave; while Article 8 of Convention No. 183 considers only the termination of employment on the grounds of maternity. The EU Directive is intended to enable all persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to have their rights asserted by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent bodies. It shall be for the respondent (the employer, in cases of dismissal) to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment (Article 19). This reversal of the general rules of proof offers a useful means of strengthening the principle of equal treatment and ensures that the principle can be effectively enforced (EC, 2006).

They have several barriers that prevent them from enjoying their right to adequate housing, such as lack of physical accessibility, discrimination and stigmatization, limited access to the labour market, and lack of social housing or community support.624 In particular, deinstitutionalization without the necessary community service compounded by the lack of affordable housing can leave many persons with disabilities homeless.623 Another challenge is limited security of tenure, particularly for persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities whose legal capacity is often neglected: they are rarely able to obtain formal housing contracts and therefore often have to rely on less formal housing contracts.625 This results in their increased vulnerability to forced evictions. In some countries, children with disabilities can be abandoned by families626 and face the risk of being homeless and exploited for the purpose of begging in the streets or elsewhere.627 In addition, gender is also important in homelessness as women with disabilities have a higher risk of violence and, when escaping violence, emergency shelters may not be accessible to them.623 In shelters, persons with disabilities, particularly those with psychosocial disabilities, are often turned away because of lack of accommodations to respond to their needs.628 Figure II.119.

This activity was not mandated by the program design, but this happened because the participants, especially in the host countries, were interested in development.

cffebd36-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor5.txt	Kazakhstan continues to enforce CU regulations covering agricultural biotechnology products, which require the labeling of both imported and domestically produced agricultural biotechnology products. As Kazakhstan continues to integrate into the EAEU, it is expected that the policies and views of other EAEU countries will play a greater role in shaping the regulation of agricultural biotechnology in Kazakhstan. An amendment to the 2003 Law on Seeds Farming restricts new testing and prohibits the commercial growth of genetically engineered seeds. However, biotechnology research may be conducted in laboratory greenhouses, and in 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology (under the Ministry of Education and Science) developed a transgenic breed of cotton with higher pesticide resistance. In 2012 and 2013, Kazakhstan and Russia both banned the importation of GE-corn NK603 as a result of a published study by a French scientist questioning the safety of that type of GE-corn. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refuted the scientific validity of the study and noted it should not be considered as valid for risk assessment. Russia removed the ban without any public acknowledgement, and Kazakhstan has not made public the status of its ban. Therefore, it is effectively still in place, and no one has attempted to import this line of corn.

These mechanisms included the use of military justice, arrests without a warrant, and the use of ambiguous and discretionary criminal definitions, among others, that demonstrated a much broader pattern of efforts to silence dissent.1 At the end of the year, 12 of these people were granted alternative measures to detention; the other 10 remained arbitrarily detained, although the courts had ordered the release of many of them. These documented cases included those of MP Gilber Caro and activist Steyci Escalona, both members of the opposition party Popular Will, who were arbitrarily detained in January after senior government authorities publicly accused them of carrying out ""terrorist activities"". Despite Gilber Caro's trial requiring authorization by Parliament, he remained arbitrarily detained and his case was submitted to military courts. Steyci Escalona was granted conditional release from pre-trial detention in November. By the end of the year, neither had been brought to trial. Hundreds of people reported that they were arbitrarily detained during the protests that took place between April and July. Many were denied access to medical care or a lawyer of their choice and in many cases were subjected to military tribunals.

cffebd3a-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor93.txt	For this survey, a household is a group of people who live together and take food from the same pot. The important part of this definition is that the group of individuals shares at least some common resources and makes some common budget and expenditure decisions. A household member is someone who has lived in the household at least six months and at least three days in each week in those months. Even those persons who are not blood relations (such as servants, lodgers, or agricultural laborers) are members of the household if they meet these qualifications, and alternatively, individuals who sleep in the household but do not bear any costs for food or do not take food from the same pot are not considered household members. This definition, including more specific examples and guidelines, is found in the survey enumeration manual and embedded in questionnaires. In some cases, it may make sense to add or subtract from the definition used in the pilot or to substitute an alternative definition for a certain context; however, the most important part is that enumerators have the same understanding of definitions so that implementation is consistent across households. Research from IFPRI and others has found that household definition can have significant impacts on variation of outcome indicators, particularly surrounding labor and consumption (Beaman and Dillon 2012).

This income became the main contribution to the local economy, together with remittances sent by those ex-Misima Mines Limited employees who found work in large mines elsewhere.44 And even in mining areas, social impacts are more mixed than the positive effect on living standards suggests. The influx of money from mining enclaves has enabled men to pay high prices for brides and marry multiple wives on an unprecedented scale, which might have contributed to a decline in women's status. Around Porgera Mine, the abandonment of older wives and the increasing number of women taken from other tribal groups are considered factors in the increased incidence of domestic violence and tension with neighboring groups. In Lihir, when groups of landowners received compensation and royalty payments, no women were given authority to control the accounts.45 In addition, children normally help out in artisanal and small-scale mines. In Misima, because of clear restrictions and training by the Wau Small-Scale Mining Center, children are less involved in mining than before, but child labor remains a con- Artisanal mining can flourish in parallel with major investments and raise the living standards of local communities. In Papua New Guinea, the number of grassroots alluvial miners is two to three times greater than the number of people working in the formal extractive industries sector, even if contractors and temporary workers are counted among the latter. Some of the large extractive projects, such as Ok Tedi Mine, happen to be in poor areas. Thus, the artisanal mining taking place around them helps spread the wealth.

The findings of the systematic review were limited in scope, and did not directly compare alternative modalities for the delivery of pre-service education. Therefore, the GDG considered as a basis for the recommendation also the broader evidence emerging from the review of reviews and indirect evidence on health worker education, recognizing the limitations and caveats of applying it to CHWs as well. 7.4.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.4) addressing the question - ""For CHWs receiving pre-service training, should the curriculum use specific delivery modalities versus not?"" (81) - identified five eligible studies (one quantitative, four qualitative). Two studies were located in South Africa, two in the United States, and one in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The quantitative study was an RCT comparing the benefits of training CHWs in person or through web-based methods with a training approach based on mailing training materials to CHWs, finding no differences in outcomes (82)."

Growth is driven by demand for quality education among the emerging middle-income segment. Privately-funded primary and secondary schools are generally perceived by parents as worthwhile investments for their children, and those who can afford to do so will typically send their children into private education. Most private schools are based in cities. However, there are also a number of good public schools that provide higher-than-average standards of education, and place greater emphasis on English language education. These are popular among low-and middle-income families. These schools are also mainly located in urban areas, where there are more qualified teachers and greater resources. Both public and private schools are making every effort to improve the quality of their English tuition. Private schools believe that using English as a medium for teaching will help them to stand out from other schools. A comparison of interviews with public and private institutions reveals that private education places greater emphasis on English language education and commits more resources to it than public education. Education with English as a teaching medium in public high schools is of lower quality, as teachers in these schools generally speak less fluent English than their counterparts in private schools.

These barriers impede potential U.S. investment in Nigeria. Investors also must contend with complex tax procedures, confusing land ownership laws, arbitrary application of regulations, and crime. Companies report that contracts are often violated and that Nigeria's system for settling commercial disputes is weak and often biased. Frequent power outages, as well as poor road, port, rail, and aviation transportation infrastructure pose a major challenge to doing business in Nigeria. These factors hinder Nigeria's ability to compete in regional and international markets. The Nigerian government's efforts to reduce the amount of time, forms, and cost required to establish and operate a business contributed to the country's 24-place rise in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index in 2017, to 145 of 190 countries. However, the lack of further progress on reforms led to a one-place fall in 2018, to 146 of 190 countries. Foreign exchange restrictions have negatively impacted investment as well as trade. The measures have hampered some U.S. companies' abilities to import finished or semi-finished goods for use in their Nigerian operations. Similarly, the Central Bank of Nigeria has often restricted the repatriation of earnings, causing some businesses to close down or reduce services in Nigeria. These factors have also been a disincentive for new investment, as investors wait for an expected further devaluation of the Nigerian naira. While 100 percent foreign ownership of firms is generally permitted, investments in the oil and gas sector are limited to joint ventures or production-sharing agreements with domestic firms. Additionally, foreign investors must register with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission.

Private equity financing includes a broad range of external financing instruments, whereby the enterprise obtains funds from private sources in exchange for an ownership stake of the firm. The capital is provided to private companies, i.e. companies whose shares are not freely tradable in any public stock market, across the entire life cycle, from seed financing to buyouts (OECD, 2009). 333. Through private equity, wealthy individuals, investment funds or institutions participate fully in the entrepreneurial risk of the business, as capital is made available without provision of security. Compared to other forms of external finance, the investor accepts more risk and expects a higher return, typically above 25% IRR (internal rate of return) (see Table 6). 334. The investment is open-ended, though equity investors generally provide capital over a mediumto long-term horizon (3-10 years). The objective of investors is to make profit by ""exiting"" (i.e. selling their shares through an IPO, a trade sale or buyback by the other shareholders) once the firm has increased its share value. 335. Private equity investments are less volatile than those in the stock market. Trading does not have an impact on the asset class, as assets are held until maturity and valued on the basis of corporate fundamentals rather than depending on market fluctuations. The lower sensitivity to market variations provides investors a form of protection against equity market downturn and enables them to have stable and attractive returns. For instance, in Europe, since 2001, returns in the private equity segment have outperformed those in public equity markets by 9.4%. The 2008-09 financial crisis further widened the gap return between these markets (Idinvest, 2014). 336. Private equity is divided into two distinct components, namely venture capital, targeted at new and early stage companies, and other private equity, such as growth capital and buyouts, targeted at mature businesses (see Table 6)39.

Most people feel strongly that their jobs should be meaningful and contribute to society. A 2005 survey of 29 countries asked people about the characteristics that they valued in their jobs.43 Over threequarters reported that it is important to have a job that is useful to society, and a similar share agreed that it is important that their jobs help other people.

For example, women humanitarian leaders in both countries identified care work as a hurdle affecting their ability to participate in humanitarian action, because women leaders find themselves--often unlike their male counterparts--having to juggle both work and family responsibilities. In Bangladesh, a Rohingya woman leader spoke about the challenge of finding time to spend on work and with colleagues owing to the competing demands of the household.

The dual burden women leaders face needs more consideration and acknowledgment. 7 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan Disconnect from the humanitarian system Women's organizations generally struggle to be integrated into the mainstream humanitarian coordination system, making it a challenge for them to gain national-level recognition as significant humanitarian actors. If women and women's organizations are not considered humanitarian actors, they may be excluded from capacity-building and funding opportunities available as part of LHL programming, let alone from greater leadership roles. Yet this does not mean that women's organizations are not involved in humanitarian action; many provide humanitarian relief as part of their portfolios, and others do so when emergencies strike in their communities. In fact, although they are the exception, several women's organizations identified in the research are members of the United Nations-led cluster system in their respective countries, such as the Agrajattra Organization in Bangladesh, a women-led organization, which is a member of the child protection sub-cluster and the food security and shelter clusters, and the South Sudan Women's Empowerment Network, which is in the gender-based violence and child protection sub-clusters."

Most returned to their countries of origin because of the 2012 crisis, funded by donor States. However, the return and reintegration support that was available was often lacking. The returnees who had previously found success working in urban areas in the Central African Republic were frustrated to find themselves in rural surroundings upon return. When assistance to returnees dried up due to donor interests shifting to the insurgency in the Lake Chad region and resulting displacement, Chad was unable to continue to support returnees, and the reintegration support effectively ended.36 Thailand: Migrants' involvement in emergency management as a driver of integration Although migrants caught by the floods in Thailand were a particularly vulnerable group, they also were active members of their communities, providing relief and clean up services where needed and supporting preparedness, response and recovery efforts. This, in turn, made them feel more integrated in their host community. As one male migrant commented: ""Do you know, I even helped the soldiers and Thai citizens make dams against the flood? I lived like a Thai citizen and felt like I had a responsibility to support neighbours to prevent the flood."" Local Thai CSOs reported the involvement of migrants in supporting the communities they lived in, including support for host community members: ""In Samut Sakhon, some groups of migrant workers tried to form support networks and mobilized monks to collect alms as a fund for relief supplies. These were mostly Burmese, but they did it to support all flood victims, not just their compatriots."" Source: The above is an abridged extract of the Thailand Case Study (Bravi et al., 2017)."

This is because a migrant's legal status in a country can determine, for example, the extent to which they can access safe working conditions as well as the quality and affordability of health care. As illustrated in figure 1, there are multiple determinants of health - both individual and structural - that can have both positive and negative effects on health. An irregular migrant, for example, is unlikely to find work in the formal sector, and has to rely on the precarious informal sector, where work can be both unsafe and - often - illegal. As a result, irregular migrants may experience greater vulnerabilities to poor health, including increased exposure to infectious diseases, violence and injury. They are likely to face many challenges in accessing quality health-care services, and have very limited (if any) access to social protection services.

Results of evaluations of Better Factories Cambodia, covering more than 90 percent of participating factories, found that compliance on occupational safety and health improved 20 percent. Correct payment of wages, overtime, and benefits increased 37 percent. Initially, incentives to improve working conditions were driven by the quota increases called for under the trade agreement; however, with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), quota increases were no longer possible. Nevertheless, the Cambodian garment industry has continued to invest in monitoring, having identified labor compliance as an important part of its claim to a niche in the global garment industry. This niche exists despite the expiration of the MFA largely because of the role that reputation plays in the supply chain. 308 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 proposals in the Doha agenda and in regional trade discussions offer prospects for significant liberalization (figure 9.7). 102 However, the productivity gains from services liberalization would be substantial.

Girls may face greater expectations of caregiving at home, such that prolonged closures are likely to exacerbate inequalities, and a lot of girls will find it difficult to balance schoolwork and their increased domestic responsibilities (UN Women, 2020). Studies have shown that in cases where schools remained closed for a significant period of time (such as a full academic year), as happened in Sierra Leone, girls and young women found it harder to re-enrol even after schools reopened, with enrolment rates falling close to 16% in the most disrupted villages (Rohwerder, 2020).

The NGO found that the killings were more brutal than in previous years and tended to be committed by perpetrators acting in groups. In June 2017, the National Assembly approved an amendment to the Comprehensive Law on Violence against Women; the amendment reduced the scope of the definition of femicide to the private sphere, limiting the crime to relations between spouses and partners. Critics said the new definition denied the reality of femicides, which were also committed in public places. Abortion remained banned in all circumstances.

Basically such features are that: 1. They are based upon the collective rights of the respective indigenous people, nation or community to lands, territories and resources, under national contexts; 2. They are established as protected areas in application of the right of self-determination, exercised mainly through: * Self-declaration of the protected area by the indigenous people or nation with collective territorial rights on the area; * Free, prior and informed consent of the people, nation or community with territorial rights on the area, in cases where the designation proposal is originated in government agencies, conservation organizations or other actors. 3. They are based on ancestral or traditional occupation; 4. Occupation, use and management are connected to and dependent upon the broader socio-cultural and political structure of a people or nation, which includes their customary law and institutions; 5. They are self-governed by indigenous institutions within their territories and the protected areas contained therein, in application of arrangements established with system-level protected area authorities. 3.

Gay men faced violence, bullying and verbal abuse during compulsory military service. A serving soldier was convicted of same-sex sexual activity. Although pervasive discrimination based on real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity continued in Japan, there was some progress in local municipalities. For the first time in the city of Osaka, the authorities approved a same-sex couple as foster parents, and two other municipalities took positive steps towards recognizing same-sex partnerships. A landmark ruling by its highest court saw Taiwan close to becoming the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage, in a major step forward for LGBTI rights. The judges ruled the country's marriage law unconstitutional as it discriminated against same-sex couples, and gave lawmakers two years to amend or enact relevant laws.

cffebd88-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor169.txt	From the supply side, labor is generally found to be more productive outside agriculture than in it. According to the national accounts, the value added per laborer outside agriculture is, in developing countries, on average 4.5 times the value added per laborer in agriculture. In middle-income countries, the ratio is 3.4, and in high-income countries, 2.2.16 Within African countries, nonagricultural labor is 6 times more productive. These large productivity gaps at the initial stages of development and the subsequent convergence process suggest that there is a lot to be gained from moving people out of agriculture. It has also given rise to a popular view that the sectoral movement of people out of agriculture is a causal driver --rather than a manifestation --of development. In this view, the marginal productivity of labor in agriculture is virtually zero, such that labor can be removed from agriculture without (much) loss of output. 14 For an up-to-date general discussion, the reader is referred to Honorati, Gentilini, and Yemtsov (2015). 15 In technical terms, the income elasticity of the demand for non-food is larger than for food. 16 Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014).

Growth is driven by demand for quality education among the emerging middle-income segment. Privately-funded primary and secondary schools are generally perceived by parents as worthwhile investments for their children, and those who can afford to do so will typically send their children into private education. Most private schools are based in cities. However, there are also a number of good public schools that provide higher-than-average standards of education, and place greater emphasis on English language education. These are popular among low-and middle-income families. These schools are also mainly located in urban areas, where there are more qualified teachers and greater resources. Both public and private schools are making every effort to improve the quality of their English tuition. Private schools believe that using English as a medium for teaching will help them to stand out from other schools. A comparison of interviews with public and private institutions reveals that private education places greater emphasis on English language education and commits more resources to it than public education. Education with English as a teaching medium in public high schools is of lower quality, as teachers in these schools generally speak less fluent English than their counterparts in private schools.

Expanding the geographic coverage of IMR publications is a clear goal, as is attention to newer themes like forced and climate-related migrations, the impact of new media in migrant experiences, and the incorporation of data science into migration studies. As much as the detailed and thorough empirical research that sits at IMR's heart remains a high priority, we also hope to see more agenda-setting pieces like Tomas Jimenez and his co-authors' recent discussion (2018) of the ""next chapter"" in the study of assimilation.

Sharing information internationally in order to prevent new invasions is possibly the single most important area for improved international scientific cooperation. The mechanisms for increasing this cooperation are many and diverse. Several bodies are attempting (or have attempted) to create massive regional or global IAS databases (see list in Wittenberg & Cock, 2001). If properly maintained and networked, such databases would enable rapid access to information that could inform a wide range of stakeholders. Another popular approach is to create international networks of experts and then to use Internet appeals to solicit information on particular species.

They 186 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 were subjected to smear campaigns by both state and non-state actors to discredit their work, and were regularly targeted with intimidation, threats, and attacks. In June, three members of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) were attacked by armed assailants while they were in a car, returning from a meeting. Local NGOs said that the justice system continued to be misused to harass and discourage human rights defenders. Unnecessary and excessive use of force by security forces during peaceful protests wasalso reported. The vast majority of attacks registered against human rights defenders remained unpunished, as a result of multiple obstacles hindering investigations and trials. There was little progress in the investigation into the killing in March 2016 of Berta Caceres, the Indigenous environmental defender and cofounder of COPINH. The public hearings of eight suspects detained in relation to the case were postponed on multiple occasions. Independent experts revealed a lack of due diligence in the investigations, including a lack of prosecution of other individuals potentially involved in the crime. There was no information about any progress made by the Public Prosecutor in identifying those responsible for planningher killing. Although some progress was made to protect human rights defenders through the National Mechanism to Protect Human Rights Defenders, Journalists, Social Commentators and Justice Officials, efforts to ensure their comprehensive protection remained insufficient. New provisions of the Criminal Code on terrorism and related criminal offences approved by Congress in February and September were defined in an overly broad and vague manner, contrary to the principle of legality. The provisions could lead to the arbitrary and inadequate application of the Code against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders, which couldfurther criminalize their work and obstruct social movements.

These mechanisms included the use of military justice, arrests without a warrant, and the use of ambiguous and discretionary criminal definitions, among others, that demonstrated a much broader pattern of efforts to silence dissent.1 At the end of the year, 12 of these people were granted alternative measures to detention; the other 10 remained arbitrarily detained, although the courts had ordered the release of many of them. These documented cases included those of MP Gilber Caro and activist Steyci Escalona, both members of the opposition party Popular Will, who were arbitrarily detained in January after senior government authorities publicly accused them of carrying out ""terrorist activities"". Despite Gilber Caro's trial requiring authorization by Parliament, he remained arbitrarily detained and his case was submitted to military courts. Steyci Escalona was granted conditional release from pre-trial detention in November. By the end of the year, neither had been brought to trial. Hundreds of people reported that they were arbitrarily detained during the protests that took place between April and July. Many were denied access to medical care or a lawyer of their choice and in many cases were subjected to military tribunals.

Results show that the number of UNESCO cultural and natural sites, as well as intangible cultural heritage listings, keeps growing, indicating greater commitment to preserving some of the key attractions driving people to visit destinations. Encouragingly, Environmental Sustainability (pillar 9) scores have been boosted by the increase in environmental treaty ratifications and improved perceptions that T&T is being developed in a sustainable manner, all of which bodes well for natural resources and nature-based tourism. While this is promising, the enforcement of treaties and protected lands might not be enough to preserve natural resources, given that air pollution, deforestation and species endangerment have continued to rise over the last two years. Since the last edition of the report, the global average score for perceptions of the stringency and enforcement of environmental regulations improved by just 0.4%. Sadly, these perceptions declined the most in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that already struggles to better utilize its natural assets.

(2016a) who argue that a conceptual model of hazard response and recovery is too simplistic in poor rural areas because it does not fully capture that rural households live in a constant state of recovery and coping. Vulnerability analyses draw attention to the fact that households face multiple interacting stressors and their response capacity is constrained by this (O'Brien and Leichenko 2000, Eriksen and Silva 2009). Yet this understanding is not fully integrated into our implementation of disaster risk reduction or resilience building. Conceptual models of resilience need to reflect the interaction between climate hazards, the cyclical nature of low-productivity rice cropping, and the constant state of coping. Simply put, interventions that seek to make rice cropping less sensitive to climate hazards may not build resilience if they do not recognize the broader multistress, low-productivity state of rice farming. In parallel, development-focused interventions seeking to redress the subsistence level of rice-based livelihoods need to take into account how climate hazards amplify an already challenging environment. The need to integrate climate adaptation into disaster risk reduction and international development practice to improve resilience has long been articulated (Boyd et al. 2008). Yet our findings from the Mahanadi show that practical means of delivering this change are not yet evident.

As indicated in Figures 3.4 and 3.9, following a long period of stagnation, national statistics have recorded a very rapid gain in rice production in Coted'Ivoire since 2009. These gains are largely achieved through gains in yields. But many challenges and opportunities for production, yield and jobs growth remain through interventions on the farm, but also down the chain. Poor organization of marketing and processing of paddy rice was for example recognized by the NRDS as one of the key challenges to boost production, thereby for thefirst time explicitly linking the challenge of increasing yields with the challenge of improving performance along the whole chain. It identified (a) the lack of confirmed and regular buyers, (b) the high costs of collection and transport (undermining import competitiveness), (c) the non-remunerative prices for producers, the absence of a price guarantee mechanism, and the failure of buyers to observe contract terms, (d) an inefficient paddy-processing sector, and (e) lack of storage facilities as important constraints to boost import competitiveness and domestic production.

However, the government of Australia sought stakeholder views on whether to extend mandatory content funding mechanisms, which are currently applicable to traditional distribution platforms, to online digital platforms.

We are able to take opportunities and things we learn in one country and apply them elsewhere. So we're always learning and one of the great parts about our job is we're connecting people throughout the world and bringing ideas from one place to the other, whether or not they directly impact our product. We're a facilitator and our customers see that. And I think it's a very strong point when they get to know us is that we're connected throughout the world and bringing solutions from one corner to the next."" One concrete example is making our products easier to use. Stock said: ""In Southeast Asia, we were struggling with language barriers. We've been very ingrained in Latin America, very comfortable working with bilingual Spanish products and clients. But as we enter the Southeast Asian market we encounter the diversity of languages. Also because we're in agriculture, one of the end-users of our products may have limited education or ability to read--so our products can be technical in nature, and how do we overcome these hurdles? And so we've begun developing and incorporating visual aids, videos, icons, logos, things that will help them understand how to use the product, what it's designated for. And we're able to take that and apply it elsewhere, because it is a universal need, but it's being driven by a specific market area force at the moment."" Perhaps the biggest lesson is that exporting is a ""no-brainer."" Stock said: ""You should be exporting. If you're not, start learning about it, talk to other exporters and just go for it. I think the key things to exporting are persistence and patience. You have to realize that when you get in this, it may not be immediate sales, it may take years, but you have to have the long-term vision. If you're willing to go through a couple of ups and downs, it can pay offin dividends. If you don't enter the export market, you're limiting your sales in a big way, no doubt about it.""

With his colleagues at Bletchley Park, the government's top-secret codebreaking center, Turing developed the code-breaking Bombe machine and made other advances in decryption, which, building on work from Polish mathematicians, led to cracking the German Enigma code. His team's work is widely credited with expediting the war's end, saving millions of lives. But it is Turing's influence as a profound and inventive thinker of the modern digital age that the new pound50 is celebrating, according to John. ""If you think about where that idea has taken us between 1936 and today,"" said John, referring to Turing's groundbreaking paper that year, which proposed a computing machine, ""and how much computers influence our daily lives--we use them at work, at home, in hospitals, most of us have got a small computer in our pockets that we use on a day-to-day basis--that legacy of starting the computer revolution is really what we're trying to celebrate on this banknote."" Turing was selected for the pound50 after a monthslong ""Think Science"" campaign by the Bank of England, which elicited nearly a quarter-million nominations from the public, later whittled down by a committee of scientists and central bank officials. The short list included chemist Rosalind Franklin, instrumental in discovering the structure of DNA; theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking; and Srinivasa Ramanujan, who transformed modern mathematics."

""That was a really tough time to start a company, because this little recession happened about 5 months later,"" he recalled. Money was very tight and great care had to be taken when deciding where to spend on marketing and other business development strategies. From the beginning, the largest market for the product was outside the United States. How would Oliversmith find reliable buyers without spending a fortune on travel and advertising? The Solution Oliversmith made the first investment in a flight to a conference at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, co-sponsored by the U.S. Commercial Service. At the conference, which takes place annually in the spring, he met senior U.S. Commercial Service officers from all over Asia, a region where he'd never been. He said: ""With their help, I started to narrow down where we were going to first jump into the market, where we would start to spend our real resources. It was an amazing 3 days. I learned more in that conference than I could have learned in 2 years flying around on airplanes. Since then we now invest in those countries and are up and operational in many of them."" Officers he met at the conference helped him find partners in Asian countries with high growth potential. ""Before we knew it, we were in a wonderful university they found for us in Myanmar With the largest library of English language lessons available for mobile, we reach up to 85% of the world's English learning population. 29Success Story: Urban Planet Mobile (formerly Burma), and less than 9 months later we launched our product there.""

""The Chinese don't have the imagination piece. This may be a cultural thing that's very hard to change. We have that in this country. Some countries are good at copying things. They are content takers, not makers. As a result, the takers are hiring Americans to do the imagination part because we are content makers. Just look at Apple.

He believes that part of imagination is sustainability and that it should be considered in everything the company does. He says sustainability generates imagination when you are forced to look at the whole process, the whole life cycle, as Infinity does with everything it repairs and sells. ""It's not easy and takes time. We start by telling people that they are unconscious and unskilled, and that at the end of the process they will be conscious and skilled.

A Ugandan man, age 46, says, ""People who are empowered 'see change in their lives.'"" Naturally, context and culture also shape one's definition of empowerment. In Uganda, women interviewed in the qualitative case studies related empowerment as the ability to improve quality of life, whether fiscally or in relation to autonomy, or as decision-making capacity and tended to define empowerment as ""someone who is independent."" Women in Guatemala generally defined empowerment as ""decision-making capability"" and ""equality"" with men. For example, a 63-year-old woman said, ""Being empowered, it means that the woman can do things too, not just the man."" Women in Bangladesh tended to view empowerment more narrowly, related to their financial position, as directly resulting from ""having money"" and assets as well as cooperatively ""succeeding"" at work. In Bangladesh, individuals cited a communal, rather than a singular, understanding of empowerment focused on the family unit rather than the individual woman or man--which includes the ability to work jointly and well together.

D Silva (1994) has observed that private supplementary tutoring can enable teaching to be undertaken according to individual needs. His observation is ""Sometimes large gaps in students' learning are created due to a number of factors such as student and teacher absence, frequent closure of school, ineffective teaching and negligence on the part of the teacher. Effective private tuition may help overcome these gaps or deficiencies in students' learning and build their confidence enabling them to compete with others and experience a happy and peaceful life."" (as cited in Bray, 1999, p.51) Vogel (1993) studied the effect of private tutoring on College students. After these students graduated, Vogel found that the longer duration of private tutoring, the better outcomes. (as cited in Khuwaileh and Al- Shoumali, 2001, p.32). Greaney and Kellaghan (1995) investigated private tutoring in English and its effect on language tests, again establishing a positive effect. (as cited in Khuwaileh and Al- Shoumali, 2001, p.32). Sometimes, private tutoring is reported to have a negative effect on mainstream classes.

Those that exploit workers, expose them to dangerous environments, or threaten their physical and mental well-being are bad for individuals and societies. Their negative effects can be surprisingly long-lasting. An extreme example is the impact of the Atlantic slave trade on West Africa. A study found that individuals whose ancestors had been threatened by slavery were less likely to trust relatives, neighbors, and local governments even more than 100 years after the end of the slave trade.2 Today, international norms of human rights and labor standards reject forced labor, harmful forms of child labor, discrimination, and the suppression of voice among workers. Yet close to 21 million people globally are estimated to be victims of bonded labor, slavery, forced prostitution, and other forms of involuntary work.3 In 2008, 115 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 were involved in hazardous work (box 5.1).4 cohesion. Data from household, plant-level, and values surveys, as well as qualitative assessments, can be used to determine the existence of relevant spillovers. Although quantifying all the gaps between the individual and social values of jobs may not be possible, identifying where these gaps lie can help make policy trade offs transparent. The analytical tools to do so can be borrowed from several disciplines in economics and the social sciences. These disciplines often focus on spillovers from jobs, without necessarily calling them that. While some jobs may contribute more to development than their individual values suggest, some forms of work are likely bad from any point of view. All countries have subscribed to a set of universal rights. Most governments, as well as international organizations and others, have ratified or endorsed standards seeking to eliminate forced labor, harmful forms of child labor, discrimination, and the suppression of voice among workers. Thus, some work activities are widely viewed as unacceptable and should not be treated as jobs.

The 2000 floods in Mozambique demonstrated clearly that it is possible to make an impact and carry out extensive recovery activities when the disaster is high profile and the amount of money donated to the affected populations is large. Recovery programs provided an opportunity for investments in upgraded services and infrastructure. Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted, albeit somewhat passively, to resume their livelihoods. On the negative side, asset depletion has been neglected in the post-emergency period. Increased social capital was the most important positive aspect for affected populations. There are indications that some of the new social structures created - associations, community committees and resettlement areas - will strengthen the safety net for future disasters, but it is too early to state categorically that this will be a lasting effect of the post-emergency interventions. Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important, long-term achievement of the recovery interventions. The importance of infrastructure construction and rehabilitation should not be underestimated when preparing contingency plans and developing a set of interventions to be considered post-emergency. In terms of Mozambique's development of its disaster preparedness and mitigation plan, much will depend on the level of commitment given to it by the government and by donors. The importance of this area is shown when a devastating disaster (of the kind experienced in 2000) occurs, but institutional memories can be short and other priorities may dominate, particularly in economic and political areas. It is also a question of whether disaster management issues can be maintained as priorities when government budgets are likely to be under increasing pressure. xiii .

In industrial countries and in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, life satisfaction is, on average, similar among both groups, but in Latin America, it is substantially lower among the self-employed.42 Jobs contribute to how people view themselves and relate to others. Most people feel strongly that their jobs should be meaningful and contribute to society. A 2005 survey of 29 countries asked people about the characteristics that they valued in their jobs.43 Over threequarters reported that it is important to have a job that is useful to society, and a similar share agreed that it is important that their jobs help other people. In nine countries, the share who reported that it is important for jobs to be socially useful was higher than the share reporting that high income is important. While most of these are high-income countries, preferences for The lack of employment can lower the selfesteem and undermine the social status of other family members.35 When jobs are in short supply and unemployment becomes a problem, people change their expectations and attitudes. Data from the World Value Surveys for a large set of countries (both developed and developing) show that higher unemployment rates are associated with lower ambitions to do meaningful work, perhaps indicating that a lack of available jobs impels individuals to accept any job.

Each edition of the series now has two parts comprising: * Part I: Key information on migration and migrants (including migration-related statistics); * Part II: Balanced, evidence-based analysis of complex and emerging migration issues. 11WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 World Migration Report 2000 World Migration Report 2003: Managing Migration - Challenges and Responses for People on the Move World Migration Report 2005: Costs and Benefits of International Migration World Migration Report 2008: Managing Labour Mobility in the Evolving Global Economy World Migration Report 2010: The Future of Migration: Building Capacities for Change World Migration Report 2011: Communicating Effectively about Migration World Migration Report 2013: Migrant Well-Being and Development World Migration Report 2015: Migrants and Cities: New Partnerships to Manage Mobility World Migration Report 2018 World Migration Report 2020 The move away from single theme editions of the report series to this two-part structure was in recognition of the significant changes in migration research, analysis and publishing, as well as the different expectations and needs of readers. For those who want to find out about key migration facts and figures, Part I brings together the latest information and statistics so that readers are able to better understand migration trends, changing patterns and processes at the global and regional levels. But for those who may be working on (or studying) specific areas of migration policy or practice, deeper dives into the complexities are offered in Part II. Refinement of the series was also in recognition that, as the focus on, and complexity of, migration intensifies, reports limited to a single theme have the potential to understate or miss entirely the broader changes that are occurring in migration transformations globally.

Note (a): For example, Birkhaeuser, Evenson, and Feder (1991) found no significant relationship between the provision of traditional extension services and farm productivity in Africa, whereas Evenson (2001) and Dercon et al. (2009) identified some successes. Anderson and Feder (2003) propose an organizational inquiry into which model of extension (public or private) can deliver superior results. With nonagricultural self-employment and work in household enterprises emerging as one of the key contributors to the generation of new jobs, it is important to consider the government's role in equipping the workforce with the right skills for this sector. Evidence is still emerging on which skills are most useful in the household enterprise sector as well as how to cost-effectively develop these skills through large-scale programs. For example, it is not clear whether technical or vocational skills can necessarily lead to employment in a skilled profession, nor whether business or behavioral skills are the most binding constraint to household entrepreneurs when many other constraints, such as access to credit or freedom to operate, are known to exist. And even once a clearer understanding is developed on which skills are most important, it should also be recognized that training programs are not always effective or efficient at delivering these skills, even though programs may be well-funded and politically supported (Blattman and Ralston 2015). Finding a training program model that maintains high participation rates and delivers the skills that participants both want and need for their work has been notoriously difficult to implement in practice. Recent work, as described in Box 6.3, suggests that given these caveats it may be best to provide skill development programs through a more demand-focused and results-driven approach, whereby individuals can seek out an integrate range of skills that are most important to them and programs are funded based on meeting these needs.

These technical factors would be spurred on by the peanut CRSP. But just as important as the technical factors of production are several other considerations. There exists an unusual level of enthusiasm and willingness to participate on the part of the local farmers. There exists a high degree of trust between the project participants and the people of the Rupununi and a mutual, yet cautious expectation for success. The American Principal Investigators demonstrated a dedication to the project and this type of work and a genuine commitment not to be found among other projects. Finally, there was a high level of participation by women and they virtually dominated (in number) the workshops.

For example, the comparability of data on earnings is affected greatly by the data source used. Establishment surveys sometimes exclude workers in small enterprises and in the informal sector. Labour force surveys, although they cover all types of workers, have to rely on selfreported wages, which may introduce reporting errors. Comparability of data is also affected by the concepts and methods used to produce them, including how questions are phrased. For instance, the way in which women are interviewed about violence may affect their willingness The World's Women 2015xvi and capacity to disclose their experience, undermining the quality of the data produced and also their international comparability.

cffebde7-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor153.txt	Most ICCAs face formidable forces of change, which they might be better able to withstand with the help of an official recognition and appreciation, especially when the most likely alternative may be exploitation, e.g., for timber or tourism. In these cases recognition within national protected area systems, if ICCAs meet the protected area definition and standards or other types of formal recognition, can provide indigenous peoples and local communities with additional safeguards over their land. This should be coupled, however, with the acceptance by the state that ICCAs are inherently different from state-governed protected areas - in particular regarding their governing institutions. It should be noted however that formal recognition of ICCAs can bring new dangers, such as increased visitation and commercial attention to the site, or greater governmental interference. Indigenous peoples and local communities also worry that official recognition of ICCAs may get them co-opted into larger systems over which they have, basically, no control.

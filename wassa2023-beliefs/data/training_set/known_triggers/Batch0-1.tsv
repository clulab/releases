They have learnt to appreciate the knowledge that our technical team gives them and applied in their farms everything we've taught them.

cffec084-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor30.txt	There are two central points for intervention. And both make lives better. One of the greatest opportunities to increase human wellbeing is to slow down and eventually reverse population growth. This does not require coercive measures, in fact non-coercive ones are far more effective. And even more importantly, those investments make lives better, particularly for those who live in more fragile conditions today. Above all, this is the chance to invest in women, by giving them access to schooling, but also to family planning. This helps women to be more in control of their lives, and to contribute more effectively, for instance as community leaders or entrepreneurs. In many poorer parts of Africa, girls are excluded due to immediate economic hardship, and as a result poverty persists. When women attend school, they also have better chances of finding work and shaping their own lives. Their quality of life increases, as does that of their children and all other members of their family, men and women. Also, families become smaller. As a result there is more capacity for everyone living on limited resources. In the global economy it is beneficial for a country to have a gradually shrinking population. Many people think the opposite is true. They believe that competitiveness increases with a growing population. In an ecologically scarce world this no longer holds true.

In June, the High Authority of Communication suspended Espace FM radio presenter Mohamed Mara for one month on grounds that he had used ""insulting"" language during a radio debate on polygamy. In November, the Authority ordered that the radio station be taken off air for one week after the station discussed under-resourcing in the army which the authorities claimed could undermine national security and morale among the armed forces. In July, National Television suspended Alia Camara, one of their journalists, for criticizing the low pass rate in baccalaureate examinations. On 27 June, gendarmes arrested guineematin.com journalist Amadou Sadio Diallo in Lelouma for ""disturbing public order"" after he published what the authorities described as ""false news"" about a possible Amnesty International Report 2017/18 183 cholera outbreak.

The armed group Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility. Six people believed to be responsible were killed by security forces, and four others were arrested and prosecuted for being implicated in the attacks and as members of the group that carried out the attacks. On 1 October, the government of Catalonia, an autonomous region in the northeast, held a referendum on the region's independence, in defiance of several Constitutional Court rulings. On 17 October, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the regional law on which the referendum was based and confirmed its precautionary measure which it had adopted on 7 September, aimed at preventing the referendum. On 27 October, the pro-independence political groups in the Catalonian regional parliament unilaterally declared the independence of Catalonia. On the same day, the Senate authorized the Spanish government to adopt measures pursuant to Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, effectively suspending the region's autonomy. On 21 December, new regional elections in Catalonia took place. The party which obtained more votes than any other single party was a nonindependence party, but overall the elections delivered the majority in the regional parliament to the combined proindependence parties.

And I think it's a very strong point when they get to know us is that we're connected throughout the world and bringing solutions from one corner to the next."" One concrete example is making our products easier to use. Stock said: ""In Southeast Asia, we were struggling with language barriers. We've been very ingrained in Latin America, very comfortable working with bilingual Spanish products and clients. But as we enter the Southeast Asian market we encounter the diversity of languages. Also because we're in agriculture, one of the end-users of our products may have limited education or ability to read--so our products can be technical in nature, and how do we overcome these hurdles? And so we've begun developing and incorporating visual aids, videos, icons, logos, things that will help them understand how to use the product, what it's designated for. And we're able to take that and apply it elsewhere, because it is a universal need, but it's being driven by a specific market area force at the moment."" Perhaps the biggest lesson is that exporting is a ""no-brainer."" Stock said: ""You should be exporting. If you're not, start learning about it, talk to other exporters and just go for it. I think the key things to exporting are persistence and patience. You have to realize that when you get in this, it may not be immediate sales, it may take years, but you have to have the long-term vision.

Because various computer networks are accessed through English and most textbooks used in universities are published in English (Khuwaileh & Shoumali, 2001, p.31).

cffec090-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor155.txt	Species introductions are either deliberate (e.g. crops, ornamentals) or accidental. The latter has included contaminants in introduced germplasm and in ships ballast water. Prevention is the first line of defense against IAS and, all being equal, is the most cost-effective approach. However, although quarantine is now a common feature of many countries import systems, implementation is frequently hindered by factors such as inadequate institutional capabilities and existing infrastructures. Historically, prevention measures have been developed by the agriculture/forestry sector for economic pests and these methods have mostly relied on exclusion methods. There are three types of exclusion methods: interception, treatment, and prohibition. Interception relies on risk assessments and the effective implementation of national regulations at the borders of a country. Treatment has involved, for example, the application of chemicals such as methyl bromide (MB) for the fumigation of many agricultural and forest products. Due to concerns for environmental health, MB is being phased out in some cases (by 2005) so alternative fumigation procedures are being investigated, such as irradiation and hot water treatment. Additional measures for prevention, such as biological risk assessment and analysis, are also under development. These measures are aimed at predicting whether or not a species is likely to become established and invasive. In theory, risk analyses can be applied to entire pathways (e.g., shipping) for the movement of species. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) provides details for the analysis risks to cultivated plants (see International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 1127). However, recently, the IPPC has started to consider the analysis of risks of plant pests to the environment and biological diversity (plant related). Indeed, more generally, the challenge ahead is adaptation of appropriate prevention measures to cover environmental as well as agricultural concerns .

Building resilience of persons with disabilities and reducing their exposure to and impact from climate-related hazards and other shocks and disasters (targets 1.5 and 11.5 and Goal 13) Persons with disabilities are particularly vulnerable during natural disasters, in conflict, extreme climate events and humanitarian emergencies. Barriers to their full participation in society prior to disasters and other emergencies, including inaccessibility of the physical environment, tend to be exacerbated by natural disasters and conflicts. Failure to consult with persons with disabilities and their representative organizations in the development of plans to respond to emergency situations means that these obstacles will remain during emergencies.

Substantial changes in practice behaviour could first be observed when on-the-job coaching and continuous feedback was used to support practitioners. This broader literature may be of value when considering the development of practice guidelines for CHWs in this area (89, 90). The GDG considered that the evidence base from other health occupational groups - showing that a balance between theoretical and practical training is associated with positive outcomes - can be assumed to apply also to CHWs. Similar considerations apply to the evidence supporting a ""rural pipeline"" approach, with health education institutions established preferentially in rural areas and opportunities for practical training in rural areas (91). Efforts should also be made to ensure that digital health education approaches complement, rather that replace, traditional face-to-face instructional modalities (92). 7.4.5 Implementation considerations Countries will need to identify the appropriate balance in their context between theoretical and practical training, taking into account a variety of factors, including the pre-existing literacy and educational attainment of trainees. The use of dynamic teaching methodologies, as well as the use of multimedia resources, have the potential to make the training more attractive and effective. The role of simulated practice may be considered for skills development and in areas where exposure to practical training in communities or health facilities may present logistical or operational challenges."

However, the comprehensive and systemic vision underpinning Indicator 15 can also be applied to assess if the requirement is met in a more system-oriented manner. For this purpose, the GPE Secretariat has developed a tool that is built largely from the Indicator 15 definition and methodology. It considers issues of system quality in relation to both large-scale assessments and public examinations (as for Indicator 15), but it goes further by examining classroom assessment as well. A pilot is planned to assess the use of this tool for both evaluation of the funding model requirement and Indicator 15 data collection in the future. This could contribute to strengthening dialogue about learning assessment system at the country level. 22.

All countries are already under pressure from existing crises or vulnerable to future ones. Current compounding crises include infestations of desert locusts in both Kenya and Pakistan and unusually heavy rainfalls in Kenya in late April 2020, which caused extensive flooding and landslides. Likely future impacts include monsoon and rainy seasons in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sierra Leone, usually from June till September, and Indian Ocean cyclones peaking in May, October, and November. These other hazards will have compounding impacts that pose major challenges to planners and responders (see Box 2) and which require a highly adaptive approach. (c) Maintains 37 Box 2: Compounding impacts of COVID-19 and other crises Countries will have to deal with a range of other crises during the pandemic, particularly natural hazard such as flooding, desert locusts and cyclones. The compounding impacts of natural hazards and other crises can: * Increase hardship and need - for example, food security will be worse for populations suffering both locust infestations and lockdowns. * Increase infection rates - for example, flood water contaminated by human faeces can spread COVID-19. * Increase health service demand and diagnostic problems. Rainy seasons tend to increase numbers of patients with coughs and respiratory problems, which would normally be considered for bronchitis or pneumonia; now COVID-19 will also be a possibility, introducing both a diagnostic dilemma and infection control problem. * Reduce the ability of national services to prepare and respond, as the efforts of emergency planners and responders are focused on COVID-19. * Require new emergency protocols. There may be a contradiction between COVID-19 and emergency responses - for example, people would normally be evacuated and gather in cyclone shelters to avoid the worst of a storm, but this cannot be implemented as standard due to social distancing protocols. New approaches will be required, which balance the risk of COVID-19 with the risk of the hazard.

Cannabis plants, seeds and oil are frequently seized in the region and remain the most widely abused substances. Afghanistan continues to be considered one of the largest illicit producers of cannabis resin worldwide. While the trend of illicit cannabis cultivation and production is believed to be stable in that country, on the basis of the results of annual surveys conducted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime between 2009 and 2011, systematic data collection efforts have not been undertaken since. Further, there are continued reports of illicit cultivation of cannabis in the Bekaa valley of Lebanon, where eradication efforts have been sustained. 615. According to the data available to the Board, cannabis seizures increased in West Asia in 2014, with the exception of Israel, where quantities of both cannabis herb and cannabis resin seizures decreased from 2013 to 2014 (from 38 kilograms (kg) to 7 kg of cannabis herb and from 320 kg to 6 kg of cannabis resin). The countries reporting the largest seizures of cannabis in 2014 were, in descending order of seizure amount, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon. According to the data provided to the Board by the authorities of Saudi Arabia, seizures of cannabis herb in the country have nearly doubled: from 23 tons in 2011 to nearly 38 tons in 2014. 616. Large shipments of cannabis destined for Libya are regularly stopped in Lebanon, where almost 3 tons of cannabis herb were seized in 2014, a considerable increase compared with the 164 kg seized in 2013. Furthermore, in early 2015, Lebanese police had already seized a total of 2 tons of cannabis on the way to Libya.

Layout: This worksheet begins with one identifying column. The 'Name' column reports the names of the considered groups of products summarized in this worksheet: 'crop products,' 'cropland in livestock,' and 'unharvested cropland.' This identifying column is followed by four columns that report the Footprints of Production ('EFP'), Imports ('EFI'), Exports ('EFE'), and Consumption ('EFC') for each products' group. Data and Calculation: For the 'crop products' group, the 'EFP', 'EFI', and 'EFE' columns report values directly from the Level 3 worksheets, crop_efp, crop_efi, and crop_efe, respectively. For the 'cropland in livestock' group, two grazing land-related Level 3 worksheets, livestock_efi and livestock_efe, are used as value sources for the 'EFI', and 'EFE' columns. These worksheets are used to estimate the amount of cropland embodied in traded livestock. For the 'unharvested cropland' group, the 'EFP' column reports values to adjust for the land locally left fallow. Finally, for each group, the 'EFC' column is calculated using the Equation 2_1. The final row in the ef_crop table totals the Footprints of Production, Imports, Exports, and Consumption to obtain total Footprints for the crop land use type. The total Footprint of Production for the 'crop products' group is calculated by summing only the Footprint of Production of primary products to avoid double counting. The total Footprint of Consumption is calculated by applying Equation 2_1 to the total EFP, EFI, and EFE.

For example, it is important to distinguish between local and national actors, but there is some fuzziness in this regard, and this lack of clarity is arguably an issue in LHL in general. Local and national organizations can face distinct challenges and barriers to LHL: a large NGO that works all across the country can have a different experience from a local, more regionally focused entity. The fuzziness between local and national actors was more apparent in South Sudan, perhaps because the case study's research area was mainly in Juba, where there was little or no distinction between what was considered ""local"" and what was considered ""national."" 15 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan Another definitional challenge was distinguishing between a women's organization and a women-led organization. At the outset of this research, both country case studies understood women leaders to involve solely women-led organizations. While women-led organizations are key to this analysis, we also did not want to omit organizations with a strong gender focus or assume that just because an organization was led by a woman it had an interest in women's rights and gender justice. Through discussions between the case study authors and the Oxfam America researcher, we agreed to broaden the definition of women's organizations to beyond women-led organizations if the organizations in question were able to show that they had a strong gender justice program."

These parts are to be considered separately as follows: (1) Concerning the work undertaken at the University of Georgia, there is unquestionably a need in developing countries for low-cost robust methods of analysis for aflatoxins. There are Project UWI49F - 135 - requirements both to screen out highly contaminated peanuts to remove from the food chain and in some cases to screen for purposes of export. Existing commercial affinity column based semi-quantitative screening methods work extremely well but are very expensive due to the high prices of imported affinity columns. Using the VICAM system of clean-up on an affinity column then brominating and measuring fluorescence in a small fluorimeter, the aim has been to replace the affinity column with a low cost alumina-based column which can be made from locally available materials. Using acetone extraction, bromination and fluorescence measurement a limit of detection of 5 ppb for total aflatoxins has been achieved and 300-400 samples can be analyzed per day. The approach does need validation and it is recommended that this should be carried out with a major involvement of developing countries.

However, Mozambique's recovery from the 2000 floods broadly appears to have been effective and generally well handled. The 2000 floods in Mozambique demonstrated clearly that it is possible to make an impact and carry out extensive recovery activities when the disaster is high profile and the amount of money donated to the affected populations is large. Recovery programs provided an opportunity for investments in upgraded services and infrastructure. Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted, albeit somewhat passively, to resume their livelihoods. On the negative side, asset depletion has been neglected in the post-emergency period. Increased social capital was the most important positive aspect for affected populations. There are indications that some of the new social structures created - associations, community committees and resettlement areas - will strengthen the safety net for future disasters, but it is too early to state categorically that this will be a lasting effect of the post-emergency interventions. Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important, long-term achievement of the recovery interventions. The importance of infrastructure construction and rehabilitation should not be underestimated when preparing contingency plans and developing a set of interventions to be considered post-emergency. In terms of Mozambique's development of its disaster preparedness and mitigation plan, much will depend on the level of commitment given to it by the government and by donors. The importance of this area is shown when a devastating disaster (of the kind experienced in 2000) occurs, but institutional memories can be short and other priorities may dominate, particularly in economic and political areas. It is also a question of whether disaster management issues can be maintained as priorities when government budgets are likely to be under increasing pressure. xiii .

Instead, according to its approach, it tells how much biocapacity is created and how much is removed per year - is this a weak point of the method? It is true that many basic things upon which our economy depends are poorly documented - the biocapacity of forests, for example. There are no reliable time series, not even robust data about how productive they actually are. We have huge knowledge deficits. Although fishing grounds collapse, we have difficulty tracking this phenomenon in our accounts using the numbers we receive each year from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. The large data gaps is in my opinion a reflection of how severely we underestimate how essential these resources are for our economy. Our accounts can be improved significantly.

Some 1.65 billion have regular wages or salaries. Another 1.4 billion work in farming and small household enterprises, or in casual or seasonal day labor. The majority of workers in the poorest countries are engaged in these types of work, outside the scope of an employer-employee relationship. Another 200 million people, a disproportionate share of them youth, are unemployed and actively looking for work. Almost 2 billion working-age adults are neither working nor look ing for work; the majority of these are women, and an unknown number are eager to have a job.1 The jobs challenge facing the world is multifaceted, ranging from improving aspects of the work people do, to supporting the reallocation of people to better jobs, to creating jobs for those who want to work. Youth bulges in some countries are bringing in millions of new job seekers. Sub-Saharan Africa's labor force grows by about 8 million people every year. South Asia's grows by 1 million people every month. Elsewhere, the working population is rapidly aging, and more and more workers are putting off retirement.

From primary school age, students are exposed to the language and then continue, where possible, to improve their skills, all the way up to university. This sharpening of language skills allows access to better salary opportunities in what can be considered a disadvantaged country. The quality of the education system differs by location: in rural areas access to education is limited, although the government is actively looking to find a solution to this problem with increased spending. Currently 17% of government spending in Bangladesh is on education. Improving English skills is viewed as an important means of advancing both individual wealth and the economy of the country. The aim is to create a workforce that can service international companies' direct investment in Bangladesh, who typically use English as a lingua franca. English speakers in the business environment are expected to speak English to at least intermediate level. Furthermore, in some sectors, such as foreign trade and telecommunications, employees are expected to have a good level of English. On top of this, 24 of 30 companies interviewed by Euromonitor indicated that employees with a good command of English advance quicker than those who do not - ultimately resulting in higher salaries.

(See Chapter 10 for recommendations on specifying terms of law and arbitration.) It is vital to include an escape clause in the agreement that allows you to end the relationship safely and cleanly if the representative does not fulfill expectations. Some contracts specify that either party may terminate the agreement with written advance notice of 30, 60, or 90 days. The contract may also spell out exactly what constitutes ""just cause"" for ending the agreement (for example, failure to meet specified performance levels).

cffec0bd-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor22.txt	The systematic review of reviews found that decisions about catchment area population should be based on a variety of considerations: frequency of contact required; nature of the services provided; expected weekly time commitment from the CHW; and local geography (including proximity of households), weather and transport availability (16, 17, 124). One review found that for interventions consisting of home visits only, there was no consistent effect of the size of the catchment population on neonatal mortality. However, when the interventions involved community mobilization as well, the reduction in neonatal mortality was greater when the catchment population per CHW was smaller (66). Another related finding was that a high workload could lead to CHW demotivation (121). 7.10.4 Interpretation of the evidence and other considerations by the GDG The variability of the evidence points to widely differing practices in determining the target population size and workload of CHWs, resulting in some programmes already stretching CHW capacities to their limits, while in other settings an additional workload can be accommodated without compromising quality and, conversely, improving cost-effectiveness. This variability in baseline situations, as well as in roles, responsibilities and levels of effort of CHWs, prevents setting global benchmarks on workload or appropriate population targets. Rather, the evidence points to the need to identify realistic and context-specific benchmarks.

Whilst some graduates, for instance in engineering, are scarce and sought-after, graduates in finance, accounting and management struggle to find employment, and as a consequence look for work overseas.

This is fortunate, because without this input of energy, resources would be depleted, wastes would accumulate, and the planet would become an increasingly inhospitable place.

The authors posit that legal systems for movable collateral are usually weak--they limit the scope of the movable assets that can be used as collateral, lack centralized registries, and require court orders to enforce defaults. When the protection of creditors' rights for movable collateral improves, however, banks lend one-third more using the same level of collateral. The authors test which of the components (creation, monitoring, or enforcement) matter more and find that the monitoring and enforcement components are the most relevant, implying that the results are driven by the existence of collateral registries and the possibility of out-of-court enforcement, and not by the mere existence of laws. 35The effects of business regulation Better protection of creditors' rights benefits firms, as long as the protections improve the efficiency of credit markets and access to funding.

In February 2014, Vietnam reached an agreement with the United States on the terms and conditions necessary to resume trade in white offal products, pending registration of individual U.S. beef, pork, and poultry facilities used to produce white offal products for sale in Vietnam. Following a November 2014 audit that MARD conducted of the U.S. food safety inspection system for meat and poultry, MARD continued to assert that white offal was high risk. In December 2014, MARD informed the United States that it would stop approving new U.S. facilities to export certain types of white offal to Vietnam until it received a U.S. report on corrective measures based on Vietnam's recommendations from the audit. Since that time, the United States has provided extensive information to Vietnam demonstrating the safety of U.S. white offal. The United States has continued to raise white offal with Vietnam at the technical and political levels, including during TIFA meetings in 2017 and 2018. During Prime Minister Phuc's visit to Washington in May 2017, Vietnam orally agreed to receive applications from more U.S. establishments seeking approval to sell white offal in Vietnam. Vietnam also agreed to work closely with U.S. establishments to resolve any questions on pending white offal applications. However, Vietnam has yet to act on white offal applications from U.S. establishments according to the May 2017 understanding, or to rescind officially Vietnam's ban on imports of white offal from anywhere in the United States. Meanwhile, MARD subsequently agreed to a follow-up systems-audit to review a subset of U.S. establishments that have registered to sell white offal in Vietnam. Depending on the results of that audit, Vietnam would approve other pending and subsequent facilities through a document review.

Laws were amended in Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia to stop rapists escaping prosecution (or benefiting from reduced penalties) if they married their victim. However, legislation in many other countries retained such a loophole. Jordan also struck out a provision that allowed reduced sentences for men found guilty of killing a female relative in a ""fit of rage caused by an unlawful or dangerous act on the part of the victim"", but kept one that granted leniency for ""honour"" killings of female relatives found in an ""adulterous situation"". Tunisia's parliament adopted the Law on Eliminating Violence against Women, which brought in several guarantees for the protection of women and girls from gender-based violence, and its president repealed a decree prohibiting marriage between a Tunisian woman and a non-Muslim man. In Qatar, a draft law was approved to provide permanent residency rights for the children of Qatari women married to non-Qataris, but discrimination persisted, with women unable to pass on their nationality and citizenship to their children. In Saudi Arabia, a royal order was issued in September allowing women to drive from mid-2018, although there were questions about how it would be implemented in practice. In April, another royal order had instructed all government agencies that women should not be denied access to government services if they did not have a male guardian's consent, unless existing regulations required it. However, the order appeared to keep in place regulations that explicitly require a guardian's approval, such as for women to travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry. Despite the positive developments, entrenched discrimination against women in law and in practice, notably in matters of marriage and divorce, inheritance and child custody, remained in these and many other countries in the region. Women were inadequately protected against sexual and other gender-based violence, as well as forced and early marriage."

In South Sudan, women leaders reported often facing the sentiment ""How can I be led by a woman?"" in the course of their work, even from individuals from within their own organizations. Women humanitarian actors in both countries also reported facing harassment during their work, whether from religious authorities in Bangladesh or from men seeking sexual favors in return for funding in South Sudan. In Bangladesh, Rohingya women's groups found that they faced additional questions when trying to organize, whereas men's groups were subject to few or no questions.

Whether as individual leaders in their communities or as grassroots women's organizations, there are countless examples of women's organizations working on the frontlines to help their communities prepare for and respond to humanitarian emergencies. In a 2010 report Suranjana Gupta and Irene Leung found that ""women's organizations have shown extraordinary capacities to mobilize women survivors to improve distribution of aid, access to resources, water and shelter, and making local institutions accountable in relief and rehabilitation"" (p. 1). Yet they also found that this contribution goes unrecognized and that ""women's organizations are forced to negotiate afresh to ensure their active participation in relief and rehabilitation processes"" (Gupta and Leung 2010, 1). Therefore when analyzing women's leadership in the context of LHL--a term that started being more widely used around 2014--it is important to keep in mind that a dearth of examples of women's leadership related specifically to LHL does not reflect a lack of women's leadership in the context of humanitarian action in general."

Voting is one of the most direct forms of political participation for citizens to exercise their political rights. However, persons with disabilities have a lower participation rate in voting even in countries with a comprehensive disability act. The inaccessibility of polling stations has been an obstacle for persons with disabilities to exercise their right to vote. In 7 out of 13 capital cities in Asia and the Pacific, less than 50 per cent of polling stations were accessible8 and in 2008 in the United States, only one in four polling stations was completely accessible.779 Existing data from developing countries indicate that persons with disabilities are almost twice as likely to not have voted in the last election and more than 4 times as likely to have found voting in the last election problematic (Figure II.136). Typical obstacles reported by persons with disabilities in casting their ballots include difficulties in reading the ballot, waiting in line, finding and getting into the polling place, writing on the ballot and communicating with election officials.780 Many persons with disabilities face numerous obstacles in obtaining high-level decision-making roles, particularly due to negative attitudes. Among 19 countries, around 2010, persons with disabilities were less likely than persons without disabilities to hold a position as a legislator, a senior official or a manager in 16 of these countries (Figure II.137).

This income became the main contribution to the local economy, together with remittances sent by those ex-Misima Mines Limited employees who found work in large mines elsewhere.44 And even in mining areas, social impacts are more mixed than the positive effect on living standards suggests. The influx of money from mining enclaves has enabled men to pay high prices for brides and marry multiple wives on an unprecedented scale, which might have contributed to a decline in women's status. Around Porgera Mine, the abandonment of older wives and the increasing number of women taken from other tribal groups are considered factors in the increased incidence of domestic violence and tension with neighboring groups. In Lihir, when groups of landowners received compensation and royalty payments, no women were given authority to control the accounts.45 In addition, children normally help out in artisanal and small-scale mines. In Misima, because of clear restrictions and training by the Wau Small-Scale Mining Center, children are less involved in mining than before, but child labor remains a con- Artisanal mining can flourish in parallel with major investments and raise the living standards of local communities. In Papua New Guinea, the number of grassroots alluvial miners is two to three times greater than the number of people working in the formal extractive industries sector, even if contractors and temporary workers are counted among the latter. Some of the large extractive projects, such as Ok Tedi Mine, happen to be in poor areas. Thus, the artisanal mining taking place around them helps spread the wealth.

They visited pesticide shops, interviewed retailers and dealers, pesticide company representatives, and lead farmers, and discussed the situation with experts in the field. The survey was conducted in Dhaka, Khulna, and Jessore district. They found that:  Dealers and retailers strongly influence the supply chain of pesticides due to their involvement with selling fertilizers, seeds, feeds, and other agricultural inputs.  Farmers largely depend on the recommendations of those dealers and retailers for selecting pesticide brands and doses of pesticides.  The selection of pesticides also depends on the quality, availability, competitive price, effectiveness, good will of the company, and the cropping pattern of the specific agro-ecological zone.  The leading pesticide companies are: Syngenta, auto crop care, Bayer Crop Science, Padma Oil company Ltd., Setu Corporation Ltd., and McDonald BD Ltd.

However, crosscountry analysis of values surveys finds that job loss or lack of access to jobs is associated with lower levels of trust and civic engagement. This is not only a rich-country phenomenon, as is often suggested. Unemployment can cause depression, increase mistrust in others, and lead people to drop out of community life. Migrants without social ties may be excluded from job opportunities that would allow them to succeed in their new environments. In extreme cases, if people, particularly youth, lack jobs and hope for the future, they may turn to violent or criminal activity to compensate for the absence of self-esteem and sense of belonging that a job might otherwise provide.

Farming operations have been fully mechanized. Nearly all rice seedlings are transplanted using mechanical transplanters. Despite this mechanization, production costs are many times higher than in tropical Asia because of exorbitant land prices and the high opportunity cost of farm labor. Young people are not interested in rice cultivation, which today is carried out mainly by older people. Many Japanese consumers now want environment-friendly rice grown without heavy use of agrochemicals. Some farmers have started producing rice through organic farming to meet this demand.

One such assumption is the location of a standardized business--the subject of the Doing Business case study--in the largest business city of the economy. The reality is that business regulations and their enforcement may differ within a country, particularly in federal states and large economies. But gathering data for every relevant jurisdiction in each of the 190 economies covered by Doing Business is infeasible. Nevertheless, where policy makers are interested in generating data at the local level, beyond the largest business city, and learning from local good practices, Doing Business has complemented its global indicators with subnational studies (box 2.1).

Some observers perceive the judicial system to be susceptible to external influence from both inside and outside the government and on occasion to be biased against foreigners. Based on anecdotal evidence, government-related corruption in the construction sector in particular appears to be worsening. Turkey ranked 81 out of 180 countries in Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index. Turmoil within Turkish government institutions, in the wake of the July 2016 attempted coup and restructuring of the government following Turkey's adoption of a presidential system in July 2018, appears to have multiplied the opportunities for public corruption, especially in government tenders that make it more difficult for foreign firms to compete fairly.

A study from ActionAid is one of the few that explicitly highlights the role of unpaid care work done by women responders in humanitarian emergencies. ActionAid finds that unpaid care work places restrictions ""on women's ability to lead their communities in reducing disaster risks and building resilience"" (Bolton et al. 2017, 4). This unpaid care work causes women to be more time poor, limiting their ability to take on extracurricular activities outside of the home; worsens women's economic power in that they cannot perform paid work or pay expenses to travel to community meetings; and ""limits women's perceived social value and undermines their self-confidence"" (Bolton et al. 2017, 5)."

cffec0ef-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor169.txt	New actions are possible to address the multiple constraints to a more supportive business environment for nonagricultural self-employment. A three-step approach is suggested. First, at a policy level, it is essential to articulate a strategy to provide voice for micro-enterprise operators, as well as institutional coordination and accountability for public agencies dealing with the sector. Second, at a programmatic level, specific interventions can be undertaken to relax binding constraints for household operators facing market failures. Easing access to capital through effective mechanisms is clearly a top priority, followed by the facilitation of access to markets and suitable work location. With regard to skills, the direct scope for intervention might be more limited, although providing access to training on business skills and skills upgrading opportunities could be considered. This could include leveraging and incentivizing existing private training providers, such as those in the traditional apprenticeship system, which are quite common for youths. Overall, based on international evidence, integrated interventions that address several of these binding constraints hold most promise. Lastly, given the heterogeneity in the sector, social protection may still be the only option for those that may not be able to grow or become more productive. Encouraging formal job creation by expanding the number, size, and spatial distribution of formal firms Given the higher quality of jobs in the modern formal sector, expanding the size of the formal sector is key to more and better jobs.

This policy change was seen by many, including African leaders, as being focused on reducing the number of African immigrants in France. Instead, many choose to learn English so they can study or work in English-speaking countries such as the UK or the US, before potentially returning to Cameroon to work with strong English language skills or to send money home. ),T!

Expected earning potentials (43.2 percent) in the sector as well as the desire to be independent (being one's own boss) (37 percent) are key motives why individuals declare preferring self-employment. In particular, the expectation of higher earnings than in other activities is a key reason for women to prefer the sector (44.2 percent) as is the desire to be independent individuals in rural areas (45.9 percent) (Table 4.1). 76 Lederman et al. (2014) and Perry et al. (2007) provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the selection into the sector. 77 For more formal entrepreneurship, Lederman et al. (2014) indicate that entry mistakes may occur if potential entrepreneurs are overconfident. This may apply less to developing countries and small-scale self-employment activities. Still, in the case of Coted'Ivoire, the qualitative survey indicates that virtually all potential entrepreneurs say they are absolutely confident that they will succeed once they establish their enterprises. Their confidence is explained by their own assessment of their abilities, prior experiences in the sector they want to operate, and so on.

cffec0fe-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor5.txt	The government publishes tender notices in the local press and sometimes publishes tenders in international magazines and newspapers. On occasion, there is a charge for the bidding documents. Cote d'Ivoire has a generally decentralized government procurement system, with most ministries undertaking their own procurements. The Bureau National d'Etudes Techniques et de Developpement (BNETD), the government's technical and investment planning agency and think tank, sometimes serves as an executing agency in major projects to be financed by international institutions. The government created the Direction des Marches Publics, a centralized office of public bids in the Ministry of Finance, to help ensure compliance with international bidding practices. While the procurement process is open in theory, in practice it is often opaque. There are numerous examples of significant government contracts that were awarded through single-source procurement procedures rather than through public tenders. Some well-entrenched foreign companies, particularly French ones, often appear to have preferred position in securing bid awards as a result of longstanding relations with government officials. Though not formally required, foreign companies often find it essential to partner with a local company in submitting a bid. During negotiations on a tender, the government will often impose local content requirements on foreign companies. In other instances, the government may award sole source bids without a tender, citing as a justification the high technical capacity of a firm or a declared emergency. Many firms continue to point to corruption as an obstacle that affects procurement decisions. At times, the government has cancelled or changed the publicly known result of a tender without giving a clear reason. In one instance, the government entered into commercial discussions with a U.S. company, expressing interest in the product or service of the firm and encouraging it to develop presentations and a work product, only to suddenly declare that the government was no longer interested, after having obtained valuable commercial information from the firm. Cote d'Ivoire is neither a signatory to, nor an observer of, the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement.

In addition, the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (2014) addressed the importance of providing high-quality education and training and called for enhancing international cooperation and investment in education, including support for transitions from basic to secondary education and from school to work for persons with disabilities.184 Two frameworks focused on education for children with disabilities. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) enshrined the right to education (articles 28 and 29) and specifically addressed the education of children with disabilities (article 23).185 Moreover, article 23, paragraph 3 asked States Parties to encourage extended assistance that should be designed to ensure that children with disabilities have effective access to and receive education and training.185 The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education, which was adopted at the World Conference on Special Needs Education in 1994, outlined challenges faced by children with disabilities and called for equality of opportunity for children, youth and adults with disabilities in integrated settings.186 The framework also encouraged countries to adopt complementary legislative measures in other related fields such as health, social welfare and employment and urged better coordination at the national level for coherence and maximum results.

The Board's mission to Timor-Leste in February 2015 was the Board's first since the country became a State Member of the United Nations in 2002. Timor-Leste acceded to the 1988 Convention in 2014 but is not yet party to the 1961 Convention or the 1971 Convention. The objective of the mission was to obtain detailed information on the Government's policy, national legislation and practical experience in the area of drug control, and to discuss obstacles to the accession of Timor-Leste to the international drug control treaties. 189. Timor-Leste does not have a national drug control strategy in place and the country's main drug control legislation is only at the draft stage. Timor-Leste lacks an institutionalized mechanism to implement the provisions of the international drug control conventions, notably in the area of precursor control. Progress needs to be made in several areas of drug control, including ensuring availability of opioid medications; promoting rational use of opioids for palliative care and pain management; drug demand reduction, especially drug use prevention; raising awareness on precursor control; and training and capacity-building for law enforcement. 190. The Board recognizes the efforts of and the progress achieved by the Government of Timor-Leste in building a State with functioning institutions. The Board urges the Government of Timor-Leste to accede to the 1961 Convention and the 1971 Convention and implement their provisions. Furthermore, the Board encourages the Government of Timor-Leste to take steps to draw up a national strategy for drug control and proceed with setting up a dedicated national coordinating body as envisaged in the draft drug control law.

In ecology, resilience is the degree to which a system can adapt, learn, and self-organize (Walker et al. 2004). Resilience to disasters is the ability to manage change, by maintaining or transforming living standards in the face of shocks without compromising long-term prospects (DFID 2011). Recognizing the strength of resilience as a concept to guide understanding of system response to change and exogenous shocks, researchers and policy makers are utilizing the concept to address development challenges (Barrett and Constas 2014, Bene et al. 2016b). In this context, the concept of resilience has been adapted to be cognizant of issues such as marginality, power, and agency and associated social and institutional structures that the vulnerability literature has flagged as being important to explain differential susceptibility to harm (Bene et al. 2012, 2014, Tanner et al. 2015). Recent definitions of resilience, adopted herein, describe it as a capacity, possessed by a unit, e.g. household, community, or country, to maintain or improve standards of living while facing an uncertain risk landscape (Barrett and Constas 2014).

Because of a lack of money in the economy, petty trading has not been revived. The families are mainly surviving on food for work projects two years after the floods. Women continue to try to farm. And some are beginning to keep chickens again. Some of the women said they had started a new business of selling meat from game hunted by the men. Men are unable to find work or alternative income sources so they work on the roads in the food for work programs; they no longer have boats or cattle, as they were lost in the floods. Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro District: Nova Mambone (continued) The positive aspects of the recovery process are that they live in areas that are more secure and people are less vulnerable to future flooding. There has been considerable investment in the economic, commercial and social infrastructure, and the road building has bought greater access to previously isolated areas. Some very remote areas are now reachable by boat, and the ferry has linked two potential markets. The district now has electricity, considered to be an important development step. The improved housing has been very important, as people now have greater access to social infrastructure and water supplies. The attitude of people has changed and people are less aggressive, they are pleased with the new plots and want to maintain the new environment in which they live.

It's a case that international organizations are making to donor groups and nations. ""Never let a good crisis go to waste,"" writes former Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin in her 2014 book The Resilience Dividend. Rodin continues to advocate adaptation to climate change. ""Disasters help get people's attention,"" she says in an interview. ""Before this concept was fully developed, people didn't tend to rebuild resiliently. Everywhere, it's the poor and vulnerable who get hit the hardest, whether they live on an island or in a city."" In March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai blasted Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe with days of high winds and heavy rains, killing more than 1,300 people. A month later, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth hit some of the same areas and compounded the devastation, bringing total damages from the two storms to $4 billion. It was the first instance on record of such sequential disasters in a single season and left almost 3 million people without housing, electricity, or running water. More than 800,000 hectares of crops were wiped out. ""Malawi is one of the least developed countries in the world and also one of the countries hardest hit by climate change,"" says Pritha Mitra, the IMF's mission chief for Malawi. ""We are looking at adapting to climate change and whether it's actually an opportunity to not only boost growth, but also reduce inequality. In sub-Saharan African countries, the people who are most affected by climate change are the poorer households, so climate change is exacerbating already-large inequalities."" In the cyclones' aftermath, the African Development Bank approved a $100 million, fouryear grant program that would directly benefit 1 million people across the three countries. The project includes measures to improve agricultural productivity and resilience by upgrading irrigation systems and livestock practices. In addition, it envisions making infrastructure such as roads, electrical grids, water supplies, and sanitation systems more resistant to big storms. The program will also enhance early-warning systems and institutional and community capacity to respond to disasters."	Disasters help get people's attention, she says in an interview.

Are there any obligations to report anything more than suspicious transactions e.g. unusual transactions, cash transactions above a certain threshold, international wire transfers, other transactions etc.? A20. Yes. Under the PCMLTFA, all reporting entities are required to report to FINTRAC transactions for which they have reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions are related to money laundering or terrorist financing (this includes attempted suspicious transactions). In addition, all reporting entities must report the following transactions to FINTRAC, unless stated otherwise: a) large cash transactions - receipt of an amount of CAD10,000 (approx. USD7,100) or more in the course of a single transaction, or multiple transactions over a 24 hour time period by or on behalf of the same individual or entity; b) electronic funds transfers - international ingoing and outgoing EFTs valued at CAD10,000 (approx. USD7,100) or more in the course of a single transaction, or multiple transactions in a 24 hour time period by or on behalf of the same individual or entity. This requirement applies to financial entities, MSBs (Money Service Business) and casinos; c) terrorist property - a report must be submitted to FINTRAC if a reporting entity has property in its control or possession that is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist, a terrorist group, or listed person. Nil reports must also be filed by certain reporting entities on a monthly basis with their principal regulators such as OSFI or IIROC. The monthly reporting requirement is separate and distinct from the requirements to immediately disclose detailed information to law enforcement agencies such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service; and d) casino disbursements - a casino must file a report when it makes a disbursement valued at CAD10,000 (approx. USD7,100) or more in the course of a single transaction, or over the course of multiple transactions in a 24 hour time period by or on behalf of the same individual or entity.

The automated screening model was launched to provide attention to people that suspected to have coronavirus. Users of this service enter their contact information and symptoms, following an automated flow of questions. According to their responses, the system formulates a general diagnosis. This system allows for better patient monitoring and follow-up care and is available via SMS, online, through the city's official app, and by dialling the city's call center, Locatel. In addition to this service, more than 6,000 medical kits have been delivered to people whose cases have been confirmed as coronavirus, to help keep sick patients from leaving their homes. A website shows the availability of hospitals beds capable of treating COVID-19 cases patients in Mexico City and the metropolitan area. The forms for applying to the Unemployment Insurance Program are now available online to people who have lost work because of the health crisis.

In Egypt, where more than 100 members of the security forces were killed in attacks by armed groups, mostly in North Sinai, the National Security Agency continued to forcibly disappear and extrajudicially execute individuals suspected of political violence. The Ministry of the Interior claimed that more than 100 individuals were shot dead in exchanges of fire with security forces throughout the year. However, in many of these cases the people killed were already in state custody after having been forcibly disappeared. Torture and other ill-treatment remained routine in official places of detention and was systematic in detention centres run by the National Security Agency. Hundreds were sentenced, including to death, after grossly unfair mass trials. In Iraq, suspects prosecuted on terrorism-related charges were routinely denied the rights to adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence, to not incriminate themselves or confess guilt, and to question prosecution witnesses. Courts continued to admit into evidence ""confessions"" that were extracted under torture. Many of those convicted after these unfair and hasty trials were sentenced to death. Iraqi and Kurdish government forces and militias also carried out extrajudicial executions of men and boys suspected of being affiliated with IS. Complaints of torture in custody against defendants accused of national security-related offences were reported in countries including Bahrain, Israel and Kuwait. In general, the allegations were not investigated. Saudi Arabia introduced a new counter-terrorism law that Amnesty International Report 2017/18 61 allowed for the death penalty for some crimes. In Tunisia, the government continued to restrict freedom of movement through arbitrary and indefinite orders that confined hundreds to their governorate of residence, justifying this as a measure to prevent Tunisians from travelling to join armed groups."

However, implementation of isolation has been inadequate, and poor conditions in some isolation centres have made families unwilling to leave their relatives at the centres. Lack of isolation beds has prompted facilities to refuse admission of confirmed cases with no or mild symptoms. Medical guidelines provided for self-isolation were often not followed by households or impractical in crowded living conditions, leading to family members becoming infected.

Without it we could not think of thoughts expressible to others, nor could we engage in the activities that commonly take place in the society we build ourselves (Di Pietro, 1994). Language is very important in education. The high status of English within a global economy of languages has meant that English language education is increasingly being promoted in international development initiatives. A broad goal of English language programs is that of developing the communicative ability to convey and interpret a message via written or spoken modalities to another person. In our country, there is no doubt that we still have not established a standard of education in schools and colleges. There are too many problems in our country that have to be eradicated to embrace a comprehensive education system through which we can expect ourselves to be a richer nation. We must not forget that students today will become the key members of our country who would be responsible for the overall development of our country. If we do not have good teacher, there is no way we could expect to have a balanced society in future. And if there are not enough good teachers in English, then there would be imbalance that the urban area students will be good at English, but students in rural areas would always be deprived of getting or learning English properly. The main objectives of teaching English in Bangladesh are to enable students to understand simple commands, instructions and requests in English and also carry them out. (national curriculum and textbook boards 2006). Most of the students of rural schools are unable to attain the primary English language competencies due to prevailing challenges in our education system. The main objective of this research is to find out the challenges and problems and prospects of English language teaching in rural areas in context of Bangladesh.

The importance of this issue reflects the tragic consequences of migration policies in particular contexts or crises, and the emergence of work around migrants' journeys. The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europe"" (33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cecile Canut and Anaik Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language approach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks.

Given the changing dynamics of work, determining the right level of regulatory intervention in the labor market is critical. It is important on the one hand to provide businesses with the flexibility to meet their permanent and temporary staffing needs while, on the other, ensuring worker protections and the revision of rigid labor legislation, particularly in developing economies where vulnerable groups may be leftbehind. Shifts in labor market demand also call for new ways of thinking about skills development and training, including national policies and funding strategies that economies can utilize to prepare their citizens for the future.

The availability of trained interpreters from migrant communities was described as a key aspect in providing migrant-sensitive care. Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted. Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of the health-care system, integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system. Confidence was the third most common topic mentioned and related to trust in the health-care provider, ensuring cultural sensitivity in care provision and the ability to have agency. Studies indicated that, in cases where no trustful relationship was established, patients resorted to using traditional medicine and trusted ""their own resources"" from their community for treatment. Conversely, a systematic review that investigated the perceptions, attitudes and practices of health providers in the provision of health-care services for migrants found they were challenged not only by language and cultural barriers, but also by resource constraints within their workplaces, and incoherence between professional ethics and domestic laws that limited migrants' right to health care.24 Health-care providers used innovative means to ensure care provision in managing such clinical cases with civil society groups."

They can walk, run, hop, fly, or swim across jurisdictional boundaries or be borne there by wind and water currents. Thus, once IAS become established within one country, they pose a threat to an entire region, as well as trading partners and every country along a trading pathway (McNeely et al., 2001). There are more than 40 international agreements, as well as numerous codes of conduct that directly address IAS (Shine et al., 2000). However, few countries consider IAS a top priority and have invested in the development of well-coordinated policies and programs to address the problem. Developing countries that recognize the gravity of the situation and want to take immediate action are hampered by a lack of scientific, technological, and financial resources. Efforts of most governments to address IAS problems are poorly coordinated.

For example, it is important to distinguish between local and national actors, but there is some fuzziness in this regard, and this lack of clarity is arguably an issue in LHL in general. Local and national organizations can face distinct challenges and barriers to LHL: a large NGO that works all across the country can have a different experience from a local, more regionally focused entity. The fuzziness between local and national actors was more apparent in South Sudan, perhaps because the case study's research area was mainly in Juba, where there was little or no distinction between what was considered ""local"" and what was considered ""national."" 15 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan Another definitional challenge was distinguishing between a women's organization and a women-led organization. At the outset of this research, both country case studies understood women leaders to involve solely women-led organizations. While women-led organizations are key to this analysis, we also did not want to omit organizations with a strong gender focus or assume that just because an organization was led by a woman it had an interest in women's rights and gender justice.

The correspondent naturally wants to know something about your company before a transaction takes place. The reply should establish your company as a reliable supplier by providing a short but adequate introduction to the company, including bank references and other sources that confirm reliability. Your company's policy on exports should be stated, including cost, terms, and delivery. Your company may wish to respond with a pro forma invoice (see Chapter 13). * Enclose information on your company's goods or services. * If the company needs to meet a deadline, send the information by e-mail or, if preferred, fax. Unlike telephone communications, these methods may be used effectively despite differences in time zones and languages. * Keep a record of foreign inquiries. They may turn into definite prospects as your export business grows. If an intermediary handles exports for your company, the intermediary may use the information.

Corruption and lack of transparency in tender processes has been a great concern to U.S. companies. U.S. firms experience difficulties in day-to-day operations due to inappropriate demands from officials for ""facilitative"" payments. President Buhari, who was inaugurated in May 2015, made countering Nigeria's endemic corruption a centerpiece of his administration, but is widely seen in the run-up to 2019 elections as having made little progress in this area. Efforts to strengthen anticorruption measures have been hampered by inter-ministry infighting and partisan politics, including a stalemate in Senate confirmation of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission's Chair. Questions also remain regarding the Nigerian justice system's willingness and capacity to achieve convictions and appropriate sentencing for corruption-related crimes."

Jobs that empower, build agency, and respect rights are associated with greater trust and willingness to participate in civil society. Jobs that create economic and social ties may build incentives to work across boundaries and resolve conflict. And if people believe that job opportunities are available to them either now or in the future, their trust in others and their confidence in institutions may increase. Ultimately, jobs can influence social cohesion through their effects on social identity, networks, and fairness.

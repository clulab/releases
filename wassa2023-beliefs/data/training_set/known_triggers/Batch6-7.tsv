Because various computer networks are accessed through English and most textbooks used in universities are published in English (Khuwaileh & Shoumali, 2001, p.31). So students fully appreciate the importance of a good command of English language. As a result, many parents have started hiring private tutors for their sons and daughters for better English learning. Jordanian parents consider English the 'make or break' of their children's future and that the financial status of Jordanian families plays a crucial role in the English level of their families (Khuwaileh & Shoumali, 2001, p.31). The learners of Jordan seemed to be heavily dependent on private tutoring to help them operate well in their target situation. Sometimes they blamed school teachers' lack of competence which made necessary for them to hire private tutors.	So students fully appreciate the importance of a good command of English language.

UK, on torture techniques used in internment in Northern Ireland in 1971-1972, remained pending before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In October, the High Court in Northern Ireland quashed a decision by the Police Service of Northern Ireland to end preliminary inquiries into torture of the 14 ""Hooded Men"", who were abused while in detention in Northern Ireland by the British army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1971. RENDITION In January, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in the joined appeals inBelhaj and Others v. Jack Straw and OthersandRahmatullah v. Ministry of Defence and Another.It ruled that the government could not rely on the legal doctrines of ""sovereign immunity"" and ""foreign act of state"" to escape civil claims in the two cases alleging UK involvement in human rights violations by foreign governments. The first case concerned allegations by former Libyan opposition leader Abdul-Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudcharthat they had been subjected to rendition, torture and other illtreatment in 2004 by the US and Libyan governments, with the knowledge and cooperation of UK officials. The second case Amnesty International Report 2017/18 383 was brought by Yunus Rahmatullah, detained by UK forces in Iraq in 2004 before being handed over to US forces and allegedly tortured and imprisoned without charge for over 10 years. ARMED FORCES Allegations of war crimes committed by UK armed forces in Iraq between 2003 and 2008 remained under preliminary examination by the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC. On 3 December, the Office declared that there was a reasonable basis to believe that members of the UK armed forces committed war crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court against persons in their custody. An admissibility assessment was ongoing.

Officials have introduced risk-management approaches, such as the Pre-Arrival Assessment Reporting System. However, the majority of imports are still subject to inspection on arrival, causing delays and increased costs. Importers report erratic application of customs and other import regulations, lengthy clearance procedures, and corruption. The resulting delays can contribute to product deterioration and result in significant losses for importers of perishable goods. Additionally, Ghana's ports suffer from congested roads and lack a functioning rail system to transport freight, creating long waits for ships to berth at cargo terminals and for containers to be transported out of the ports. Ghana Ports and Harbor Authority (GPHA) is working to modernize both the Ports of Tema and Takoradi. In November 2016, Ghana launched a $1.5 billion public-private partnership between GPHA and Meridian Port Services, a partnership representing interests from the Netherlands and France, to quadruple the capacity of the Tema Port. This port expansion project is expected to be completed in 2019. Ghana has launched several initiatives over the past couple of years to support online information and processing of trade transactions, including the development of a National Single Window. In September 2017, Ghana introduced electronic (""paperless"") cargo clearance at ports to reduce clearance times.

For the remaining seven companies, Bengali is the primary language. However, for these companies English is required as a second language, and on average 41% of employees speak English. All of these factors underline the importance of English in the workplace and for the economy in general, and show why a high proportion of the population want to improve their English skills to the highest possible degree. The strongest demand for English speakers comes from foreign banks and investment companies, MNCs and public institutions.

cffebe5c-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor169.txt	Coted'ivoire? A benchmark scenario to gauge expected movement between employment sectors. The sections above provide a conceptual framework to consider the potential for agriculture and other sectors to generate employment and raise earnings for the poorer segments of society. This section presents a benchmark scenario outlining how much movement between sectors can realistically be expected in Coted'Ivoire over the 2015-2025 horizon. It starts from the employment situation in Coted'Ivoire in February 2014 and applies projections of population growth and growth rates for the main sectors of the economy over the next decade, as well as international historical estimates of the sectoral elasticity of employment in Africa and around the world. The projections forecast the composition of job growth over the next decade as well as the resulting effects on the country-wide employment structure. They provide a benchmark to consider how changes in productivity in agriculture or in other sectors, or changes in the composition of GDP growth, can influence the overall employment composition (holding sectoral elasticities of employment constant). The benchmark scenario is optimistic as it assumes high growth in industry (secondary), commerce, and services in the next decade, with more limited growth in agriculture (Table 2.3) (see AnnexB for more background on methodology and findings).49 48 Christiaensen, De Weerdt, and Todo (2013); Christiaensen and Todo (2014). 49 This scenario is also based on growth-employment elasticities from low-income countries. Projections suggest a continuing decline of the agricultural labor share, mostly counterbalanced by an increase in nonagricultural self-employment, which is expected to become the main source of employment (Figure2.12). Specifically, it is expected that the share of employment in agriculture could decrease from 51 percent in 2014 to 29 percent in 2025. In parallel, it is likely that nonagricultural selfemployment will become the main source of employment by 2025, 43 percent of the labor force is expected to be self-employed outside agriculture. The share of wage employment also increases, but it will remain the least prevalent type of employment, with less than 30 percent of the labor force.

On the other hand, categories are not simply interchangeable. The only principle that should apply in assigning categories is the appropriateness of a protected area's assigned management purpose within the system relative to the ecological needs of, and threats to, the species or ecosystem in the context of the entire landscape or seascape where that biodiversity occurs. The protected area objectives also need to be considered at the moment of reviewing and assigning a management category. In some cases, it may be best to increase the stringency of protection because of declines in the ecological or conservation status of a species or ecosystem within the protected area or across its distribution-e.g., part or all of a category V protected might be reassigned as a category Ib. In others, it might actually be more strategic to shift management to allow more flexibility in terms of sustainable use (e.g., from a category II protected area to a category VI).

As noted above, many people do not have access to drinking water sources that are considered improved. In addition, not all sources considered improved provide safe, good quality water. For example, some of the drinking water sources considered ""improved"" may not be adequately maintained and protected from outside contamination, including from naturally occurring elements such as arsenic, pollution from industry and agriculture and from poor sanitation.9 Furthermore, when the source of water is far away, the quantity of safe water that gets collected is less likely to be sufficient for minimum drinking needs or for good hygiene practices.10 It has been shown that the quantity of water that gets collected declines drastically if more than half an hour per trip is needed to collect the water.11 This is often the case in sub-Saharan Africa where 29percent of the population (37percent in rural areas and 14percent in urban areas) are at 30 minutes or more away from an improved source of drinking water.12 The health burden related to water and sanitation remains substantial in developing regions In 2012, an estimated 842,000 people died as a result of diarrhoea caused by inadequate drink- 8 UNICEF and WHO, 2015. 9 UNICEF and who, 2012. 10 UNICEF and who, 2011. 11 ibid. 12 Unweighted averages calculated by the United Nations Statistics Division based on data for 36 countries provided by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, 2014a.

However, rice-growing conditions vary because of topography and weather. In southeastern China, high temperature and adequate rainfall make an ideal environment for rice during a long growth period, and many areas grow two crops of rice per year. In the Yangtze River Valley, much of the land is planted to a rice-wheat rotation. In northeastern China, low temperature, a short growth period, little rainfall, and lack of water limit the rice area. The varieties grown in this area are typically japonica and are considered to be of higher quality than rice grown in other areas. There are some scattered rice areas in arid and semiarid regions of northwestern China.

The emphasis on families in the migration literature continues to grow, and International Migration has been among those journals to feel this emphasis. A major interest is with those family members who are leftbehind, the emotional difficulties they may face, as described by Fuller, despite modern ICTs; the effects on schooling as described by Yabiku and Agadjanian and, separately, by Kuepie; and the effects on marriages themselves which, as shown by Davis and Jennings and separately by Silver, et al., can be deeply troubling. But migration can itself be for marriage, and this phenomenon has received a great deal of attention, especially in Asia and especially in South Korea where marriage migration represents a high proportion of all migration to that country. The multicultural families that result are the object of Kim and Kilkey's study on integration outcomes for foreign brides to South Korea; Kim and Kilkey looked at the country's policy on multicultural families, regarding it as designed with the country's future population size in mind; and Cho considers cultural aspects of marriage migration to that country.

Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

This led to a Board-approved action plan to address inconsistencies and inefficiencies, with a particular focus on the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, authorities and resources of key roles in the partnership. In December 2018, the Board requested exploration of different options for adjustments to the country model, based on four agreed principles: >> A focus on country-level mutual accountability >> Reinforcing national government ownership, political will and capacity >> Rebalancing the country-level model to ensure GPE grants and processes support the development and effective implementation of high-quality, well-financed, government-owned education sector plans >> Achieving a reduction in GPE country-level processes and transaction costs while maintaining robust mechanisms for ensuring quality and managing risk The next steps include efforts in four key areas. The first seeks to strengthen country-level partnership and policy dialogue. Proposals for how to build on existing good practice and promote country-owned partnership agreements and ways to measure effectiveness are being considered.

However, access to these provisions has been a challenge. COVID-19 has not led to food production problems yet, and the food supply chain is relatively robust in most countries, apart from in Uganda and elsewhere for perishable foods. Across the Maintains countries, local markets have been shut (some intermittently) and there are some reports of increasing food inflation, which will exacerbate the impacts on nutrition. Some 8.3 million children have not received food via school feeding programmes; only Bangladesh has replaced this with high-energy biscuit provision.

Its purpose is to build capacity for the provision of taxonomic services, i.e. the identification of, and provision of information on, organisms. This capacity is inter alia essential for: * curbing the spread of IAS, including pests and disease * food security * eliminating poverty, especially among rural people * enhancing international trade in agricultural and horticultural products * conserving biological diversity and preventing the loss of natural ecosystems. For agricultural and horticultural quarantine services, a taxonomist can only be expected to identify a small proportion of the potentially harmful species that may move through any port of importation or exportation. Therefore, using current methods for organism identification, a cadre of taxonomists is needed for effective identification services, and each requires considerable training and years of experience. Building taxonomic capacity that depends on human expertise is, therefore, a long-term, costly exercise. The need, however, is vital, urgent, and massive. It is unrealistic to expect that a sufficient number of competent taxonomists will be trained within the foreseeable future, so new, cost-and time-effective mechanisms for providing identification services must be implemented.

This is also true of Japan, South Korea, Thailand, China and Russia.

But migration can itself be for marriage, and this phenomenon has received a great deal of attention, especially in Asia and especially in South Korea where marriage migration represents a high proportion of all migration to that country. The multicultural families that result are the object of Kim and Kilkey's study on integration outcomes for foreign brides to South Korea; Kim and Kilkey looked at the country's policy on multicultural families, regarding it as designed with the country's future population size in mind; and Cho considers cultural aspects of marriage migration to that country.

The lack of status, job security, or voice at work can lead people to feel disempowered and hopeless about the future and to stop participating in social networks.19 In extreme cases, unemployment can contribute to violence or social unrest.

They report results on 95 transport infrastructure projects (road and rail) built in China between 1984 and 2008 and compare these to 806 transport projects built in advanced economies. Data on 24 variables are collected for each investment, including cost variables, time aspects (decision, implementation and completion), competitiveness of the procurement process, proportion of foreign exchange costs, and benefits (such as freight usage). Their findings were as follows:  There is a tendency to underestimate project costs in China--actual costs, on average, are 30.6% higher than the final business case estimates (i.e. excluding preparation time) in real terms (removing the effects of inflation). This was particularly so in rail projects. Preliminary evidence suggests (since the size of projects could not be controlled for) that these overruns are not significantly different, statistically, compared to a rich democracies sample.  Projects in China were found to be finished with less time overruns than in advanced economies. However, they also find that this is associated with trading off quality, safety, social equity and the environment. These are outcomes that will need to be changed in order for China to meet its stated environmental objectives for the BRI.  With respect to benefits in traffic performance, the study finds evidence of poor resource allocation. The majority of routes have poor traffic volumes, while some have the opposite problem of extreme congestion.

However, underemployment levels are much higher at around 29% according to the same source. Both the unemployment and underemployment rates are higher in rural areas, as most large employers are based in the country's capital. For new graduates there are many opportunities available in both government and private industry in the larger cities of Bangladesh. Due to strong competition for jobs, a degree does not guarantee immediate employment. Graduates with a better command of English generally find jobs faster in private companies, where English is more in demand than in public institutions. Another factor to consider is the level of remittances coming into Bangladesh. According to the government, 92% of total remittances into the country are from salaried professionals based in other countries, mainly developed nations. The UK is a prime destination for many economic migrants, reflecting the strong historical ties between the two countries. In order for Bangladeshis to make the move to the UK to benefit from higher salaries, one of the skills they require is English.

An unreliable supply of electricity results in spoiled perishable goods, damage to sensitive equipment, and productivity losses. Firms adapt by buying generators and other expensive equipment to protect sensitive inventory and machinery. Allcott, Collard-Wexler, and O'Connell (2016) examine the effects of electricity shortages on input choices, revenue, and productivity in manufacturing plants in India between 1992 and 2010. The authors find that electrical shortages reduce the average plant's revenue by 6-8%, and that producer surplus drops by 10%, of which roughly half is due to the cost of backup generators. Moyo (2013) investigates the relationship between power outages and manufacturing productivity in Africa in 2002-05 and finds a negative relationship between both the number of hours per day without electricity and the percentage of output lost due to outages and productivity.

cffebe95-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor30.txt	There are two central points for intervention. And both make lives better. One of the greatest opportunities to increase human wellbeing is to slow down and eventually reverse population growth. This does not require coercive measures, in fact non-coercive ones are far more effective. And even more importantly, those investments make lives better, particularly for those who live in more fragile conditions today. Above all, this is the chance to invest in women, by giving them access to schooling, but also to family planning. This helps women to be more in control of their lives, and to contribute more effectively, for instance as community leaders or entrepreneurs. In many poorer parts of Africa, girls are excluded due to immediate economic hardship, and as a result poverty persists. When women attend school, they also have better chances of finding work and shaping their own lives. Their quality of life increases, as does that of their children and all other members of their family, men and women. Also, families become smaller. As a result there is more capacity for everyone living on limited resources. In the global economy it is beneficial for a country to have a gradually shrinking population. Many people think the opposite is true. They believe that competitiveness increases with a growing population. In an ecologically scarce world this no longer holds true.

There is also a tendency for women leaders to find it more challenging to engage at the national level as opposed to the community level where ""grassroots women's organizations with strong track records in advancing community development find themselves excluded and disconnected from national disaster risk reduction and recovery programs"" (Gupta and Leung 2010, iii).8 Breaking through the barriers between the community, local, national, and global levels remains a difficult venture. 24 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan It is important to recognize that some women's organizations may choose not to be part of the formal global humanitarian coordination system. One scholar working on women's humanitarian leadership in Haiti noted that several strong women's rights organizations opted out of the cluster system during the earthquake response, as they found it patriarchal and harmful to women's interests (Canadian Council for International Cooperation, interview, January 10th, 2018). It cannot be assumed, therefore, that all women's organizations want to, or feel the need to, be part of the humanitarian system if they see the humanitarian system as failing to meet the needs of women or perceive themselves as better able to achieve their gender justice aims outside of it. This is, in fact, one of the powerful arguments in support of LHL."

cffebe99-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor15.txt	"Transnational tribalism, immigration and social media platforms A big data study of Twitter during the peak of the so-called refugee crisis (October 2015 to May 2016) analysed almost 7.5 million tweets collected through hashtags such as #refugee, #refugeecrisis and #fluchtlinge.a The study examined the framing of refugees in the Twittersphere, and the extent to which the frames represented alternative voices. The analysis found that, overall, dominant frames revolved around security and safety on the one hand and humanitarianism on the other. The study also identified some explicitly racist hashtags linked to some of the security and safety frames. Linking any new issue to pre-existing hashtags--for example, #refugees and #tcot - points to an emerging dynamic in which new issues are subsumed and used for different political purposes. The researchers found that Twitter is no longer a social media platform that operates as a levelling field; rather, the long-standing presence of some has already conditioned the medium, ""socializing"" new tags in their own way and ""broadcasting"" to millions of followers. This points to the instrumentalization of Twitter, where it is used strategically to achieve certain political ends by specific interests, such as far-right activists. There was evidence of increasingly strident anti-immigration voices in Europe. Overall, the refugee debate on Twitter was caught between the security and racist frames on the one hand, and humanitarian responses on the other."

Whether as individual leaders in their communities or as grassroots women's organizations, there are countless examples of women's organizations working on the frontlines to help their communities prepare for and respond to humanitarian emergencies. In a 2010 report Suranjana Gupta and Irene Leung found that ""women's organizations have shown extraordinary capacities to mobilize women survivors to improve distribution of aid, access to resources, water and shelter, and making local institutions accountable in relief and rehabilitation"" (p. 1). Yet they also found that this contribution goes unrecognized and that ""women's organizations are forced to negotiate afresh to ensure their active participation in relief and rehabilitation processes"" (Gupta and Leung 2010, 1). Therefore when analyzing women's leadership in the context of LHL--a term that started being more widely used around 2014--it is important to keep in mind that a dearth of examples of women's leadership related specifically to LHL does not reflect a lack of women's leadership in the context of humanitarian action in general."

Learning mediated through edtech remains out of reach if electricity does not reach households, if families do not have computers or smartphones, or if internet access is not available (at appropriate bandwidth and speed) or is prohibitively expensive. Where limited access is available, boys are likely to be prioritised over girls. The digital gender divide means that there are multiple factors leading to gender-based digital exclusion. These include access-based challenges, affordability, lack of or lower levels of education, skills, and technological literacy, and inherent gender biases and socio-cultural norms (OECD, 2018). While smartphone use has grown rapidly, the GSMA found that in 2018 only 23% of sub-Saharan Africa's population used mobile internet regularly; as incomes are threatened, the cost of data may also become prohibitive (GSMA, 2019).

Living during times of manifold conflicts, Khaldun regarded asabiyah as the solidarity of small groups (tribes) that has the power to promote broader social integration.a Four centuries later, Emile Durkheim considered cohesion in the context of societal transformation.b He was particularly concerned with two different types of solidarity that he observed emerging through industrialization in Europe. Primitive societies, he found, were marked by mechanical solidarity and a strong collective ethos based on relatively homogeneous patterns of life and work. Advanced capitalist society, in contrast, with its complex division of labor, was marked by organic solidarity based on merit, respect for different roles within the labor force, and the need for moral regulation."

The review team identified 122 reviews (75 systematic reviews, of which 34 were meta-analyses, and 47 non-systematic reviews). CHW programmes included in these reviews were diverse in the interventions provided, selection and training of CHWs, supervision, remuneration and integration into the health system. Features that appeared to enable positive CHW programme outcomes included community embeddedness (whereby community members have a sense of ownership of the programme and positive relationships with the CHWs), supportive supervision, continuous education, adequate logistical support and supplies, and integration with the health system. The review team found gaps in the evidence, including on the rights and needs of CHWs, on effective approaches to training and supervision, on CHWs as community change agents, and on the influence of health system decentralization, social accountability, and governance. While the findings of the systematic review of reviews, having captured evidence from independently commissioned reviews, were typically not specific to the focus of the PICO questions, in several cases they provided useful complementary evidence and contextual information on some of the PICO questions. 6.2 Systematic reviews on the 15 PICO questions The Centre for Evidence and Implementation, in consortium with the University of Melbourne, Campbell Collaboration, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), University of Toronto, University of Newcastle, University of Sydney, University of Adelaide, University of Iowa, American Institutes for Research and Aga Khan University, was selected through a competitive bidding process to develop the systematic reviews for each of the 15 PICO questions selected by the GDG.

On one hand this phenomenon creates a ""brain drain"" that has a detrimental effect on Cameroon's development. On the other, increasing international mobility also offers notable benefits for Cameroon, such as the development of new networks with developed countries. The country may also benefit from the positive influence of students returning with new skills, information and international contacts. The overall impact is therefore positive. Cameroon's higher educational institutes do receive a number of foreign students seeking to pursue higher education in English. For example, the University of Buea has a number of nationals from Equatorial Guinea, where the official language is Spanish. Young Cameroonians prefer to go abroad for higher education, especially in professional fields such as IT, engineering and medicine, as they perceive the quality of tuition in foreign establishments as being higher. There are a number of reasons for young people to study abroad. These include access to job opportunities and the economic benefits in more developed countries. Favoured destinations for Cameroonian students include France, the UK, the US, Germany and Belgium. There is a lack of country-specific statistics available on Cameroonian migrants. However, most migration from Cameroon is educational in nature rather than political or purely economic. The Ministry of Education estimates that close to 30% of university students of Cameroonian nationality currently study abroad."

Yet the power of patriarchal structures and entrenched ways of working that consistently ignore or devalue women's contribution to humanitarian action cannot be underestimated. At its heart, LHL takes on long-standing development issues rooted in colonialism and other forms of inequality, and it challenges North-South dynamics as well as the perceived hierarchy of global, national, and local. Yet LHL is itself situated within a patriarchal system and has, depending on context, its own set of biases and unequal power dynamics.

The UK, Australia and Canada are the most popular destinations for overseas study. According to RMMRU, levels of student migration are expected to rise in future as more young people seek opportunities abroad, with improving English language skills cited as one of the most important factors. Several projects were undertaken during the review period by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with funds from the World Bank. These typically aimed to improve overall efficiency in schools, as well as improve access to education. They included projects to recruit more female teachers and improve school management and the curriculum. Projects were also launched to improve teacher training and expand the existing scholarship programme. While not specifically promoting the English language, these improvements will have a significant and positive impact on the standard of English language education in Bangladesh.

In some countries, public support has been provided to BA associations, networks or groups to help start these organisations. For instance, EBAN was created in 1999 as a federation of BANs across Europe with financial support of the European Commission. In the US, it was the Kauffman Foundation which supported the creation of the Angel Capital Association (ACA) in 2004. In some cases, however, the public support to start national associations did not produce the desired impact, due to relatively immature markets and the difficulty for these associations to build enough momentum to develop (OECD, 2011a).Some policy measures target the specific skills required for angel investing, promoting training, mentoring and coaching, although this type of measures have been less popular than tax incentives or financial support. In the US, the Kauffman Foundation created the Angel Capital Education Foundation (ACEF), which offers education programmes about angel investing, with the engagement of experienced angel investors as lead instructors (OECD, 2011a). 410. On the demand-side, investment readiness programmes are intended to help entrepreneurs develop their business plans and presentations, in order to appeal to angel investors. To do so, emphasis is placed on better understanding the needs and expectations of potential investors and how to present a business plan that appeals to these expectations. 411. Other measures that aim to improve information flows and networking opportunities between financiers and entrepreneurs, including business incubators and accelerators, may also concern BAs. The support to broader networking activity in the entrepreneurial ecosystem may also improve the exit prospects of BAs, as these are able to strengthen linkages with other players, such as VC funds, which may step in at a later stage of the investment, or large companies, which might become M&A partners.

Seguro Popular is the most rapidly growing program, claiming a coverage of more than 50 million by April 2012.e But some preliminary research finds that non-contributory programs in general, and Seguro Popular, in particular, may induce informality or, at least, discourage formal employment.f Meanwhile, the debate about the universalization of health insurance is very much alive in Mexico. Academics and policy makers argue over it, and it is also a topic of political controversy. Much pivots on how much universalization will cost. Estimates vary widely from no incremental costs because of efficiency and tax collection gains to relatively large costs when accounting for long-term demographic changes. These differences originate from different methodologies, which indicate the complexity of the topic and the difficulty in gauging the full implications of the reform.g Mexico's debate on formalization needs to be cast in a broader context. In recent years, poverty and unemployment have increased while real wages have been stagnant. But other measures of wellbeing, such as access to education, health, and social security, have continued to improve.h Average productivity has been growing, but slowly, which can be due to an excessive churning of jobs and firms.i Demographic trends still show high fertility rates for a large share of the population, which leads to a social reproduction of poverty and informality.j Whether sweeping changes in labor and tax legislation as well as in the organization of social protection would substantially reduce informality is still an open question.

Little threat to English from other foreign languages By 2015, the number of English speakers at any level in Bangladesh is expected to reach around 25% of the population, with around 15% of the population having a good level of English. This increase will be driven partly by the government's commitment to improving education, and more importantly by individuals seeking to improve their career prospects. There is little threat to the use of English from any other foreign language in Bangladesh. No other foreign language is as widely used by business and government in the country.

Also, as noted in Section 2.2 (main challenges to safe use), over-use (as opposed to judicious use) is still common. That more highly toxic pesticides are often selected over less toxic may be due to limited availability of less toxic products, high cost of less toxic products, or lack of awareness of these products. Also, it is likely that farmers and extension officers are more accustomed to using the older, more highly toxic products. In addition, as stated in the Georgia Economic Prosperity Initiative (EPI) PERSUAP, farmers prefer to see insects killed quickly, so they are more likely to choose a highly toxic product.

Contract negotiation and closure are important, but ultimately your company must get paid. Exporters naturally want to get paid as quickly as possible, whereas importers usually prefer to delay payment until they have received or resold the goods. Because of the intense competition for export markets, making a sale often depends on your ability to offer attractive payment terms. You should be aware of the many financing options open to you so that you can choose the most acceptable one to both the buyer and your company. In many cases, government assistance in export financing for small and medium-sized businesses can increase your company's options. Before making financing decisions, you should consider: * The need for financing to make the sale. In some cases, favorable payment terms make a product more competitive: A buyer who had preferred buying from someone else might buy your product instead because of shorter or more secure credit terms. On the other hand, a sale can be lost if the competition offers better terms on a similar product. * The length of time the product is being financed. The term of the loan required determines how long you will have to wait before you receive payment from the buyer and influences your choice of how to finance the transaction. * The cost of different methods of financing. Interest rates and fees vary, and an exporter may expect to assume some or all of the financing costs. Before submitting a pro forma invoice to the buyer, you must understand how those costs affect price and profit. * The risks associated with financing the transaction. The riskier the transaction, the harder and more costly it will be to finance. The political and economic stability of the buyer's country can also be an issue. To provide financing for either accounts receivable or the production or purchase of the product for sale, the lender may require the most secure methods of payment--a letter of credit (possibly confirmed) or export credit insurance or a guarantee.

Among the barriers to women's leadership in the examined humanitarian crises are sociocultural notions about what women leaders and women's organizations are able to do. As highlighted by the case studies, the women's organizations that are involved in humanitarian response tend to engage more in traditional service delivery than in strategic gender programming, owing both to the need to conform to the expectations of traditional humanitarian actors in order to access funding opportunities and to the perceived divide between humanitarian, development, and peace programming--a divide that many women's organizations do not recognize. The report underscores the need for humanitarian action to do more to recognize the leadership of women and women's organizations, including by encouraging the participation of women's organizations in LHL-focused spaces such as humanitarian networks like the National Alliance for Humanitarian Actors in Bangladesh and acknowledging their role in peace negotiation processes in South Sudan.

Data collection by CHWs is a potentially meaningful yet still underresearched pathway towards improving community health services (14). This potential should be balanced with data ownership, access and individual patient confidentiality issues. 7.11.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that most published evidence supports a role for CHWs in data collection and use, and this finding is consistent with the broader literature on health information systems and quality improvement. As the evidence base is characterized by a low level of certainty and considering that the most appropriate strategies may vary by context, the GDG adopted a conditional recommendation in favour of the policy option under consideration. Recognizing the potential pitfalls of overburdening CHWs with data collection tasks, the GDG focused on identifying enablers for successful CHW contributions to data collection, collation and use. 7.11.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.11) on the question - ""In the context of community health worker (CHW) programmes, should practising CHWs collect, collate, and use health data versus not?""

In an article on women's leadership in humanitarian settings in Central America, Lara Seigneur and Jose Chacon of Oxfam America interviewed nine experienced women leaders, finding that ""these women leaders have had to also battle unequal 22 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan gender norms that consistently undercut their valuable knowledge and expertise, and diminish[ed] the perception of their leadership"" (2017, 2). The women leaders reported being turned away from conducting field assessments in conflict zones by the military, who said that they needed permission from their ""male manager"" (Seigneur and Chacon 2017, 1).

They 186 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 were subjected to smear campaigns by both state and non-state actors to discredit their work, and were regularly targeted with intimidation, threats, and attacks. In June, three members of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) were attacked by armed assailants while they were in a car, returning from a meeting. Local NGOs said that the justice system continued to be misused to harass and discourage human rights defenders. Unnecessary and excessive use of force by security forces during peaceful protests wasalso reported. The vast majority of attacks registered against human rights defenders remained unpunished, as a result of multiple obstacles hindering investigations and trials. There was little progress in the investigation into the killing in March 2016 of Berta Caceres, the Indigenous environmental defender and cofounder of COPINH. The public hearings of eight suspects detained in relation to the case were postponed on multiple occasions. Independent experts revealed a lack of due diligence in the investigations, including a lack of prosecution of other individuals potentially involved in the crime. There was no information about any progress made by the Public Prosecutor in identifying those responsible for planningher killing. Although some progress was made to protect human rights defenders through the National Mechanism to Protect Human Rights Defenders, Journalists, Social Commentators and Justice Officials, efforts to ensure their comprehensive protection remained insufficient. New provisions of the Criminal Code on terrorism and related criminal offences approved by Congress in February and September were defined in an overly broad and vague manner, contrary to the principle of legality. The provisions could lead to the arbitrary and inadequate application of the Code against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders, which couldfurther criminalize their work and obstruct social movements.

And so we've begun developing and incorporating visual aids, videos, icons, logos, things that will help them understand how to use the product, what it's designated for. And we're able to take that and apply it elsewhere, because it is a universal need, but it's being driven by a specific market area force at the moment.""

cffebeca-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor85.txt	"Biocapacity Assessment A national biocapacity calculation starts with the total amount of bioproductive land available. ""Bioproductive"" refers to land and water that supports significant photosynthetic activity and accumulation of biomass, ignoring barren areas of low, dispersed productivity. This is not to say that areas such as the Sahara Desert, Antarctica, or Alpine mountaintops do not support life; their production is simply too widespread to be directly harvestable by humans. Biocapacity is an aggregated measure of the amount of land available, weighted by the productivity of that land. It represents the ability of the biosphere to produce crops, livestock (pasture), timber products (forest), and fish, as well as to uptake carbon dioxide in forests. It also includes how much of this regenerative capacity is occupied by infrastructure (built-up land). In short, it measures the ability of available terrestrial and aquatic areas to provide ecological services. A country's biocapacity for any land use type is calculated as EQFYFABC ..= where BC is the biocapacity, A is the area available for a given land use type, and YF and EQF are the yield factor and equivalence factor, respectively, for the country land use type in question. The yield factor is the ratio of national to world average yields. It is calculated as the annual availability of usable products and varies by country and year. Equivalence factors translate the area supplied or demanded of a specific land use type (e.g. world average cropland, grazing land, etc.) into units of world average biologically productive area (global hectares) and varies by land use type and year. 13 ."

Rather, we classify households in terms of whether there are both male and female adults (dualadult households), only female adults, or only male adults.

cffebecf-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor46.txt	Many persons acquire their impairment while they are employed. However, in some countries, there are no policies or programmes in place to support job retention or return to work, in such instances, particularly if the employee has had to leave work for some time.414 Evidence shows that the longer the absence from work, the more difficult it is to bring a person back into the labour market. But national initiatives have been taken to counter this trend and support the retention or return to work of persons who acquired their impairment while they were employed. The Return to Work programme of the Malaysian Social Security organization is an example of a good practice in this area. The efforts in Malaysia focus initially on getting the person with disabilities back to the company where she/he was working before (same job or, if the same job is no longer an option, a similar job). If this is not possible, efforts are made to employ the returning worker at another company and, only if this has not worked out, the focus is on providing self-employment opportunities. Ensuring job retention and return to work for persons with mental health conditions and persons with psychosocial disabilities is particularly challenging, as issues of stigma related to mental health still persist.415 Public policies to address this issue include individual placement and support, which has some common elements with supported employment and is used particularly for persons with psychosocial disabilities.

Communities were never informed about the amount of money offered to them and were rarely informed about what they could expect to receive. People were grateful for what they did receive, but were not sure whether they had received all aid that was available. People were often called to meetings to be counted and put on lists, but were not told the purpose of the exercise. Nobody was aware of the full reconstruction picture in the communities visited. This lack of information led to a sense of powerlessness and dependency. NGOs do not generally reveal their budgets to the local government; the local government does not share financial information with the NGOs; the central government does not reveal the amounts sent to the local government; nobody informs the recipients about possible goods and funds that may be available. The weight of power over information rests squarely with the ""giver"" and not the ""receiver."" The community survey also found that community participation in recovery remained rudimentary and generally consisted of providing labor, participating in committees, and complying with a set of rules decided by external agents.

Most of those killed were from poor urban communities.1 Despite evidence that police and gunmen with links to the police killed or paid others to kill alleged drug offenders in a wave of extrajudicial executions, authorities continued to deny any unlawful deaths. In January, the President suspended the violent anti-drugs campaign for one month following the killing in police custody of a Republic of Korea national. In March, the unlawful killings of suspected drug offenders in police operations resumed, as did drug-related killings by other armed individuals. The number of killings on a single day in police anti-drug operations reached 32 in August. Police continued to rely on unverified lists of people allegedly using or selling drugs. In September, the killings of three teenagers within a few weeks sparked a national outcry. CCTV footage and witness statements contradicted police accounts of the killing of one of the three, 17-year-old Kian delos Santos, who according to forensic experts and witnesses appeared to have been extrajudicially executed.2 In October, President Duterte announced that the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency would take over the anti-drugs campaign from the Philippine National Police. However, it was announced less than two months later that police might rejoin anti-drug operations, despite unresolved issues. Meaningful investigations into killings of alleged drugs offenders failed to take place; no police officers were known to have been held to account. Relatives of victims continued to be fearful of reprisals if they filed complaints against police. 300 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 .

At least 30 detainees were released during the year; however, the National Security Service (NSS) and the Military Intelligence Directorate continued to conduct arbitrary arrests and hold perceived government opponents in prolonged detention without charge or trial. Individuals were denied the right to have their detention reviewed by a court and were often subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. Detention conditions were harsh; detainees were regularly denied access to their family members, adequate food and clean water. The conditions, including inadequate medical care, contributed to the deaths of some detainees. The NSS released 21 detainees without charge from prolonged arbitrary detention in a prison in the NSS headquarters compound in the Jebel neighbourhood of Juba; one was released in January, two in March, one in April, two in May, and 15 in August. Most had been detained for between two and three years. At least five others remained in detention in the compound, accused of communicating with or supporting the opposition. A sixth man, James Gatdet, former SPLM/A-IO spokesperson, detained in the same facility, was charged with inciting violence, ""treason"" and ""publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to Southern Sudan"". He was detained after he was forcibly returned from Kenya to South Sudan in November 2016.4 Mike Tyson, Alison Mogga Tadeo, Richard Otti, and Andria Baambe, also held without charge for alleged links with the opposition, died in the same facility between February and July as a result of harsh conditions of detention and inadequate access to medical care.

Professionals must refrain from carrying out a transaction which they know or suspect to be related to money laundering or terrorist financing before having informed the FIU. The FIU can give instructions not to execute one or more operations relating to the transaction or the customer.

They may also commission research with partners in academia, applied researchers, intergovernmental organizations and think tanks. The increasing relevance of migration has led to governments providing funding for empirical work directly (rather than indirectly through national research councils, funds or grant bodies), thereby opening up new research areas and broadening the scope of migration studies.12 This has led to some criticism of government-commissioned research being overly focused on policy issues and for, at times, suggesting ""simplistic, short-term remedies to complex, long-term social issues"",13 or of researchers being used to legitimize immigration policy.14 While this may be a valid concern, especially for commissioned research, governments continue to be significant funders (if not the most significant) of academic research in many countries, including of research on migration.

cffebee2-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor93.txt	The second is a measure of autonomy that reflects a person's ability to act on what he or she values. This indicator probes the person's own understanding of the situation and how he or she balances different motivations--to avoid punishment or social disapproval and to act on his or her own values (Alkire 2007). The indicator adapts the measure of autonomy developed by psychologists Richard Ryan, E. L. Deci, Valery Chirkov, and others working in Self-determination Theory (see Chirkov, Ryan, and Deci 2011). A subindex is constructed from answers to the following: (1) My actions in [area of decision-making] are partly because I will get in trouble with someone if I act differently, (2) Regarding [area of decision-making] I do what I do so others don't think poorly of me, and (3) OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 9 Regarding [area of decision-making] I do what I do because I personally think it is the right thing to do. The areas of decision-making refer to (1) agricultural production, (2) which inputs to buy, (3) which types of crops to grow, (4) when to take or who would take crops to market, and (5) livestock production. An individual is adequate on autonomy if his or her actions are relatively more motivated by his or her own values than by coercion or fear of others' disapproval. Note that this autonomy indicator, unlike decision-making indicators, captures the situation of women living in female-only households, who may indeed be empowered as sole decision makers but whose autonomy may still be deeply constrained by social norms or force of circumstance. It also reflects the situation in joint households--a joint decision may be more or less autonomous, depending on circumstances.

They do not account for differences in actual hours worked or differences in human capital. After controlling for these sectoral differences in labor efforts using additional information from household surveys, Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) demonstrate, for example, that the average ratio of nonagricultural to agricultural labor productivity among African countries reduces from 6 to 3.3. Similarly, Vollrath (2013) finds that sectoral misallocation of labor explained only 12 percent of the cross-country income variation in his sample of 42 countries, when correcting the sectoral employment numbers from FAO17 for sectoral differences in time use and educational achievements, as opposed to 32 percent, when using unadjusted sectoral employment.18 Twelve percent is still asignificant amount of variation, especially when considering that educational differences are usually thought to explain 10-15 percent of cross-country income variation. But it is significantly less than what has been reported commonly, with the simulated gains from sectoral labor reallocation much lower than commonly assumed, and most likely still an upper bound. For example, turning to the sectoral output measure (the numerator), which is typically obtained from the national accounts, this is also bound to exert further upward bias on the gap. Across 10 countries, Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) estimated the labor effort adjusted nonagricultural to agricultural productivity ratio19 to be on average 2.6 when using sectoral value added from the macro data versus 2.2 when estimating sectoral value added from the household surveys. National accounts tend to miss food produced for own consumption, for example, which in low-income countries often makes up an important part of total agricultural output.20 Accounting for differences in capital intensity would bring the gap down further, especially in resource-rich countries, of which Africa counts many.

That's the best achievement in life.""69 Ela Bhatt, a lawyer and the founder of Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India, described her struggle with the language of work, given the multiplicity of tasks that people do every day and over time: ""A small farmer works on her own farm. In tough times, she also works on other farms as a laborer. When the agriculture season is over, she goes to the forest to collect gum and other forest produce. Year round, she produces embroidered items either at a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader who comes to her village to buy goods. Now, how should her trade be categorized? Does she belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sector, or the home-based work sector? Should she be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker?""70 These questions are not merely semantic. The words and categories that are used to describe work have tangible implications. Views on what a job is and what it means almost inevitably influence views on what policies for jobs should look like. Those for whom the word job is associated with the image of a worker in an office or a factory, with an employer and a paycheck, may focus on a supportive investment climate for firms. Those for whom the word also encompasses farming, street vending, waste picking, and domestic employment may think of jobs policies as including land reform, agricultural extension, urban policies, or the provision of voice to the most vulnerable workers."

Previously their livelihoods had consisted of farming, fishing, informal trading, handicrafts, brewing of traditional alcohol, wood cutting and charcoal making, working on the salt flats, and livestock (cattle). The women did the agricultural work, the trading, and the production of the traditional alcohol. Men worked on the salt flats, fished, and kept livestock. After the floods, the majority of the population received improved housing but had lost their livelihoods. Fishing activities have declined, and farming has been difficult due to the drought. Because of a lack of money in the economy, petty trading has not been revived. The families are mainly surviving on food for work projects two years after the floods. Women continue to try to farm. And some are beginning to keep chickens again. Some of the women said they had started a new business of selling meat from game hunted by the men. Men are unable to find work or alternative income sources so they work on the roads in the food for work programs; they no longer have boats or cattle, as they were lost in the floods.

These norms feed into an idea that ""women are not capable to be leaders"" (Lindley-Jones 2018, 6). In addition, right-wing movements around the world are strongly pushing back against women's rights and gender justice, impeding women and women's organizations from engaging in decision-making spaces. According to a report from CIVICUS, women's rights groups were the most commonly threatened group in the civil rights sphere (2018, 9). The dangers of a backlash are real. Women's organizations that seek to advance gender equality and challenge gender norms will, by the nature of their mission, come into conflict with powerholders who do not want to share or lose the influence they have (Esplen 2013). In a survey on community decision-making on preparedness in Pakistan, several study participants expressed concern about a backlash from men if women were to engage more in public spaces, suggesting instead ""that women in conservative communities might need to request permission from their male counterparts in order to participate in public decision-making spaces"" (Van Brabant and Patel 2018, 26). These barriers to participation grow from a patriarchal terrain that has consistently devalued and discouraged women's voice and agency, particularly in public spaces."

Again, we dropped this indicator because the answers did not seem consistent: whereas in Guatemala and Uganda the percentage of adequate men is much higher than the percentage of adequate women (differences of 21.5 percentage points in Guatemala and 5.4 percentage points in Uganda), in Bangladesh the percentage of adequate women is 62.7 percent, compared to 19.7 percent of men.

Levels of women's acceptance ranged from 3 per cent in Ukraine (2012) and Serbia (2010) to 92 per cent in Guinea (2012). Levels of men's acceptance ranged from 7 per cent in Serbia (2010) to 81 per cent in Timor-Leste (2009-2010). It should be noted that it is difficult to compare reported levels of acceptance of wife-beating across countries and contexts because the willingness to talk about violence and attitudes towards it vary, which can affect people's response. In almost all of the countries where more than one year of data are available, the level of women's and men's acceptance of wife-beating decreased over time.54 Although it may be assumed that wife-beating is more widely justified by men than women, in most countries levels of reported acceptance are actually lower among men than women. 52 United Nations, 2010. 53 WHO, 2005; Promundo, International Center for Research on women, 2012. 54 Statistical Annex, available at http://unstats.un.org/ unsd/gender/worldswomen.html.

cffebefe-fc0b-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor59.txt	Government targets global relationships According to the Organisation of the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Rwanda saw substantial growth in FDI over 2005-2008, with investment increasing by 90% to reach US$930.6 million in 2008. This reflects government efforts to lower corruption and use aid in an effective and transparent way, making investment more attractive. The president's effective wooing of potential US and UK investors has also brought investment, as well as a willingness to look to non-traditional investment partners. South Africa, for example, has provided investment for luxury hotels and shopping centres. This contributed to economic performance and boosted the need for English speakers. Rwandan economy largely agricultural, limited investment opportunities The switch to English in the education system is cited as part of the government's strategy to bolster FDI. Education Minister Charles Murigande stated in 2010 that the adoption of English is a logical choice given the countries with which Rwandans do business, citing Dubai, Malaysia, China and Japan as examples. However, in terms of actual revenue, Rwandan FDI levels are low. Without the hydrocarbon reserves that saw massive FDI inflows into other regional markets - Nigeria's FDI in 2009, for example, was US$5,851 million compared with Rwanda's US$119 million - opportunities for investment are limited. The country remains an essentially agricultural economy, but the government's determination to create a knowledge-based economy from the ground up will increase the need for investment in the long term.

For example , one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season ( kharif season ) because of paying for his daughter 's wedding , with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year ( SSI :13 ) .	Expenses related to cultural activities Households struggling to access food via rice farming strategies remained saddled with other income stresses. These could be large significant events such as weddings or repeat small-scale household expenditures, e.g., for medicine. Weddings presented households with substantial costs, but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor. As a result, scarce financial resources were not invested into enhancing returns from rice farming. For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13). The costs of weddings often exceeded rice farmers' financial capabilities, resulting in loan taking or sales of land. The knock-on effect is reduced investment in rice cropping, increased loan taking, or asset sales serving to reduce rice cropping households' long-term climate resilience.	For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13).

Integrating sacred sites , or more broadly , the perception of sacredness of nature , effectively into conservation plans is only possible when approached across ideological , physical and institutional borders .	Care needs to be taken to ensure that cultural and spiritual values do not jeopardise biodiversity values and that conversely the management of a protected area does not damage the site's sacred values. Integrating sacred sites, or more broadly, the perception of sacredness of nature, effectively into conservation plans is only possible when approached across ideological, physical and institutional borders. In short this is a process which integrates knowledge and wisdom with biodiversity conservation. Therefore, including sacred sites in all protected area categories builds on their intercultural and crosscutting values which, in turn, can produce equitable synergies between spiritual, cultural and natural diversity in support of more holistic conservation objectives.	Integrating sacred sites, or more broadly, the perception of sacredness of nature, effectively into conservation plans is only possible when approached across ideological, physical and institutional borders.

Agriculture is a dominant force in the economy at 38 % of GDP in 1998 , with 85 % of the population engaged in agricultural activities .	National rice yields during 1995-2000 were among the world's lowest. The following are the major constraints to sustainable rice production in Chad: * Low temperature during the off-season in irrigated areas * Recurrent drought and flood in rainfed lowland areas * Lack of input supplies: improved seeds, fertilizer, and credit * Lack of small farm equipment, especially for postharvest operations * Lack of effective farmer organizations and cooperatives * Poor maintenance of irrigation facilities * Poor road networks and marketing systems * Weak research and extension support The Republic of CHAD is a landlocked country in the Sahel region of Africa. The country is divided into three regions: desert (the Sahara) in the north, occupying 40% of the total area; plains in the central part, used mainly for grazing; and fertile lands in the south that are more tropical and in which most of the population lives. Agriculture is a dominant force in the economy at 38% of GDP in 1998, with 85% of the population engaged in agricultural activities. Arable land, however, is only 3% of the total.

Misaligned incentives exist when good jobs for development are not rewarding enough to individuals or profitable enough to farms and firms. Data and analysis can be used to identify gaps between the individual and the social value of jobs. Arguably, many key areas in development economics deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can be applied to measure the tax burden on capital and labor and to assess the extent of cross-subsidization between individuals or firms. Labor economics methods can be used to uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kinds of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on poverty reduction. Productivity studies can help quantify the spillovers from employment in FDI companies, in firms connected to global markets, or in functional cities.

Rice farming is precarious ; it does not generate resources to allow farmers to effectively respond to climate hazards and necessitates a range of coping strategies to sustain livelihoods .	Rice farming is precarious; it does not generate resources to allow farmers to effectively respond to climate hazards and necessitates a range of coping strategies to sustain livelihoods. Climate hazards, such as the floods in 2008 and Cyclone Phailin interact with this livelihood-farming system to amplify vulnerabilities and limit opportunities for improved rice cropping. For example, many farmers are dependent upon loans to support subsistence rice farming, and rice farming does not generate returns to pay back loans. To be able to repay loans, to obtain credit for the following season, households often sold small portions of their harvest, which was already insufficient, used remittances if available, or sought daily wage labor[11]. Remittances did not provide an income flow to stimulate growth of climate resilient and productive rice cropping. Remittances from high-skilled migrants were rarely invested to increase returns from rice cropping but more often spent on building large concrete (pukka) homes. Remittances from low-skilled migrants were not of sufficient quantity to facilitate investment to boost rice cropping; these remittances just covered immediate household needs in normal times.

"In April, the National Centre for Human Rights published a report that detailed ongoing human rights violations by security forces during arrest, including late-night security raids where excessive force was used, and in pre-trial detention in temporary detention facilities. Detainees were denied access to a lawyer during interrogations, and faced torture and other ill-treatment. The report also documented poor detention conditions and the lack of a classification system to protect detainees' safety, including by holding incompatible categories of detainees in the same cell. In mid-2017, Parliament enacted laws that guaranteed suspects the right of access to a lawyer on arrest, created a legal aid fund, and limited the use of pre-trial detention as an ""exceptional measure"" for specific purposes. The new laws set a maximum three-month period for those charged with minor offences, and up to 18 months for serious charges. The legislation also introduced alternatives to pre-trial detention, such as electronic monitoring, travel bans and house arrest but did not cover detention under the General Intelligence Directorate. ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION The authorities continued to detain suspects under the 1954 Crime Prevention Law that allowed detentions of up to one year without charge or trial or any means of legal remedy. It was used particularly in cases related to terrorism, espionage, treason, drugs and counterfeiting. The NGO Sisterhood Is Global Institute in Jordan reported that women who were victims of domestic violence or at risk of socalled honour crimes were held under administrative detention for their protection.

In short this is a process which integrates knowledge and wisdom with biodiversity conservation .	Care needs to be taken to ensure that cultural and spiritual values do not jeopardise biodiversity values and that conversely the management of a protected area does not damage the site's sacred values. Integrating sacred sites, or more broadly, the perception of sacredness of nature, effectively into conservation plans is only possible when approached across ideological, physical and institutional borders. In short this is a process which integrates knowledge and wisdom with biodiversity conservation. Therefore, including sacred sites in all protected area categories builds on their intercultural and crosscutting values which, in turn, can produce equitable synergies between spiritual, cultural and natural diversity in support of more holistic conservation objectives.

As households get richer, the demand for food as a share of total spending goes down and so does the demand from agriculture for labor. It has been widely observed across history that as countries develop, the share of agriculture in the economy and employment declines (Figure2.1). These structural and occupational transformations at the macro level reflect people's demand behavior at the micro level, that is, their relatively larger demand for non-food than for food as they get richer.15 As a result, the share of spending on food declines as incomes rise (widely known as Engel's Law), even though, in absolute terms, spending on food still increases. At the macro level this translates in a declining share of agriculture in GDP as countries develop, as well as a declining share of employment in agriculture.

In order to scale up these initiatives , however , results show that government policies and programmes are needed to improve market structure , public extension services and subsidies , and access to credit and loans for alternative crops ( 67 ) .	Crop substitution programmes While anecdotal evidence supports the finding that tobacco could be substituted with other crops that may be equally profitable, a systematic analysis of this issue is needed. A natural starting point would be a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the effects of removing farmers from tobacco production altogether on economic variables such as employment, skills, output, wages etc. Recent research has shown that smallholder farmers are receptive to shifting out of tobacco production when conditions allow. In order to scale up these initiatives, however, results show that government policies and programmes are needed to improve market structure, public extension services and subsidies, and access to credit and loans for alternative crops (67). Tobacco farmers, like most smallholder farmers in low-and middle-income countries, need policy reforms that put agricultural development at the centre of public services (215). Recognizing that such policy reforms can take time, and that growing tobacco undermines the economic growth and human and environmental health of farming communities, the development of government programmes designed specifically for the transition of tobacco farmers to alternative sustainable livelihoods are desirable in the immediate term.

The targeting of the investment climate may not necessarily be aimed at industrial sectors, however. Targeting can focus on gender, as when policies aim to increase labor market participation by women, or on spatial concerns, as in urbanization policies or policies for regional development. Or it can focus on firm size, as when policies support the development of small and medium enterprises. Good jobs for development differ across countries. The jobs agenda may involve making smallholder farming more productive in an agrarian economy, preserving international competitiveness in a resource-rich country, or fostering competition in activities employing skilled labor in a country with high youth unemployment.

Communities : Communities were able to state clearly the safe areas ( above flooding ) in the vicinity of the villages .	"Agencies (national and international): Many of the agencies involved in the post-emergency phase of the disaster have established contingency plans including reinstating emergency departments within the organizations; training of staff; and establishing written procedures for emergency response. Two years after the event agencies were still sensitive to issues concerning emergencies; however, as levels of funding for emergency contingency begin to wane, they may not be able to support the measures they have put into place (i.e. funding of emergency officers, regular training updates for staff). Local government: The four District Administrators interviewed during the field work were enthusiastic about the coordination and collaboration that was apparent during the post-emergency period. In northern Inhambane the coordination mechanisms still exist and the main agencies meet regularly. However, it appears that there is still much to be done to increase the capacity of the District Administrations to prepare for future disasters. The overall impression is that although the local government maybe aware of the need for contingency planning there has, to date, been little real capacity building to support the good intentions. Communities: Communities were able to state clearly the safe areas (above flooding) in the vicinity of the villages. They were also clear that they would respond to flood warnings in the future. However, in the areas covered by the fieldwork, no agency was working with the communities to carry out vulnerability assessments on which to base mitigation plans. Questions of mitigation were not raised by the communities who saw themselves as victims of the ""acts of god"" and not as active players in the prevention of future disasters. The only exception to this was found in Nova Mambone where environmental work is been carried out by the communities to prevent erosion. Chapter 11."

Rice farming in Odisha is pursued on its own , or as part of a mix of livelihood strategies under a range of owned land and share cropping arrangements .	Enhancing rice farming resilience to climate hazards is an important objective. The challenge is amplified by the magnitude of climate hazard exposure in deltas, and the concentrations of poor households who practice rice cultivation in deltas. It is likely that climate change will increase the intensity and occurrence of climate hazards (Mathison et al. 2013). Without understanding how to build the resilience of rice farming in deltas, it is difficult to create effective long-term management plans for agricultural development, and to assess the consequences of future climate change on rice production, and on farmer livelihoods. Here, to address this issue, we use primary field data from the Mahanadi Delta in India to assess what factors explain rice farmer resilience to climate hazards. 1uwa School of Agriculture and Environment, University of Western Australia, 2Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, UK, 3Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, UK., 4Wageningen School of Social Sciences (Wass), Wageningen University and Research Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ in the Mahanadi Delta the majority of farmers are smallholders excluded from local Economic Growth (Ministry of Agriculture 2014a). Odisha is one of India's poorest states with high levels of food insecurity (Pritchard et al. 2013, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation 2014). Rice farmers are exposed to frequent climate hazards, typically tropical cyclones and floods alongside a diverse range of environmental, social, political, and economic stresses (Chhotray and Few 2012, Das 2012, Chhotray et al. 2013), making it relatively typical of developing country deltas. Rice farming in Odisha is pursued on its own, or as part of a mix of livelihood strategies under a range of owned land and share cropping arrangements. This context enables assessment of how climate hazards interact with different rice farming livelihood strategies to determine resilience.

The preservation of the family name is guaranteed through the son(s). Except in a few countries (e.g. Ethiopia), a girl takes her husband's family name, dropping that of her own parents. The fear of losing a name prompts families to wish to have a son. Some men marry a second or a third wife to be sure of having a male child. Among many communities in Asia and Africa, sons perform burial rites for parents. Parents with no male child do not expect to have an appropriate burial to ""secure their peace in the next world"". In almost all religions, ceremonies are performed by men. Priests, pastors, sheikhs and other religious leaders are men of great status to whom society attaches great importance, and this important role for men obliges parents to wish for a male child.

These sectors include shipping , travel agencies , freight forwarding , mass communications , deep-sea fishing , timber industries , mining , and the cultivation and primary processing of certain agriculture commodities .	Sri Lanka maintains foreign investment restrictions in a wide range of sectors. For example, foreign investment is not permitted in certain types of money lending activities or in the coastal fishing sector. In other sectors, foreign investment is subject to case-by-case screening and approval when foreign equity exceeds 40 percent. These sectors include shipping, travel agencies, freight forwarding, mass communications, deep-sea fishing, timber industries, mining, and the cultivation and primary processing of certain agriculture commodities. Foreign equity restrictions also apply in the gem mining sector. The 2018 government budget proposed to lift restrictions on foreign ownership in shipping and freight forwarding sectors, but the government has yet to announce when it will implement this reform. As a general matter, Sri Lanka prohibits the sale of public and private land to foreign nationals and to enterprises with foreign equity exceeding 50 percent. However, on July 30, 2018, Sri Lanka amended the Land (Restriction of Alienation) Act of 2014 allowing foreign companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) to acquire and hold free hold land. The amendment also removed a prohibition on foreign nationals owning condominium property below the fourth floor. The amendments came into effect retrospectively from April 1, 2018. Foreign companies not listed on the CSE and engaged in banking, financial, insurance, maritime, aviation, advanced technology, or infrastructure development projects identified and approved as strategic development projects may be exempted from restrictions imposed by the Land Act of 2014 on a case-by-case basis. In 2011 the Sri Lankan government approved the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Assets Act, which allows for the nationalization of assets belonging to 37 private companies deemed by the Sri Lankan government to be underperforming and not meeting lease conditions. Although many of the companies were defunct, several were operating businesses, including one that was owned by a prominent member of the opposition. The Act has significantly increased investor uncertainty regarding property rights in Sri Lanka. The 2018 government budget proposed repealing the Act.

Additionally, no data is available as to whether the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains this authority. Similarly, some regulatory bodies maintain the sole authority to approve nursing schools or programs, including Brunei, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand. Others share such authority with their respective Ministries of Education, Qualification Agencies, or Higher Education Commissions, including Laos, Malaysia, and the Philippines by other branches of the government: the Ministry of Education in Vietnam. Information is not publicly available as to whether the Indonesian Ministry of Health maintains the authority to approve nursing schools or programs. Additionally, the responsibilities of all the Southeast Asian NRBs include administering nursing laws and regulations, licensing/registering nurses, and making decisions about scope of practice.

The private sector is the key engine of job creation , accounting for 90 percent of all jobs in the developing world .	Building on this framework, the Report tackles some of the most pressing questions policy makers are asking right now: Should countries design their development strategies around growth or focus on jobs? Are there situations where the focus should be on protecting jobs as opposed to protecting workers? Which needs to come first in the development process--creating jobs or building skills? The private sector is the key engine of job creation, accounting for 90 percent of all jobs in the developing world. But governments play a vital role by ensuring that the conditions are in place for strong private sector-led growth and by alleviating the constraints that hinder the private sector from creating good jobs for development.

LEARNING OUTCOMES AND THE HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX IN DCPS Strengthening learning is particularly important for improved human capital in DCPs. The average Human Capital Index (HCI) provided by the World Bank for DCPs illustrates that the expected productivity of a child born today as a future worker is only 41 percent of what it would be with full health and a full cycle of quality education to age 18.a The figure below shows that among the three dimensions of the HCI, the education component registers the lowest in DCPs. In other terms, the expected productivity of workers is low in DCPs mainly because of low achievements in learning-adjusted school years per child.

The World's Women 201534 Differences in causes of death over the life cycle between developing and developed regions remain prominent Changes in causes of death over the life cycle are similar for both women and men. Differences between developing and developed regions, however, are stark (figure 2.6). The first month of life is unique in the sense that most deaths at that age in both regions have roots in prenatal or genetic conditions. In developing regions, most child deaths after the first four weeks are due to communicable diseases (70 per cent). Over the life course, in developing regions, communicable diseases become less and less important as a cause of death; in people aged 70 and over, they account for 10 per cent of all deaths. As these diseases become less important, non-communicable diseases become more prominent. The latter are responsible for 11 per cent of deaths in children between 1 month and 5 years of age in developing regions, but 84 per cent of deaths among persons aged 70 and over. A different pattern emerges when injuries are the cause of death. Injuries are most common as a cause of death among adolescents and young adults.

When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.

Corruption remains a substantial barrier to doing business in Kenya. U.S. firms continue to report they find it difficult to succeed against competitors willing to ignore legal standards or engage in bribery and other forms of corruption. Corruption is widely reported to affect government procurement tender processes at both the national and county level. The government has not implemented anti-corruption laws effectively. U.S. firms routinely report direct requests for bribes from all levels of the Kenyan government. The Kenyan government began an anticorruption campaign using the Ethics and Anticorruption Commission (EACC) and Office of the Director of Public Prosecution to open cases against high profile offenders. While some cases brought to light by the EACC have resulted in convictions, no high-profile cases have ended in conviction. Despite efforts to increase efficiency and public confidence in the judiciary, a backlog of cases and continuing corruption - both perceived and real - reduce the credibility and effectiveness of Kenya's judicial system. While judicial reforms are moving forward, bribes, extortion, and political considerations continue to influence outcomes in court cases. An Employment and Labor Relations Court exists in Kenya, but it is plagued by long delays in rendering judgments. As such, foreign and local investors risk lengthy and costly legal procedures.

Those earnings and benefits--tangible or otherwise--are the first and most direct measure of the value a job has to society. But jobs may also affect others, positively or negatively. Jobs for women may influence resource allocations at the household level and benefit their children.

When the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) adopted GPE 2020, its strategy for 2016-2020, partners chose to tackle the learning crisis head-on by focusing on education quality and equity. This Results Report 2019, the third for the current strategy, shows that GPE is making important headway toward improving learning for all children. More children are entering and completing school across partner countries, and there is encouraging progress in learning. Partners are working together to build a strong and sustainable foundation for learning, with improvements in sector planning and increased investments in data and learning assessment systems. Going forward, to be transformative these efforts need to be bolstered by consistent and inclusive monitoring of progress, as well as increased and better use of existing national systems. Inequity is a global challenge that goes beyond our sector and requires significant attention. Education gaps based on wealth and geographic location are still wide but narrowing, while the gap between girls and boys remains steady. This report provides valuable insight into where partners must focus resources to go that extra mile to make sure education systems meet the needs of the most marginalized children and break down the barriers keeping them out of school or not learning. Focusing on those left furthest behind is not just the right thing to do, but also the best way to improve overall learning outcomes and reduce inefficiency.

We have also sought to address this issue through the PwC ESCAPE Index20, which was first launched in February 2014 and has since been updated for this report. This aims to provide a holistic view of the performance of 42 of the largest advanced and emerging economies since 2000. The index combines 20 key indicators across five dimensions: 1. Economic growth and stability; 2. Social progress and cohesion; 3. Communications Technology; 4. Political, legal and regulatory institutions; and 5. Environmental sustainability. 19 PwC's Country Risk Premium (CRP) analysis covers 187 sovereign nations using an economic model that PwC have developed since 1998. PwC's model uses a range of inputs in generating CRPs, including reliable sources of credit and risk ratings and sovereign bond information. The CRPs are updated on a quarterly basis.

"Argentina remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2018 Special 301 Report. The situation for innovators in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors presents significant challenges. First, the scope of patentable subject matter is significantly restricted under Argentine law. Second, there is not adequate protection against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test and other data submitted to the government in conjunction with its lengthy marketing approval process. Finally, the patent pendency backlog continues to be excessive. In addition, the absence of sustained enforcement efforts - including under the criminal laws - sufficient to have a deterrent effect, coupled with judicial inefficiency and outdated intellectual property (IP) laws, diminishes the competitiveness of U.S. IP-intensive industries in Argentina. During 2018, Argentina made progress in tackling the problem of street vendors selling counterfeit products within the City of Buenos Aires. Authorities continue to take action, including seizures of illicit goods, to dismantle organized crime operations in ""La Salada"", one of South America's largest black markets for counterfeit and pirated goods. The existing legislative regime and lack of enforcement hinder the ability of rights holders, law enforcement, and prosecutors to halt, through legal action, the growth of illegal online markets.

"Understanding the links between environmental change and migration The mechanisms through which environmental impacts contribute to migration are complex.4 Over the last decade, it has become accepted that links between the environment and migration are rarely linear. Some literature frames the issue as a normal and neutral social process and other articles refer to the ""migrancy problematic"".5 Economic, political, cultural and demographic factors interact with environmental drivers to shape intentions of people to move or stay in a given location.

While policy circles may embrace such estimates, academia has been critical of the assumptions necessary to produce models, in particular the lack of consideration given to non-migratory adaptation measures (Gemenne, 2011).

It represents the ability of the biosphere to produce crops , livestock ( pasture ) , timber products ( forest ) , and fish , as well as to uptake carbon dioxide in forests .	"Biocapacity Assessment A national biocapacity calculation starts with the total amount of bioproductive land available. ""Bioproductive"" refers to land and water that supports significant photosynthetic activity and accumulation of biomass, ignoring barren areas of low, dispersed productivity. This is not to say that areas such as the Sahara Desert, Antarctica, or Alpine mountaintops do not support life; their production is simply too widespread to be directly harvestable by humans. Biocapacity is an aggregated measure of the amount of land available, weighted by the productivity of that land. It represents the ability of the biosphere to produce crops, livestock (pasture), timber products (forest), and fish, as well as to uptake carbon dioxide in forests. It also includes how much of this regenerative capacity is occupied by infrastructure (built-up land). In short, it measures the ability of available terrestrial and aquatic areas to provide ecological services. A country's biocapacity for any land use type is calculated as EQFYFABC ..= where BC is the biocapacity, A is the area available for a given land use type, and YF and EQF are the yield factor and equivalence factor, respectively, for the country land use type in question. The yield factor is the ratio of national to world average yields. It is calculated as the annual availability of usable products and varies by country and year. Equivalence factors translate the area supplied or demanded of a specific land use type (e.g. world average cropland, grazing land, etc.) into units of world average biologically productive area (global hectares) and varies by land use type and year. 13 ."

In Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, Eswatini, Uganda, and Zambia, those serving on the regulatory body are appointed by the government, while in Botswana and Madagascar, the regulatory body is elected. In the remaining countries, the regulatory body consists of a combination of elected and appointed members, or, in the case of six countries, include ex-officio members. Data related to the composition of the regulatory body were available for 36 African countries. Twenty-five of these have nurses serving on their regulatory bodies. Of those 11 that do not include nurses on their NRBs, 9 are in countries where the Ministry of Health oversees nursing regulation, and the NRB is comprised of public servants who may not belong to a health profession. In Morocco and Tunisia, the NRB includes physicians, but information is not available on who else serves. Physicians also serve alongside nurses in 9 additional African NRBs.

Ethiopia has the most stipulations, specifying that those serving must be of good moral character and mental health, with no addictions or criminal history. Gambia requires each region be equally represented and the involvement of the professional association.

So much has happened in the sphere of global migration governance in the two years since the publication of the World Migration Report 2018 that the editors felt it important to have an update on the topic for readers of the World Migration Report 2020. This chapter provides a descriptive analysis that is specific to a point in time10 - the implementation and evolution of the system will continue well into the future. In picking up from where the World Migration Report 2018 left off, the next section walks through the development and adoption of the two global compacts. The third section offers a brief analysis of the complementarity, coherence and gaps between the two global compacts. The fourth section outlines an assessment of how the global compacts affect global migration governance architecture. The final section then looks to the future by outlining the implications of these recent developments as well as the challenges for implementation of the global compacts. The chapter builds on information from the policy sphere, academic commentaries and opinion pieces.

Supporting women and women's organizations in ways that bring in women's rights-based and feminist approaches--and holistic programming as opposed or in addition to more service delivery efforts--can lead to more gender-transformative humanitarian action. Gendertransformative action seeks to change unequal gender power dynamics, particularly through policy change, and is led by women's organizations. In Bangladesh, for example, the Bangladesh National Woman Lawyers Association provides legal aid services to forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals in Cox's Bazar while also advocating for the adoption of sexual harassment guidelines nationally.

This leveraged funding by foreign investors, under the obligation for the new VC funds to invest in start-up companies in Israel. Over a period of three years, the Group established ten hybrid public/private funds, each capitalised with around USD 20 million. In parallel, YOZMA started making direct investments in start-up companies. A five-year option was given to private partners to buy out the Government's share at predetermined conditions. This option was exercised in most cases, leading to the privatization of the VC funds. Initial individual investments typically ranged between USD 1 million and USD 6 million, and additional capital was reserved for follow-on investments. With the backing of prominent American, European and Israeli investors, YOZMA launched its second fund in 1995. Investment decisions regarding where and how to invest were mainly taken by the international partners.

Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities .	Several policy entry points can be considered to maximize agriculture's contribution to the jobs agenda in Coted'Ivoire. First, continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Second, smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation, in particular as there are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones. There is substantial scope for modernization to take place in smallholder agriculture, including through mechanization. Third, Coted'Ivoire would need strong additional investments in agricultural research and development, including on staple crops. Fourth, low educational levels and poor training among actors in agricultural value chains hold technological innovation back. Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities. Finally, improving rural land tenure security and overcoming financing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses. This will often require a more integrated value chain approach where the government can play an important coordinating role.

Australia requires completion of a complex approval process before it will permit the importation of bovine products from a country that has reported any indigenous cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Under Australia's requirements, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) conducts an individual country risk analysis. In 2017, FSANZ issued its final report for the United States, which determined that U.S. beef imports are safe for human consumption, and recommended Category 1 status be afforded to U.S. beef under Australia's import requirements. The findings also confirmed that U.S. beef meets the negligible BSE risk requirements of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Following Australia's report, U.S. and Australian officials completed negotiation of the final requirements for heattreated, shelf-stable U.S. beef products and opened Australia's market to these products in May 2018, after a 14-year ban. For fresh (chilled or frozen) beef and beef products, the Australian government, in December 2015, began the review of its import requirements for three countries that applied for export to Australia: the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. This review, which concluded in August 2017, considered fresh (chilled or frozen) beef and beef products such as: meat, bone, and offal of cattle; buffalo; and bison.

Low-skill jobs in industrial countries are often high-skill jobs from the perspective of developing countries , and exporting itself is a skill-intensive activity .	Admittedly, the dispersion of earnings within countries has also increased, for instance in the form of higher returns to education, and it is tempting to attribute this trend to globalization. Low-skill jobs in industrial countries are often high-skill jobs from the perspective of developing countries, and exporting itself is a skill-intensive activity. Therefore, international trade and offshore outsourcing can be expected to increase the relative demand for skills at both ends, favoring better-off workers. The empirical results on this possible effect vary widely, however.66 For sure, all policies create winners and losers, and the distribution of labor earnings has widened in parallel with globalization, but a causal relationship is difficult to establish. Overall, widening disparities may have more to do with technological progress and financial liberalization than with globalization.

"ChaPTER i. ThE hEalTh aNd wElfaRE of maNkINd 5 27. One of the most serious challenges includes the loss of state control to organized criminal groups. Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State, as well as the regional and global community. When state structures become involved with and affected by violence and systemic corruption, drug trafficking can further weaken the efficacy of Governments to the point of creating ""failed State"" conditions at the national or subregional level. Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid. 28. One of the most recent challenges to the international drug control system is that posed by the use of the Internet for drug trafficking. States must do more to enable the investigation of such illegal operations in order to ensure that such operations are identified, restricted and eliminated and that the international postal system is not used for illicit drug shipments. Internet pharmacies and other dispensing methods that physically separate the prescriber or provider from the patient pose a particular risk and require the development of more effective regulatory approaches. In such systems of supply, it is more difficult for prescribers and dispensers to evaluate the needs of patients to ensure that the prescriptions will be used for legitimate medical purposes so as to protect the health and well-being of the individual. States should be mindful of the challenges that such methods for the supply of medications may pose."

The demands of transplanting and manual weeding and increasing shortages of labor have encouraged the move to direct seeding in irrigated and rainfed lowlands .	The demands of transplanting and manual weeding and increasing shortages of labor have encouraged the move to direct seeding in irrigated and rainfed lowlands. Weeds become a major problem in these systems because rice and weeds emerge at the same time, and weed control by flooding is difficult in seeded rice. Herbicides are being used more to control weeds, and herbicide-resistant weeds and pollution are emerging problems in direct-seeded systems. 26 Rice almanac Insects attack all parts of the rice plant. Hundreds of species feed on rice, but only a few cause yield loss. The most important and widely distributed pest species are stem borers, leaffolders, planthoppers, and gall midge. Stem borers are chronic pests, found in every field in every season, but generally at low levels. Planthoppers and gall midge usually create localized outbreaks, causing high yield losses in relatively small areas. Biological control by natural enemies plays a critical role in the management of all insect pests. Resistant rice varieties are of importance in the control of planthoppers and gall midge. No strong sources of resistance to stem borers have been found in rice germplasm, although modern semidwarf rice varieties generally have lower levels of stem borer damage than the traditional varieties they replaced. Insecticides are used extensively against planthoppers in temperate areas of Asia, where mass immigration of planthoppers from tropical areas is a frequent problem.	The demands of transplanting and manual weeding and increasing shortages of labor have encouraged the move to direct seeding in irrigated and rainfed lowlands.

Are there special considerations to take into account when applying the 2008 Guidelines to marine protected areas? New supplementary guidance for applying the categories to marine protected areas was published in 2012 (Day et al., 2012). The supplementary marine guidelines build on the 2008 Guidelines but interpret them in the marine context. The major innovation is a discussion of activities suitable in the different management categories--for example, fishing (recreational, traditional and commercial) is an issue particularly focused upon. For instance, a discussion of catch and release fishing is included, noting that many fish are injured and subsequently die as a result of this type of fishing, so the activity is not considered appropriate in a category II protected area. IUCN WCPA Best Practice Guidance on Recognising Protected Areas and Assigning Management Categories and Governance Types Issue Comment/resource How is the assignment process affected by transboundary protected areas? Transboundary protected areas are discussed in the 2008 Guidelines (page 37). In short, internationally adjoining protected areas can have a different category or governance assignment if their management or governance differs.

Summary of Country Gender Profile in Cote d'Ivoire (2013) General Situation of Women  Following the end of the long political crisis in 2011, Cote d'Ivoire is making efforts toward to restoration. However, because of long turmoil of the crisis, statistical data is insufficient, and the development of statistics and a population registration system are pressing issues.  In Cote d'Ivoire, there are various ethnic groups, each with a different language, culture and customs. The social status of women varies in each ethnic group. Generally, the social and economic status of women is low, and they have inadequate access to basic social services and less economic power compared to men. Government Policy  The government of Cote d'Ivoire has adopted policies and action plans to promote gender equality. It is important to assure the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these actions.  The strategy for the fight against gender based violence (GBV) was established in 2012, and it is now in the implementation phase of the action plan.  A project to develop a database of talented women is ongoing under the initiative of the Presidential Office as a way to evaluate and utilize the capacities and talents of women across the country. National Machinery  In 1976, the Ministry for Condition of Woman (Ministere de la Condition de la Femme) was established. Since then, the ministry has been in charge of promoting gender equality. However, the budget has not been sufficiently allocated. Therefore, the allocation of an adequate budget and the establishment of administrative capacity are required.  Gender Groups have not been established in all ministries. Sufficient budget allocation and human resources are challenges for the Gender Groups.

As for the field of science , in 6 out of 10 countries with data , the percentage of men graduating in this field was at least twice that of women .	Women are less likely than men to graduate in fields related to science and engineering Despite enjoying better access to tertiary education than ever before, women continue to face challenges in participating in some fields of study traditionally dominated by men. Women are less likely than men to graduate in science, engineering, manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and services. This is particularly so in the case of engineering and to a lesser extent science among countries with data for the period 2005-2012 (figure 3.12). Among men graduates, on average, one in five graduated in engineering compared to one out of 20 women graduates, and one in nine men graduated in science compared to one in 14 women. In all countries with data, with the exception of Cyprus (where 16 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women graduated in engineering) and Myanmar (4 per cent of men and women), men were at least twice as likely to graduate in engineering as women. In a third of these countries, representing different regions, the percentage of men graduating in this field was at least 5 times higher than that of women.

Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school. The project program implies long-term comprehensive training, which is designed for a period of up to 9 years and can take place in parallel with the basic educa1on and in addi1on to it; 4. Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project. The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy. The total number of employees and developers is about 100 people; 5. Constant adjustment and upda1ng of the training program through the introduc1on of modern educa1onal modules, relevant training plaKorms, as well as interes1ng and non-standard tasks and projects for selfimplementa1on;6. Sources of stable financial flows: The volume of financial revenues of the company is formed through three permanent channels: training in its own divisions, the implementa1on of franchises (lump-sum contribu1ons), and regular payments by exis1ng franchisees (royal1es); 7. The possibility of replica1on of the project in any locality (popula1on size does not maher);8. The project's target audience is children and adolescents aged 6-14 (children at this age are especially suscep1ble to new knowledge, are interested in modern technologies, and ac1vely use gadgets, but use them mainly for entertainment) and their parents (they care about quality educa1on of their children, and precisely at the age of 6-14 invest the core capital in their development).

Fifth, the dietary transformation following income growth and urbanization also opens up new demand for agricultural products and employment on, and increasingly also, offthe farm in the value chains. As countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases. After Engel's Law, this is the second large Law of Demand, named after Bennett. This also opens up new jobs opportunities, directly in the production of these products (dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables), and indirectly in the associated chains (storage, transport, processing, packaging, wholesale, and retail). The production of high-value agricultural products tends to be more labor intensive (see also Figure3.6), while jobs in the agricultural value chain (especially in agro-processing) are often taken up by women (Table 2.2).

Thailand has sponsored a well-organized International Peanut Conference in January 2005 in Bangkok, with Peanut CRSP. This international event was carried out successfully and was participated by about 150 peanut scientists and researchers and their partners from the U.S., Thailand, and other countries participating in Peanut CRSP, like Bulgaria, Philippines, etc. The Industry Incubator Model that was developed in the Philippines could be transferred to Thailand to expand the commercialization of peanut products from village-level micro-and small-scale enterprises to medium-to large-scale food industry companies. Training of managers, factory workers, and other business groups is an important activity. The Ministry of Industry is providing funds to Kasetsart University, through its Small-and Medium-Enterprise Funds, to train private companies. Thailand has been developed as a center for excellence in training of trainers and technology transfer and should continue this training project in the host country.

Part 2 Ecological accounting under the glass dome. Only sunlight has access to the futuristic city. With the sunshine a certain amount of energy enters - which is all there is to power the city. Though hypothetical, this approach somewhat reflects that of the Footprint. How large must the glass dome be - how much farm land, how many forests and other areas must it encompass for the city to be viable? Of course one can't simply imagine each city in isolation. The areas from which urban centers import their resources are distributed across large parts of the world, and, in times of globalization, cities compete for the global supply of natural capital. A city which provides a comparable quality of life with a smaller per capita Footprint is also less dependent upon imports, and therefore more competitive. If today the majority of people live in cities, then that is exactly where the future of civilization will be decided. The Footprint helps in adjusting infrastructure and urban planning for the future. Take traffic for example. As complex as discussions are about transportation and infrastructure, the Footprint can reduce the information to a single number each time: the required area. This is crucial when making investment decisions, be it for building roads, tracks, bridges, harbors or entire settlements. Infrastructure and planning decisions will shape the way residents live for years to come; the Footprint can help decision-makers balance the needs of citizens with a growing concern about the city's use of natural resources.

The second aspect related to migration and health is on how migration can affect the health of populations (public health). As outlined above, migrants can face challenges in addressing their mental, social and physical well-being needs. Migrants who have limited or no ability to access positive determinants of health (see figure 1) can experience poor health outcomes, with various consequences for public health. This situation could itself be the result of difficulties faced in accessing a secure income, perhaps associated with challenges involved in obtaining the necessary documentation to work legally. Should they be unable to access timely testing and treatment, chances for onward transmission of the disease to others within the community would increase, as would the likelihood of unnecessary costs being incurred by the host healthcare system as a result. It is important to recognize that popular representations of migration and health tend to be exaggerated by the media, sometimes as part of anti-immigrant political agendas, in which migration is positioned as a threat to public health.

The agricultural sector, including livestock and fisheries, accounts for 53% of the country's GDP.

Rice production employs 40% of the total labor force and consumes 70% of total commercial fertilizers. Rice maintains its position as the main staple food crop, accounting for 97% of total food grain production. The importance of rice as a major foreign exchange earner, however, has declined over time. Before World War II, Myanmar was the largest riceexporting country in the world. However, because of stagnation of production since the early 1960s, Thailand took the place of Myanmar in the export market, as exports declined from 1.7 million t in 1962 to 0.3 million t in 1975. Annual exports had fluctuated from 0.5 to 0.9 million t during 1976- 86, a period of respectable growth in rice production. Exports in recent years have fallen below 100,000 t. Myanmar has the capacity to substantially increase rice exports, but it is constrained by poor grain quality, inadequate processing and marketing infrastructure, and an underdeveloped trading system.

Given the local dimension of angel investing , in some countries , such as the US and Canada , support is provided at the local level rather than at the national level .	Policies 405. Angel investing is increasingly encouraged and supported by policy makers in many countries, as a way to mobilize financial resources and entrepreneurial expertise towards dynamic new ventures. In most cases, supply-side measures have been introduced, which mainly take the form of tax incentives and public co-investment. Given the local dimension of angel investing, in some countries, such as the US and Canada, support is provided at the local level rather than at the national level. 47 see www.eban.org 406. Front-end and back-end tax incentives aim to increase the number of BAs as well as the amount of capital invested. Typically, incentives are conditional on the shares being held for a minimum number of years or the capital gains being reinvested in new ventures. For instance, in 2008, Italy introduced tax relief for business angel investments, which consists of a tax exemption for capital gains on the sale of a startups' undertakings, provided that the start-up is less than seven years old, that the investor holds the shares for at least three years, and that the capital gains are reinvested in another start-up in the next two years (OECD, 2014b). 407. Japan has introduced an angel tax system since 1997, which comprises reduced taxation on capital gains and carry forward of losses. However, as angel taxation was only used for a small amount of investments, to further increase angel funding, the system was amended in recent years with the introduction of an income exemption system, whereby, under specific conditions, BAs can deduct from their annual income an amount of money substantially equivalent to the investment carried out in the same year (OECD, 2011a). 408. Another common supply-side measure consists in the creation of co-investment funds, which match public funds with those of private investors that are approved under the scheme. In some cases these funds target all seed and early stage investors, including also VC funds (see Box 9), but there exists also programmes that are especially focused on BAs. In the UK, the Angel CoFund invests amounts of GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million into SMEs with high growth potential, working in partnership with syndicates of experienced BAs.

For invasions in natural environments , the goals will ideally include the preservation or restoration of that environment ; the control of a IAS is only the first step in this process .	An assessment of the status and trends of bioinvasion in a given area is fundamental first step in the development of a national plan for dealing with IAS issues. The Plan itself should include a strategy to build institutional support and engage all important stakeholders in the effort, particularly local communities. This national strategy will be needed to make a national commitment operational. Goals and objectives for a national plan need to shared across sectors and the strategy needs to be integrated into larger national plans for conservation and agricultural development. For invasions in natural environments, the goals will ideally include the preservation or restoration of that environment; the control of a IAS is only the first step in this process. Existing legal and institutional frameworks also need to assessed and reviewed as these are key to the sustainability of any national effort to address the problems. There is also need to have concerted bilateral, regional and sometimes global actions based on common objectives. Finally, basic biological knowledge (e.g. taxonomy) must be combined with evolving technologies and tools for management. These tools rely heavily on the existence of reliable and taxonomically comprehensive data. Broadly speaking, any national plan should comprehensively address the four categories of tools and processes for IAS management: prevention, early detection, eradication, and control. The following section provides a brief summary of these issues. Detailed descriptions and case studies for the examples mentioned below can be found in the Toolkit.

Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important , long-term achievement of the recovery interventions .	Remarkably few evaluations have been done of the recovery period, so it is not possible to make a definitive judgment on the effectiveness and impact of the recovery processes after the 2000 floods. However, Mozambique's recovery from the 2000 floods broadly appears to have been effective and generally well handled. The 2000 floods in Mozambique demonstrated clearly that it is possible to make an impact and carry out extensive recovery activities when the disaster is high profile and the amount of money donated to the affected populations is large. Recovery programs provided an opportunity for investments in upgraded services and infrastructure. Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted, albeit somewhat passively, to resume their livelihoods. On the negative side, asset depletion has been neglected in the post-emergency period. Increased social capital was the most important positive aspect for affected populations. There are indications that some of the new social structures created - associations, community committees and resettlement areas - will strengthen the safety net for future disasters, but it is too early to state categorically that this will be a lasting effect of the post-emergency interventions. Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important, long-term achievement of the recovery interventions. The importance of infrastructure construction and rehabilitation should not be underestimated when preparing contingency plans and developing a set of interventions to be considered post-emergency. In terms of Mozambique's development of its disaster preparedness and mitigation plan, much will depend on the level of commitment given to it by the government and by donors. The importance of this area is shown when a devastating disaster (of the kind experienced in 2000) occurs, but institutional memories can be short and other priorities may dominate, particularly in economic and political areas. It is also a question of whether disaster management issues can be maintained as priorities when government budgets are likely to be under increasing pressure. xiii .	Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important, long-term achievement of the recovery interventions.

Geodiversity has also had a profound influence on many aspects of cultural landscapes , built environments and economic activities .	Geodiversity provides the foundations for life on Earth and for the diversity of natural habitats and landscapes. Many individual geological features and landforms have cultural or iconic values for humans, which influence the way that we view surrounding natural or semi-natural habitats. Geodiversity has also had a profound influence on many aspects of cultural landscapes, built environments and economic activities. Protection of geodiversity can be in response to a range of interests, including those associated with important fossil sites; reference sites for geoscience; spectacular features linked with tourism; and landforms that have particular cultural or spiritual values. Geodiversity can contribute to sustainable economic development through tourism associated with geological features. Understanding the functional links between geodiversity and biodiversity is particularly important for conservation management in dynamic environments, where natural processes (e.g., floods, erosion and deposition) maintain habitat diversity and ecological functions. This is explicit in the Ecosystem Approach and is fundamental at a time when many ecosystems face the impacts of climate change. Geodiversity is therefore a key Table 13.

The years of crisis affected the quality of education services and their ability to instill in children the skills they need to be productive in the labor force. As Chapter5 highlighted, although wages are not necessarily very high in the formal sector, low worker productivity likely contributes to push up relative labor costs and may constrain expansion of formal firms. At the same time, and as mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4, education and skills also matter for productivity in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment, in particular to ensure that individuals are able to seize opportunities such as improved technologies or business practices.

Less than 6% of sampled households sold more than 50% of their rice in private markets (Table 1), indicating that rice cropping generates little or no financial return for the majority of rice farmers. This lack of cash income restricts the ability of rice farmers to purchase food in markets or to invest in rice cropping to improve productivity or output, i.e., buy more land, change to more productive/less vulnerable plots, or hire more labor. Households often sell rice to meet short-term household costs. This is distinctly different from a commercially orientated strategy of generating surpluses to sell and generate income. One rice farmer commented that he does not sell after harvest, but if he needs something later he will sell his rice because it is nearly impossible to save (SSI:12)[4][5]. Another farmer noted that they do not sell rice to markets unless they are really desperate (SSI:17).

CHAPTER 3 Productivity growth happens as jobs become more productive, as new highproductivity jobs are created, and as lowproductivity jobs disappear. In the medium term, trends in employment align closely with trends in the labor force, so there is no such a thing as jobless growth. But the short-term relationship between employment and growth is more complex. Large numbers of jobs are being created and destroyed simultaneously, leading to structural change and spatial labor reallocation. Underneath these sectoral and spatial changes are firm dynamics that result in a constant restructuring and reallocation of resources, including labor.

As the area under cultivation declines relative to the size of the population , producing sufficient food becomes a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place .	Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries, because poor people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.8 Since 1700, virtually every example of mass poverty reduction has actually begun with an increase in agricultural productivity.9 Constraints on agricultural growth vary depending on the availability of land relative to the availability of farm labor. Compared with other areas of the developing world, SubSaharan Africa was traditionally seen as a continent of ample land and scarce labor. While that may still be true in some areas, it no longer applies to countries in the south and east of the continent. In Mozambique, the average farm size is less than 1.5 hectares. As the area under cultivation declines relative to the size of the population, producing sufficient food becomes a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place. In many agrarian economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have yet to occur. Unlike many parts of Asia, where the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield and the poverty incidence has declined, cereal yield has remained low and poverty incidence high in these Sub-Saharan countries (figure 6.1). Some Asian economies, such as Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar, face similar challenges.

Substitution of up to 40% roasted defatted peanut flour yielded snacks that was most acceptable to consumers. U.S. and West African sensory panels tested both snacks; the West African panel gave higher acceptability ratings to peanut-based snacks especially chin-chin compared to the U.S. panel. Shelf-life of chin-chin was determined to be good. The high protein-low fat products have health implications. Peanut milk from defatted peanut flour is being developed in Senegal by collaborating researchers for testing for acceptance by Senegalese consumers. Assessment of the level of aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products in Senegal, through sampling, was carried out. The results provided baseline on health risks to consumers and provide guidance on ways to reduce aflatoxin especially at the village/small-scale processor level. Aflatoxin detoxification: B1 and G1 Aflatoxin detoxification of peanut products using Senegalese Attapulgite clay was tested in Senegal in collaboration with NCA&T researchers. Addition of clay as low as 0.5% level resulted to non-detectable levels of aflatoxin in all samples. Samples of all peanut products in local markets in Senegal showed aflatoxin contamination; the products showing high levels of over 30% were: crude peanut oil (92%), peanut cake (90%), and peanut paste (55%), and kernels in local market (30%). Sorting and removal of skins proved effective in lowering aflatoxin for some uses, and the utilization of the Senegalese attapulgite clay reduced aflatoxin to none detectable levels in other uses of peanut.

In all three subjects tested - - reading , mathematics and science - - the differences between the lowest-and the highest-performing students within the countries were large and the inequality in learning achievement across population groups was closely related to wealth distribution .	Results from a PISA surveya conducted in 2012 in 34 OECD member States and 31 other countries and areas showed large gaps in learning achievement among countries. In general, low-income countries lag far behind high-income countries in learning achievement. Also, there is less variation among OECD countries than among non-OECD countries. Furthermore, differences among countries represent only a fraction of the overall variation in student performance. In all three subjects tested--reading, mathematics and science--the differences between the lowest-and the highest-performing students within the countries were large and the inequality in learning achievement across population groups was closely related to wealth distribution. Gender differences in educational performance were considerably less prominent than differences between the countries and within countries in educational performance.b Nevertheless, existing gaps underscore the importance of a gender-sensitive approach in teaching.

Ethiopia's investment code prohibits foreign investment in the financial service industry, including banking and insurance. Foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin who own bank shares, even if purchased while they were Ethiopian citizens, have been required to surrender their shares at par value. The banking sector is composed of 16 private commercial banks and two public banks. Financial transactions are predominately in cash. Ethiopia's Automatic Teller Machine network has expanded rapidly and has become accessible to customers of all banks and credit card holders, though there are frequent service interruptions due to the unreliable Internet network. In addition, agent-banking services tied to mobile phones have been introduced by several providers, and more than a million users of agent-banking services are registered. Few international banks maintain representative offices, and all trade financing must go through an Ethiopian bank. This creates significant challenges for foreign investors with offshore accounts. Following the 15 percent devaluation of the Ethiopian birr in 2017, NBE increased the minimum saving interest rate from five to seven percent, and limited the outstanding loan growth rate in commercial banks to 16.5 percent above the previous year. This has had the effect of limiting lending to business other than the export and manufacturing sectors. Moreover, banks are instructed to immediately transfer 30 percent of their foreign exchange inflow to an NBE account for local currency conversion. This hard currency is then used by the government to meet the strategic needs of the country, such as payments made to procure petroleum, fertilizers, or pharmaceuticals. 164 | foreign trade barriers .

Focusing solely on the relationship between growth and employment may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender equality , support urbanization , or contribute Growth strategies or jobs strategies ?	When a growth strategy may not be sufficient Focusing on the aggregate relationship between growth and employment downplays some of the most important channels through which jobs connect to development. The very notion of employment as derived labor demand does not reflect the situation of the many working people in developing countries who are farmers and self-employed. The focus on the labor market as the transmission chain between growth and employment also does not capture the interaction of working people with others in households, at the workplace, and in society more broadly. Focusing solely on the relationship between growth and employment may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender equality, support urbanization, or contribute Growth strategies or jobs strategies? 88 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 In practice, however, tradeoffs between the three transformations can amount to more than just lags and gaps. Depending on the nature of the jobs challenges facing a country, tensions may emerge between growth that generates jobs for living standards and growth that generates jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion. Examples abound: * In agrarian economies, increasing productivity in smallholder farming is fundamental for poverty reduction, given the share of the population living in rural areas. But urban jobs in activities that connect the economy to world markets and global value chains are necessary for growth. With limited resources to support both, a tradeoff between living standards and productivity may arise. * In resource-rich countries, massive investments in extractive industries support accel- to peaceful collective decision making. Understanding how to enhance these positive spillovers from jobs might be difficult when only aggregates are considered.

In addition , their safety may be compromised by a combination of high-risk environments and a lack of PPE ( WEF , 2020 ) .	Effective response requires a strong, committed, well-distributed, and skilled workforce that is supported, protected, recognised, and encouraged, particularly given the emotional strain during emergencies. Support is particularly important for female health workers, who make up an estimated 70% of the world's global health and social sector workforce (WEF, 2020). Many often have to balance increased family pressures as well as the increased workload related to pandemic response (O'Donnell et al., 2020). In addition, their safety may be compromised by a combination of high-risk environments and a lack of PPE (WEF, 2020). For COVID-19, requirements include provision for surge capacity, adjusting roles and actions as needed, and ongoing capacity building. Countries also need to be aware of the differentiated needs of female and male health workers and ensure they are motivated and supported through occupational health programmes, remuneration, insurance, childcare if needed, and psychosocial support. This can promote the institutional trust that is crucial to the performance of the health system. (c) Maintains 90 The next sections explore the extent to which Maintains countries have been able to respond to the following factors: * Human resource provisions are in place to provide surge capacity, and to adjust roles and actions as needed, assisted by ongoing capacity building; and * Health workers are motivated and supported by occupational health programmes, training, remuneration and insurance, and psychosocial support, leading to high levels of interpersonal trust; the differentiated needs of women and men are taken into account.

A comprehensive agricultural finance diagnostic is called for. Successful development offinancial services will , among others , require a supportive legal and regulatory framework that enables the enforcement of legal contracts in the agricultural sector .	Overcome the financing gap. As highlighted in the rice value chain study, the ability of farmers and agribusinesses to invest is importantly determined by their access to financial services. Initiatives to expand access to finance in rural areas have as yet proven unsuccessful. Even microfinancial institutions (MFIs) devote only 5 percent of their portfolio to financing agriculture. As a result, only an estimated 14 percent of the rural population have access to formal financial services. A comprehensive agricultural finance diagnostic is called for. Successful development offinancial services will, among others, require a supportive legal and regulatory framework that enables the enforcement of legal contracts in the agricultural sector. Market-friendly government support mechanisms (such as partial credit guarantee schemes and public-private partnerships to encourage the development of agricultural insurance) will also be needed. 71 The training model followed by the Songhai agricultural training center in Porto Novo, Benin provides just one such example. It is locally owned and privately managed. Instruction favors application, with more than 75 percent of time devoted to practical subjects. Innovations in the training include creation of a business center of agricultural products and a credit program to help trainees establish themselves after training. About 20 percent of the trainees are women and 60 percent come from rural areas. Sixty-five to seventy percent of its graduates settle in agriculture. Other African institutes which successfully adapted their AET programs include Makerere in Uganda, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, as well as institutes in Mauritius.

The process of improving a business environment often spans several years .	Does training civil servants and communicating regulatory changes affect the business climate? Reform efforts will not always result in immediate improvements; indeed, some may have no impact at all. Efficient design and poor implementation are just two factors that explain why some reforms succeed while others fail. Once new regulation is enacted, it must be brought to practice--the role of dissemination should not be underestimated. The process of improving a business environment often spans several years. Naturally, every case is unique and a variety of factors influence each economic environment; business regulation is only one of those factors. Political stability, the level of economic development, natural resource endowment, cultural specifics, environmental risk and many other elements can each play a consequential role in the ability of an economy to implement regulatory change successfully. While some factors cannot be influenced, others lie within governments' direct control, for example the level of training provided to civil servants and the way in which regulatory change is communicated.

The Reseau Ouest et Centre Africain du Riz (ROCARIZ), a Rice Research and Development Network for West and Central Africa, was created in 2000 after in-depth consultations among WARDA, the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (WECARD/CORAF), national research systems, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). ROCARIZ is a successor network to the highly successful WARDA/NARS Rice Task Force Collaborative Mechanism for rice research and development within the subregion, which was supported financially by USAID in 1991-97. ROCARIZ maintains the task force structure with seven functional task forces on mangrove swamps, rice breeding, Sahel resource management, integrated pest management, natural resource management, rice economics, and technology transfer. ROCARIZ finances small two-year research projects through national scientists in member countries. The technology transfer task force includes the active participation of researchers, extension officers, and end-users of research results. ROCARIZ has established a forum--the Biennial Regional Rice Research Review (4Rs)--for reporting and publishing rice research and development activities within the subregion. The principal stakeholders of ROCARIZ are WARDA, CORAF member countries, national research systems, USAID, the private sector, and rice farmers. ROCARIZ values its guiding principles of trust, mutual respect, and joint ownership--essential ingredients for a successful partnership program. ROCARIZ is coordinated at WARDA headquarters and is managed by a coordinator under the guidance of a steering committee composed of national scientists, the private sector, development agents, and a WARDA representative.

See the country tables for the scores for each Doing Business topic for all economies .	Doing Business does not attempt to quantify all costs and benefits of a particular law or regulation to society as a whole. The paying taxes indicators measure the total tax and contribution rate, which, in isolation, is a cost to businesses. However, the indicators do not measure--nor are they intended to measure--the benefits of the social and economic programs funded with tax revenues. Measuring the quality and efficiency of business regulation provides only one input into the debate on the regulatory burden associated with achieving regulatory objectives, which can differ across economies. Doing Business provides a starting point for this discussion and should be used in conjunction with additional data sources.

While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging , it lags behind primary education .	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.

The other question in the time use domain asks about subjective satisfaction with leisure; however, in the pilot studies in Bangladesh and Guatemala, men's subjective satisfaction with leisure was lower than women's, perhaps because of different frames of references between men and women. That is, it is possible that some women had adapted their preferences for leisure to what seemed possible within their circumstances and so reported higher satisfaction rates, whereas their actual hours of leisure per day might be lower. This may pose challenges in using the question for monitoring purposes, because if a woman's frame of reference changes, her reported satisfaction might go down, but that may not reflect a decrease in leisure time itself.

It reflects the longstanding neglect of staple crops in favor of cash crops and presents an area of attention , also in light of the poverty rates among food crop growers .	For rice, cotton, and cashew nuts, the productivity increase has started. The overall objectives of the 'Agriculture for Jobs Agenda' are to enhance agricultural labor productivity in existing crops, to diversify the agricultural output mix, and to add value. In recent years, a beginning has been made on each of these fronts. Among staple crops, progress has been especially noticeable for rice, with FAO statistics suggesting annual yield gains in the order of 20 percent (Figure3.4). In light of the much lower yield levels recorded in the micro data, such a growth rate seems somewhat large and deserves further scrutiny.56 Nonetheless, irrespective of the exact growth rate, progress in rice production since the 2008 world food price crisis is real and consistent with concerted government efforts to boost domestic rice production (see section 3.3). Yield growth was negative however among other staple crops (such as roots and tubers). It reflects the longstanding neglect of staple crops in favor of cash crops and presents an area of attention, also in light of the poverty rates among food crop growers. Among cash crops, yield growth has also been revived, especially in cotton and cashew, indicating diversification beyond cocoa, though the production of coffee and pineapples declined (not reported in Figure3.4).

Similar topics, as the Thai nationals training, were covered, including the use of Eliza kits to detect aflatoxin in peanut. The trainees visited villages where Peanut CRSP technology transfer activities were ongoing (Nakornrachasrima and Udorn Thanee Villages, Khon Kaen), and Suwan Research Farm where peanut experiments were conducted. Exposure to actual field/village situation facilitated the learning process and allowed the participants to meet with village processors and extension workers. Participants in the international training, held in 2003, paid their own travel cost and hotel accommodation. The project provided training materials and other costs such as transport to the village, etc. This allowed the project to stretch the limited fund from Peanut CRSP.

Compensation schemes should be implemented, as appropriate, to meet extra expenses for assistive products. Barrier-free environments should be ensured for the effective use of assistive products. Emergency and fragile settings can incorporate provisions of assistive technology into emergency preparedness and response plans and include assistive products as part of humanitarian supplies. In countries with established systems for the provision of assistive technology, the focus should be on improving efficiency and effectiveness, by expanding coverage and improving relevance, quality and affordability, while other countries may focus on introducing and gradually expanding such systems, prioritizing cost-effective approaches. 3) Incentivize research and development of assistive technology. Provide financial incentives for research and development of assistive technology. Design assistive products and programmes in close collaboration with persons with disabilities and their organizations. Estimate needs for assistive technology and map available human and financial resources, as this evidence is a prerequisite for planning equitable services. Consider the needs of persons with all types of disabilities, including those with physical, cognitive and sensory disabilities.

"Stock believes the company is better as a result of its exporting efforts. ""It challenges us. We are able to take opportunities and things we learn in one country and apply them elsewhere. So we're always learning and one of the great parts about our job is we're connecting people throughout the world and bringing ideas from one place to the other, whether or not they directly impact our product. We're a facilitator and our customers see that. And I think it's a very strong point when they get to know us is that we're connected throughout the world and bringing solutions from one corner to the next."" One concrete example is making our products easier to use. Stock said: ""In Southeast Asia, we were struggling with language barriers. We've been very ingrained in Latin America, very comfortable working with bilingual Spanish products and clients. But as we enter the Southeast Asian market we encounter the diversity of languages. Also because we're in agriculture, one of the end-users of our products may have limited education or ability to read--so our products can be technical in nature, and how do we overcome these hurdles? And so we've begun developing and incorporating visual aids, videos, icons, logos, things that will help them understand how to use the product, what it's designated for. And we're able to take that and apply it elsewhere, because it is a universal need, but it's being driven by a specific market area force at the moment."" Perhaps the biggest lesson is that exporting is a ""no-brainer."" Stock said: ""You should be exporting. If you're not, start learning about it, talk to other exporters and just go for it. I think the key things to exporting are persistence and patience. You have to realize that when you get in this, it may not be immediate sales, it may take years, but you have to have the long-term vision. If you're willing to go through a couple of ups and downs, it can pay offin dividends. If you don't enter the export market, you're limiting your sales in a big way, no doubt about it.""

The overall research approach at Virginia Tech has been multi-disciplinary, in close collaboration with the Host Country Project Team. In Senegal, three departments were involved in this project: (1) Department of Food Science for the analysis of aflatoxin levels in peanut on farm, in storage, and in the markets; and review of food preparation practices; (2) Department of Agronomy on farming, harvesting, and post-harvest practices related to minimizing aflatoxin contamination; and (3) Social Sciences Department on gender analysis of farming and related activities, experimental methodologies for health education, and gender and health training. In 2002, farm level surveys were carried out in selected rural communities in Senegal to collect data on farming, post-harvest processing, storage, and health issues related to aflatoxin. The survey involved first year students from ENEA who collected data as part of their official activities; a report was prepared in 2003. Due to slow progress, the project was transferred to Uganda in June 2003 and project coordination was transferred to the Department of Food Science and Technology at Makerere University in Kampala. A field-level mini-survey was carried out in May 2003 in three villages to collect farming and post-harvest practices related to peanuts and aflatoxin. The survey was carried out by two Virginia Tech Teams and the Makerere University coordinator. Then a farm-level survey was carried out in 2003-2004 in four villages in the peanut growing areas of Uganda (in Mubende, Iganga, and Mayuge Districts) to assess the aflatoxin level in peanuts which was initially determined to be high by the IPM CRSP team.

It is critical to the food security of impoverished communities that do not produce enough lowland rice to meet their needs. In eastern India and Bangladesh, upland rice is grown by farmers who also have lowland fields, but who face a ""hungry month"" before lowland crops can be harvested; the upland crop, which is harvested early, bridges the family through a period when food is extremely scarce. In other areas such as the mountains of northern Lao PDR, many farm families have no lowland holdings and are heavily dependent on upland rice for subsistence.

Nonetheless , the decline in agricultural specialization across the wealth gradient is gradual and even among the wealthiest quintile , still more than two in five farmers are specialized in agriculture .	Indeed, there might be increasing reluctance to stay engaged in agriculture at current productivity levels, at least from an aspirational perspective.45 Depending on how the question is asked, two to four in five current farmers in Coted'Ivoire already report to aspire to work outside agriculture.46 This is not surprising as better-off individuals in rural areas tend to be somewhat more diversified or specialized in nonagricultural self-and wage employment, also in Coted'Ivoire (Figure2.9). Nonetheless, the decline in agricultural specialization across the wealth gradient is gradual and even among the wealthiest quintile, still more than two in five farmers are specialized in agriculture. In other countries the decline in the share of agricultural employment across the income quintiles is usually stronger. This partly also reflects the greater earnings potential offered by tradable cash crops (compared to other countries), and the more diversified and commercialized nature of agricultural activities in Coted'Ivoire (see Chapter3). With projected rural poverty rates in Coted'Ivoire still at 57 percent in 2011, it is also consistent with limited off-farm opportunities in the rural economy and its urban centers.

Building migration management capacity Through scholarship that is policy relevant but not policy driven, Migration Studies is one of a range of academic journals contributing to building migration management capacity in communities and governments around the world. The past several years have seen a worldwide proliferation of graduate programs and think tanks specializing in migration issues. At the same time, the rising political salience of migration has created a growing need for policy makers, journalists and NGO professionals in other areas to gain working familiarity with migration issues. In view of these trends, in the past two years Migration Studies has run two series 333WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 intended to contribute to the theory and practice of higher education on this topic.

Internal wiring inspections for lower risk constructions may not be necessary, as is current practice in OECD high-income economies such as Germany and Sweden. These economies do not require internal wiring checks as all electricians (i) must undergo a rigorous professional certification process and (ii) are held legally responsible that the installations they carry out are up to code.

Different cultural constructs of illness causation , such as those concerning mental health , challenge effective clinical management.22 They may also have difficulty with navigating unfamiliar health and welfare systems - especially when coming from countries with severely disrupted health systems .	The third aspect of migration and health is how health-care systems respond to migration and health. The health-care system is itself a determinant of health and, depending on the policies and legal frameworks of individual States, migrants may not be granted adequate, equitable and affordable access to health services, and/or local health systems may not have sufficient capacity to manage migrant health needs. For example, in countries of protracted crisis, migrant children fleeing conflict settings and seeking asylum with their families are more likely to have not met their vaccination targets due to disruptions in health-care delivery in countries of origin. Where health services are available, certain migrant groups may find it difficult to express symptomology and understand treatment instructions due to language barriers.

Farmers plant a rice crop alone or in association with other crops such as maize , yam , beans , cassava , or plantains .	Depending on the size of their farms and their resources, upland rice farmers use farming systems ranging from shifting to permanent cultivation. Shifting cultivation is common in Indonesia, Lao PDR, northern Thailand, and Vietnam in Asia, and in the forested areas of Latin America and West Africa. Farmers plant a rice crop alone or in association with other crops such as maize, yam, beans, cassava, or plantains. In many places, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Southwest China, and Brazil, upland rice may be intercropped with maize. In areas with sufficient rainfall, upland rice may be followed by a crop of maize, cowpea, beans, soybean, or sweet potato. In West Africa, one or more crops may be mixed with upland rice. Farmers use an area for 1-3 yr until soil fertility declines and weed and pest infestations increase. They then abandon the land and return to previously abandoned farmland or start cropping on other available fallow land. In traditional shifting cultivation systems, fallow periods were as long as 30 years. This lengthy fallow restored fertility and prevented weed seed buildup. Now, rotations in most upland areas practicing shifting cultivation have shortened to a 2-or 3-yr cycle because of increased population pressure. This has resulted in increased weed pressure and reduced soil fertility.	Farmers plant a rice crop alone or in association with other crops such as maize, yam, beans, cassava, or plantains.

Coca leaves are grown from bushes native to the Andes. The leaves contain alkaloids that can be extracted to produce commercial cocaine. The use of coca leaves has a long history. During the Incan Empire, they were chewed during religious rituals. Early Spanish settlers adopted this practice and brought it back to Europe. Many notable figures, such as Sigmund Freud, became regular users and active proponents of its ability to increase creativity and stamina, and decrease hunger. Freud supposedly began using it after hearing of the Belgian army's experiments in giving coca extracts to its soldiers, who performed better on less food over longer periods of time. The most famous legal use of coca is undoubtedly with the softdrink Coca-Cola, which initially contained marinated coca leaves. The softdrink was invented by Atlanta pharmacist Jon Pemberton as a stimulating beverage that served as a substitute for alcohol at a time when the sale of alcohol was illegal in Atlanta (Hobhouse, 2005, pp. 310-13). Today, cocaine is one of the most highly traded illegal substances in the world. Although the consumption of cocaine has spread to all corners of the globe, only three New World countries--Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia--produce the world's supply of coca leaves. In 2008, Colombia produced 62 percent, Peru produced 28 percent, and Bolivia produced 10 percent of the world's supply (U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008, p. 70). The coca industry accounts for asignificant portion of income in these countries. It is estimated that the coca leaf by itself accounts for 2.3 percent of Bolivia's GDP, and 16 percent of its total agricultural production (U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008, p. 233). In Colombia, a country with a much larger economy, the analogous numbers are smaller, but still significant: 0.5 and 5 percent (U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, 2009, p. 6).

The Ecological Footprint measures the current state of resource use and waste generation .	Does the Ecological Footprint matter if the supply of renewable resources can be increased and advances in technology can slow the depletion of non-renewable resources? The Ecological Footprint measures the current state of resource use and waste generation. It asks: In a given year, did human demand on ecosystems exceed the ability of ecosystems to meet this demand? Footprint analysis reflects both increases in the productivity of renewable resources (for example, if the productivity of cropland is increased, then the Footprint of 1 tonne of wheat will decrease) and technological innovation (for example, if the paper industry doubles the overall efficiency of paper production, the Footprint per tonne of paper will be cut by half ). Ecological Footprint accounts capture these changes as they occur and can determine the extent to which these innovations have succeeded in bringing human demand within the capacity of the planet's ecosystems. If there is a sufficient increase in ecological supply and a reduction in human demand due to technological advances or other factors, Footprint accounts will show this as the elimination of global overshoot.

New securities and investment structures are emerging with each passing year .	"Sustainable finance may be experiencing a golden age of innovation. New securities and investment structures are emerging with each passing year. The question is whether such creativity is fostering a market in which risks and rates of return are fully transparent, comparable, and accessible in ways that can be consistently monetized. The risk-return conundrum for those investing in green finance is pervasive and challenging. Should investors accept a lower return on green bonds from a given issuer than on that issuer's ""brown"" offerings? Should issuers expect lower financing costs--a so-called greenium? Should they accept lower internal rates of return on green private equity or infrastructure investments? Fiduciaries' initial reaction has, in many cases, been ""no,"" but this is changing.

Consumption components (also consumption categories): Ecological Footprint analyses can allocate total Footprint among consumption components, typically food, shelter, mobility, goods, and services, often with further resolution into sub-components. Consistent categorization across studies allows for comparison of the Footprint of individual consumption components across regions, and the relative contribution of each category to the region's overall Footprint.

Prototypes of small-scale machinery for digging, threshing, and sorting peanut have been developed with support from Peanut CRSP. The use of these machineries was demonstrated to farmers during field days. Peanut programs. A National Peanut Program and a Peanut Seed Production Program are in place due to the support of the Peanut CRSP to Bolivia. The government has recognized ANAPO as the national reference institution for peanut research and development. It has developed a private Peanut Seed System that is patterned after its Seed Production System for soybeans, wheat, sunflower, and wheat of ANAPO. Seed, other agrochemical inputs, and technical advice are provided by ANAPO to producers at planting time and paid for during harvest at cost plus a minimal fee. Consumers' survey. A consumers' survey was carried out in 2002, which showed that the processing industry is not developed, with only 2-3 processors in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. Peanut soup, preferred by 70% of the respondents, is generally produced in the home using traditional recipes. Other products are roasted and salted peanuts. Consumption is seasonal taking place during the first six months after harvest. The result of this survey is critical in understanding the local market potential and initiating activities in processing and utilization for domestic and export markets. Information on consumers' preferences in the target exporting countries would also be useful.	Project UFL16P - 199 - Farm machineries.

Incentives for firms to create jobs and for people to work are important if the economy is going to diversify its export base .	The main challenge facing resource-rich countries is to spread the wealth in ways that do not undermine productivity growth and social cohesion spillovers. Good jobs for development in this context are those that generate output (as opposed to just absorbing it) outside the extractive industries sector. Incentives for firms to create jobs and for people to work are important if the economy is going to diversify its export base. The abundance of foreign currency can be a constraint because of exchange rate appreciation.

This variable aims to capture technology differences between countries in explaining trade patterns .	The relative factor endowment variable (RFE) is defined as the absolute value of the difference between natural logarithm of per capita GDPs between country i and country j. The choice of this variable as an explanatory variable is based on the standard comparative advantage explanation of trade. This variable aims to capture technology differences between countries in explaining trade patterns. Though this variable is generally measured as the absolute value of the difference between natural logarithm of capital-labour ratio, due to the unavailability of that data, per capita GDP is used in place of capital-labour ratios.

Currently, there is no single straightforward measure of poverty from a gender perspective, and no single internationally agreed-upon indicator that can give more meaningful poverty counts for women and men. That would require taking into account intra-household inequality, including through the use of some individuallevel indicators on selected dimensions of poverty (see box 8.2 on multidimensional poverty).

This inverse relationship between farm size and productivity was first observed in South Asia.27 But it has also emerged in Sub-Saharan Africa as population pressure on the land has led to agricultural intensification. In Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, a 1 percent increase in farm size is associated with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent reduction in yield.28 The use of family labor per hectare is also inversely correlated with farm size.29 The relationship between crop yields and farm size emerges, because the larger, more mechanized farms have higher productivity. But in the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia and 39 percent in Chile. In services sectors, their role is often more important. Even in Eastern European countries, where private sector entry is only two decades old, microenterprises account for 10 to 20 percent of employment in manufacturing and for 30 to 50 percent of employment in services. Micro-and small enterprises also play a critical role in job creation and destruction (box 3.2).26 In farms, uneven technological progress It is generally assumed that large farms are more productive. In low-income countries, however, In some household and labor force surveys, employees are asked to report the size of the firm they work for, or the size of their own business if they are self-employed.

Growth is driven by demand for quality education among the emerging middle-income segment. Privately-funded primary and secondary schools are generally perceived by parents as worthwhile investments for their children, and those who can afford to do so will typically send their children into private education. Most private schools are based in cities. However, there are also a number of good public schools that provide higher-than-average standards of education, and place greater emphasis on English language education. These are popular among low-and middle-income families. These schools are also mainly located in urban areas, where there are more qualified teachers and greater resources. Both public and private schools are making every effort to improve the quality of their English tuition. Private schools believe that using English as a medium for teaching will help them to stand out from other schools. A comparison of interviews with public and private institutions reveals that private education places greater emphasis on English language education and commits more resources to it than public education.

How would this management be influenced by the rapidly changing economic and environmental realities ?	What role does the poverty and political isolation of a country play, and what role do ecological constraints play? Would you have thought that counties * like Canada or Sweden would belong to the ecological creditor nations? After all, Canada's per capita Footprint is 7.1 gha and Sweden's 5.1! Nevertheless, their bioproductive area is even larger. In comparison, look at Nigeria on the African continent, plagued for 10 years by civil war. Although it has a per capita Footprint of 1.0 gha, it is an ecological debtor. How should Canada or Sweden begin thinking about managing their biocapacity? How would this management be influenced by the rapidly changing economic and environmental realities? Which strategies could a country like Nigeria use to better position itself for success in future decades? How do you assess the trends for * worldwide development? Think about different scenarios: What will the future look like if things continue as they are now? How will things change if, in terms of the Footprint, positive or negative developments happen in important key countries across the planet?

Technology transfer will be stimulated from new products developed during the training of the students and researchers .	Project NCA32U - 295 - Graduate students received nine awards in 2001-2004 in recognition for their excellent research papers through graduate student paper competition. Five M.S. students completed their degrees at NCA&T and have presented their research findings at national meetings; theses topics were: development of meat analogs (2), fish mince (1), high protein snacks (1), and detoxification of aflatoxins (1). Technology transfer will be stimulated from new products developed during the training of the students and researchers. Techniques used and knowledge gained in the laboratory experiences are valuable indicators of the kind of tech transfer that can take place. A contribution to the program was the development of a scientifically equipped laboratory with University funding ($200K) and refinement of analytical procedures. A USDA, CREES Capacity Building grant ($300K) was awarded to the PI, further strengthening support of research programs, including leveraging the Peanut CRSP program at NCATSU. Because of strong administrative support and grants, major instrument and equipment buys were made to support the research program. They are Ftir, HPLC, texture analyzer, color analyzer, Nitrogen-Carbon analyzer, Autotitration system, spray dryer (for protein concentrates, isolates), twin screw extruder, Elisa system (allergens) and a UV light instrument. Note, the Twin Screw Extruder, contributing strongly to food product development in the program was purchased with Peanut CRSP funds.

CHW programmes included in these reviews were diverse in the interventions provided , selection and training of CHWs , supervision , remuneration and integration into the health system .	The objective of this analysis was to synthesize current understanding of how CHW programmes can best be designed and operated in health systems. The review team identified 122 reviews (75 systematic reviews, of which 34 were meta-analyses, and 47 non-systematic reviews). CHW programmes included in these reviews were diverse in the interventions provided, selection and training of CHWs, supervision, remuneration and integration into the health system. Features that appeared to enable positive CHW programme outcomes included community embeddedness (whereby community members have a sense of ownership of the programme and positive relationships with the CHWs), supportive supervision, continuous education, adequate logistical support and supplies, and integration with the health system. The review team found gaps in the evidence, including on the rights and needs of CHWs, on effective approaches to training and supervision, on CHWs as community change agents, and on the influence of health system decentralization, social accountability, and governance. While the findings of the systematic review of reviews, having captured evidence from independently commissioned reviews, were typically not specific to the focus of the PICO questions, in several cases they provided useful complementary evidence and contextual information on some of the PICO questions. 6.2 Systematic reviews on the 15 PICO questions The Centre for Evidence and Implementation, in consortium with the University of Melbourne, Campbell Collaboration, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), University of Toronto, University of Newcastle, University of Sydney, University of Adelaide, University of Iowa, American Institutes for Research and Aga Khan University, was selected through a competitive bidding process to develop the systematic reviews for each of the 15 PICO questions selected by the GDG.

Eventually some of them become leaders of different chambers and other government bodies, thereby cementing a close link between politics and business. The reasons for this close nexus between politics and business are quite straightforward:21 * Successful entrepreneurs have the financial resources required to finance electoral competition. * The entry of business into politics becomes a business investment. It assures access to state resources, gives a competitive edge over business rivals and establishes influence over the policy process.

This is a humanitarian action to help those who need it most: people with no access to healthcare providers, who can't afford medical care, or live in cities with high demographic density or high vulnerability (sites with high spread of coronavirus) or who need specialized consultation (psychiatry, pneumology, geriatrics, etc.) to ensure continuity of care. This project also provides an alternative to healthcare workers in high-risk groups to continue their activities remotely, and to the overloaded and high cost phone-based solutions provided by governments with long waiting lines."

This chapter examines the links between gender and the environment in two parts .	Women and the environment is one of the 12 critical areas of concern for achieving gender equality identified in the Beijing Platform for Action.1 The Platform for Action recognizes that environmental conditions have a different impact on the lives of women and men due to existing gender inequality. It also stresses that women's role in sustainable development is hampered by unequal access to economic resources, information and technology, and limited participation in policy formulation and decision-making in natural resources and environment management. This chapter examines the links between gender and the environment in two parts. The first part looks at three aspects of the environment that have different effects on the lives of women and men:2 access to water and sanitation, access to modern energy services, and exposure to natural hazards. It shows that the burden of work resulting from lack of access to clean water and energy falls mostly on the shoulders of women. In ad- 1 United Nations, 1995. 2 Other aspects of the environment that may have a different impact on the lives of women and men could not be analysed due to lack of data (see box 7.1). dition, exposure to inadequate water may result in higher mortality among women than men as a result of diarrhoea in contexts where access to health services remains unequal. Household air pollution resulting from the use of firewood and other solid fuels threatens the lives of women and men in many developing countries, but women are more exposed than men to indoor pollutants due to their role in cooking and caring for children and other family members. Gender roles may also worsen women's vulnerability during disasters and waste their potential as a source of resilience.

IUCN defines this governance type as : protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and / or local communities through various forms of customary or legal , formal or informal , institutions and rules .	Type D: Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities. This type includes two main subsets: (1) indigenous peoples' areas and territories established and run by indigenous peoples and (2) community conserved areas established and run by local communities. The subsets, which may not be neatly separated, apply to both sedentary and mobile peoples and communities. IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules. These can be relatively complex. For instance, land and/or sea resources may be collectively owned and managed while other resources may be managed individually or on a clan basis. Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times, or of different resources within the same area. Rules generally intertwine with cultural and spiritual values. The customary rules and organizations managing natural resources often possess no statutory legal recognition or sanctioning power. In other cases, however, indigenous peoples and/or local communities are fully recognised as the legitimate authority in charge of state-listed protected areas or have legal title to the land, water or resources. Whatever the structure, the governance arrangements require IUCN recognises four broad types of governance of protected areas, any of which can be associated with any management objective: A. Governance by government B. Shared governance C. Private governance D. Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities 3. Governance that the area under the control of indigenous peoples and/or local communities has identifiable institutions and regulations that are responsible for achieving the protected area objectives.

Yet even remarkably successful East Asian economies such as Korea and Singapore , which undoubtedly delivered inclusive growth over many decades , also had jobs strategies at specific points in their development histories ( box 2.6 ) .	Jobs strategies are not needed under all circumstances. A jobs strategy is warranted only when potentially important spillovers from jobs are not realized, leading to tensions between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion. When improvements in living standards, productivity, and social cohesion happen together, as was the case in several East Asian countries, and may now be the case in urbanizing economies such as Bangladesh, a growth strategy may be more appropriate. Yet even remarkably successful East Asian economies such as Korea and Singapore, which undoubtedly delivered inclusive growth over many decades, also had jobs strategies at specific points in their development histories (box 2.6). erated rates of growth and connections with international markets but generate little direct (or even indirect) employment and often little poverty reduction. Moreover, the abundance of foreign exchange undermines the competitiveness of other activities, making it difficult to create productive jobs in other sectors. * In countries with high youth unemployment, job opportunities are not commensurate with the expectations created by the expansion of education systems. And the active labor market programs needed to defuse social tensions in the short term may not do much for poverty reduction because many of the jobless come from middle-class families, and devoting public resources to finance them may reduce economic dynamism. * In formalizing economies, there is an effort to support social cohesion by extending the coverage of social protection to as many workers as possible. Broad coverage regardless of the type of job is often seen as part of a social compact. But extending coverage without distorting incentives to work, save, and participate in formal systems is difficult and may have adverse impacts on productivity and long-term growth.

In the struggle to manage IAS , promoting international scientific cooperation should be a top priority on all national , regional , and global agendas .	In many fields, international scientific cooperation is often the cheapest and most effective way to advance both knowledge and best practices. The last two decades have seen amazingly rapid advances in both our understanding of biological invasions and in political awareness of the problems they cause. For example, the Subsidiary Body on Scientific Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to the Convention on Biological Diversity35 has made IAS a cross-cutting theme. Similar steps are being taken elsewhere for example, at the World Wide Fund for Nature (Cronk & Fuller, 1995), in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands36, and in the 31 http://www.biodiv.org/programmes/cross-cutting/taxonomy/default.asp 32 http://www.iubs.org 33 http://www.bionet-intl.org/ 34 http://www.issg.org 35 http://www.biodiv.org 36 http://www.ramsar.org International Maritime Organization37. These advances are attributable in no small measure to international cooperation. The efforts of groups such SCOPE, IUCN, and other GISP partners are clearly paying off. In the struggle to manage IAS, promoting international scientific cooperation should be a top priority on all national, regional, and global agendas. Wherever possible this should be done within the framework of existing mechanisms so as to maximize the use of scarce resources. GISP is poised to play a crucial role in this process globally and to build the capacity to minimize the spread and impact of IAS at national and sub-national levels.

"The EU's approach to standards-related measures, including its conformity assessment framework, and its efforts to encourage governments around the world to adopt its approach, including European regional standards, creates a challenging environment for U.S. exporters. In particular, the EU's approach impedes market access for products that conform to international standards as opposed to European regional standards (called European harmonized standards or ENs), even though international standards may meet or exceed the EU (or third country) regulatory requirements. U.S. producers and exporters thus face additional burdens in accessing the EU or other markets not faced by EU exporters and producers in accessing the U.S. market. In 1985, the EU adopted what is known as the ""New Approach"" to the use of standards for products.1 The ""New Approach"" was updated in 2008 and rebranded as the ""new Legislative Framework"" (NLF). The NLF represents a package of measures meant to clarify EU product marking requirements, establish a common legal framework for industrial products, and improve product safety, often through the involvement of market surveillance authorities.2 Product requirements in a variety of sectors (e.g., toys, machinery, medical devices) are regulated through NLF legislation. Under the NLF, EU legislation sets out the ""essential requirements"" that products must meet in order to be placed in the EU market and benefit from free movement within the EU.

"In many societies, the family lineage is carried on by male children. The preservation of the family name is guaranteed through the son(s). Except in a few countries (e.g. Ethiopia), a girl takes her husband's family name, dropping that of her own parents. The fear of losing a name prompts families to wish to have a son. Some men marry a second or a third wife to be sure of having a male child. Among many communities in Asia and Africa, sons perform burial rites for parents. Parents with no male child do not expect to have an appropriate burial to ""secure their peace in the next world"". In almost all religions, ceremonies are performed by men. Priests, pastors, sheikhs and other religious leaders are men of great status to whom society attaches great importance, and this important role for men obliges parents to wish for a male child. Religious leaders have a major involvement in the perpetuation of son preference."	In almost all religions, ceremonies are performed by men.

It is estimated that Sub-Saharan Africa has approximately 130 million ha of inland-valley lowlands and their hydromorphic fringes within which rice can be cultivated .	The rainfed lowland ecosystem comprises floodplains and inland valleys. Overall, rice is grown on about 1.4 million ha of rainfed lowlands representing 30% of the total rice area and 36.5% of regional production. Average yield across the rainfed lowlands is 2.0 t/ha. In the floodplains, rice can be grown on residual and water-table moisture in the broad, flat areas adjacent to rivers prone to seasonal flooding. Enormous technical potential exists to expand rice production in inland-valley lowlands, as currently only about 10-15% of these areas are cultivated. It is estimated that Sub-Saharan Africa has approximately 130 million ha of inland-valley lowlands and their hydromorphic fringes within which rice can be cultivated. Of this total, West Africa may have about 20-30 million ha. The diversity of inland valleys is large.

Bangladesh has recorded many impressive achievements in economic and social development over the last decade. It has attained steady economic growth of 4% to 5% annually, relatively low inflation and a stable domestic debt. More remarkable, have been the achievements in reducing income poverty and improving social indicators such as life expectancy, fertility control, child mortality, literacy and enrolment rates, which in many cases exceed other countries in the region and outside. This has happened in spite of natural disasters and weak governance, including corruption. The progress in social and economic development is in part due to effective management of the macro-economy, private sector-led growth, the use of new technologies (e.g. immunisation) and the contribution of NGOs to basic service delivery (i.e. education, health, water and sanitation).

Depending on the nature of the jobs challenges facing a country , tensions may emerge between growth that generates jobs for living standards and growth that generates jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion .	When a growth strategy may not be sufficient Focusing on the aggregate relationship between growth and employment downplays some of the most important channels through which jobs connect to development. The very notion of employment as derived labor demand does not reflect the situation of the many working people in developing countries who are farmers and self-employed. The focus on the labor market as the transmission chain between growth and employment also does not capture the interaction of working people with others in households, at the workplace, and in society more broadly. Focusing solely on the relationship between growth and employment may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender equality, support urbanization, or contribute Growth strategies or jobs strategies? 88 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 In practice, however, tradeoffs between the three transformations can amount to more than just lags and gaps. Depending on the nature of the jobs challenges facing a country, tensions may emerge between growth that generates jobs for living standards and growth that generates jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion. Examples abound: * In agrarian economies, increasing productivity in smallholder farming is fundamental for poverty reduction, given the share of the population living in rural areas. But urban jobs in activities that connect the economy to world markets and global value chains are necessary for growth. With limited resources to support both, a tradeoff between living standards and productivity may arise. * In resource-rich countries, massive investments in extractive industries support accel- to peaceful collective decision making. Understanding how to enhance these positive spillovers from jobs might be difficult when only aggregates are considered.

While credentialing may in theory negatively impact equity ( by limiting the number of CHWs authorized to practise to those awarded a formal licence , thereby restricting access to services ) , in many contexts it can be a pathway to greater competency of CHWs ( and hence improved patient safety through better quality of care ) .	"To reduce CHW drop-out rates and to ensure a sense of commitment to service, an earlier review suggested that CHW programmes should set up clear appointment and deployment strategies for CHWs who pass the final exam at the end of a training and receive a certificate of course completion (13). However, there is little formal evidence that suggests that certification improves outcomes. In this section, the guideline explores the evidence and provides policy guidance on competency-based, formal certification for CHWs who have successfully completed pre-service training. 7.5.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that the very limited evidence points to a positive, though largely untested, potential of formal credentialing of CHWs. While credentialing may in theory negatively impact equity (by limiting the number of CHWs authorized to practise to those awarded a formal licence, thereby restricting access to services), in many contexts it can be a pathway to greater competency of CHWs (and hence improved patient safety through better quality of care). Further, it can enhance credibility, recognition and employability of CHWs. On this basis, the GDG supported a conditional recommendation in favour of formal certification. 7.5.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.5) addressing the question - ""For community health workers who have received pre-service training, should competency-based formal certification be used versus not?"" (96) - identified four eligible qualitative studies that reported on how certification processes were perceived by small, non-representative samples of CHWs. Two studies were conducted in the United States, one of which reported on state-based credentialing of CHWs occurring in four states (68), while the other summarized certification experience from New York City (97). A national view on certification was also included in a study from the Islamic Republic of Iran, where certification is the norm and is required to achieve employment as a CHW (75). In a fourth study, from Ethiopia, certification was one among many topics discussed with interviewees who represented a scoped community mobilization project (98)."	While credentialing may in theory negatively impact equity (by limiting the number of CHWs authorized to practise to those awarded a formal licence, thereby restricting access to services), in many contexts it can be a pathway to greater competency of CHWs (and hence improved patient safety through better quality of care).

Educational institutions are the places where tuition is supposed to take place. The teachers and the students jointly participate in classroom situation to achieve education. The education provision is such that in majority cases the students require study at home in order to supplement school education. It is done in the form of homework and learning what was asked by the schoolteachers. Studying at home requires tutoring support, which sometimes the parents, relatives or the household members provide and sometimes do not, so, an external support is often sought for this and such support is sometimes provided free of cost and often on a payment basis. Therefore, private tutoring means payment-based tutoring support to the students outside official school hour (Nath, 2006, p.1).

Country Notes Basic education (Enseignement fondamental) lasts for nine years and leads to the Brevet d'enseignement fondamental. Secondary education is compulsory and consists of a three-year cycle of study provided in secondary schools and technicums. There are two branches of secondary education: general and specialized and technical/vocational. Students in general secondary and specialized secondary education study for three years. Successful students are awarded the Baccalaureat de l'Enseignement secondaire in one of the various streams offered. The Baccalaureat gives access to higher education but some institutions require it to be of a certain type (science, arts, etc.). The objective of technical and vocational secondary education is to prepare students for active life and industry (technicians and qualified workers). Studies last between one and four years, according to the type of training undertaken and can also lead to the Baccalaureat technique and higher education.

MENA's below-average competitiveness is primarily a result of low scores on indicators related to natural and cultural resources and international openness. The region's historical and religious heritage and geographic features create the potential for significant natural and cultural tourism; yet, while some individual nations come close, no MENA country scores above the global average for natural resources and only Egypt and Iran score above for cultural resources. In fact, the entire region's score in both of these areas has fallen in recent years. More needs to be done to expand habit protection and heritage sites. Moreover, digital demand for MENA's natural, cultural and entertainment demand is fairly low, indicating potential gaps in marketing and traveller perceptions. One potential reason for this gap is continued safety and security concerns. Eleven MENA countries rank within the bottom 40 for terrorism incidents, with two among the worst 10 countries globally. Further, the region is plagued by geopolitical tensions, instability and conflict. Security concerns also play a role in why MENA members are some of the most restrictive when it comes to international openness, with only Qatar, Oman and Morocco making significant improvements. Consequently, travellers often face barriers when visiting the region, while the aviation and overall T&T sector is stifled by limiting bilateral air service and regional trade agreements.

Indeed, there might be increasing reluctance to stay engaged in agriculture at current productivity levels, at least from an aspirational perspective.45 Depending on how the question is asked, two to four in five current farmers in Coted'Ivoire already report to aspire to work outside agriculture.46 This is not surprising as better-off individuals in rural areas tend to be somewhat more diversified or specialized in nonagricultural self-and wage employment, also in Coted'Ivoire (Figure2.9). Nonetheless, the decline in agricultural specialization across the wealth gradient is gradual and even among the wealthiest quintile, still more than two in five farmers are specialized in agriculture. In other countries the decline in the share of agricultural employment across the income quintiles is usually stronger. This partly also reflects the greater earnings potential offered by tradable cash crops (compared to other countries), and the more diversified and commercialized nature of agricultural activities in Coted'Ivoire (see Chapter3). With projected rural poverty rates in Coted'Ivoire still at 57 percent in 2011, it is also consistent with limited off-farm opportunities in the rural economy and its urban centers.

Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school .	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.

Selected Country/Economy Analysis Spain remains the most competitive economy in the world when it comes to T&T. The nation is the second-most visited destination in the world and has developed an economy that is focused on tourism, with over half of internal T&T spending coming from international visitors. Spain's main points of attraction are its excellent natural (9th) and cultural (3rd) resources, with the latter being its greatest advantage relative to the rest of the world. The country is a centre for international meetings (4th) and sporting events and has the strongest combination of intangible culture and heritage sites (1st) in the world. The number of UNESCO-recognized Natural Heritage sites has also increased (11th to 9th), helping to boost the attractiveness of its natural assets (23rd to 10th). Servicing travellers is an exceptional tourism infrastructure (3rd), including a high hotel density. Intra-country travel is supported by quality railroads (11th) and roads (13th), while good port infrastructure (12th) could help the cruise industry. The nation's many international arrivals can rely on strong air transport infrastructure (10th), which includes a wide range of operating airlines (5th) that provide a considerable route capacity (8th). Moreover, like much of higher-income Europe, the country performs well in areas related to its overall enabling environment (33rd), with a solid global relative advantage on ICT readiness (27th) and security (16th).

But jobs agendas of individual countries are connected through globalization : trade in goods and services , investment flows , and migration of workers .	There are also hidden losers. These are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries which have failed to develop new industries and services connected to world markets and the jobs that go with them.59 Workers in those countries, however, may not perceive the lost employment opportunities.60 One way to mitigate the welfare losses from globalization, both apparent and hidden, is through the international migration of workers. Income differentials across countries, which reflect differences in the growth rates of different economies, are important drivers of this migration. By reallocating workers from stagnant or slowly growing economies to rapidly growing ones, the international migration of workers contributes to the reduction in the QUESTION 7 Many developing countries face a jobs agenda. In some, it involves offering avenues to rural populations to move out of poverty. In others, it aims at leveraging the gains from urbanization and from integration in global markets. Yet in others, the goal is to prevent youth from becoming disenfranchised or to reduce the risk of conflict. These agendas are addressed through national policies that stimulate job creation by the private sector, especially in the areas and activities where development payoffs are highest. But jobs agendas of individual countries are connected through globalization: trade in goods and services, investment flows, and migration of workers. This begs the question: if jobs can migrate from one country to another, do policies to support job creation in one country become policies affecting jobs in other countries--policies competing for jobs globally? Among economists, the conventional wisdom is that the number of jobs is not determined by international trade and investment but by the total number of people in the labor force. And in general, openness to international trade and foreign direct investment is beneficial for all the countries involved. Thus, globalization is not a zero-sum game. From this point of view, policies to support job creation are not policies competing for jobs, even as they may alter the global flows of trade, investment, and workers.

IAS are one of the most significant drivers of environmental change globally (Sala et al., 2000, McNeely, 2001, McNeely et al., 2001). In the United States, IAS now rank second to habitat conversion as a cause of species endangerment and extinction (Wilcove et al., 1998). Even the most well protected natural areas are not immune to IAS (Chapin, 2000, Simberloff, 2000, Simonson et al., 2001, Parkes et al., 2002, Tye et al., 2002, O Dowd et al., 2003). The decimation of native species by the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) illustrates the potential for a single IAS to cause significant and permanent losses to biodiversity in a relatively short time frame. The snake, which is native to northern Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, was accidentally introduced to the Pacific island of Guam in the 1940s, probably in military transports. Within sixty years it spread throughout the island, reaching numbers as high as 12,000 per square mile in some forests. It has eliminated nine of the island s eleven native land bird species, adversely impacting other fauna, such as native lizards (Savidge, 1987, Fritts, 2001). A single ecosystem can suffer numerous invasions, with resultant changes in its structure, function, and ability to provide natural resources. Much of the developing world is just beginning to observe significant impacts of IAS in their ecosystems. In contrast, some ecosystems in the developed world, such as the eastern forests of the United States, have been suffering losses from IAS for centuries (e.g. near-extinction of American chestnut, Castanea dentata, as a result of root rot, Phytophthora cinnamomi, and blight, Cryphonectira parasitica). This is due in large part to the long history of trade and transport between regions with similar climate between the eastern U.S. and Europe, for example (Bright, 1999, Baskin, 2002).

"The East Asian trends are consistent with the ""flying geese"" pattern of development, where economic transformation is consistent with dynamic changes in comparative advantage. Industrialization in East Asian countries began with the development of labor-intensive sectors, gradually shifted to capital-intensive sectors, and then to knowledge-intensive activities. In parallel, wages rose and skills increased.35 First Japan, then Korea, and more recently China followed a similar pattern. As labor costs increase further, light manufacturing jobs are likely to migrate away from coastal China, where most industries have concentrated. By some estimates, nearly 100 million jobs are at stake.36 The migration of light manufacturing jobs out of coastal China could open a once-in-ageneration opportunity for countries in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia to jump-start their industrialization. But some observers predict that the migration will go mainly to the inland areas in China, where wage rates are lower than on the coast. This would be consistent with the patterns of industrialization in Japan; Korea; Taiwan, China; and the United States, where the initial geographical concentration of industries was followed by dispersion within the same country.37 However, China's labor market is relatively integrated to the point where even unskilled wage rates in rural areas have been increasing rapidly.38 Therefore, an overall decline in the manufacturing share of GDP in China might be unavoidable, opening up the opportunity for labor-intensive industrialization in other developing countries.39 The rapid growth of labor productivity in manufacturing is resulting in the stagnation or even the decline of the number of manufacturing jobs worldwide (figure 7.2).

The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it?

Wilson , Evolutionary biologist and Harvard professor emeritus Part 1 Introduction , overview , structure .	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where. This view of the world has proven to be sufficient for raising central questions and sparking the conversations that are needed to reverse current trends.

Specific: Peanut CRSP to continue product development in the next phase. Further development of value added peanut products and improvement and fine-tuning of the processes are needed to bring them to pilot production stage. Integrating a strong technology transfer component, especially in the host country would facilitate the transfer of Peanut-CRSP technologies (new food products and processes) to the region through Senegal. Refocus the efforts in the U.S. and Senegal towards more commercialization of these technologies and intensive training of key stakeholders, in the U.S. and Senegal. This would necessitate new partnerships involving the private food industry (focusing on small-to medium-scale businesses), the public (government entities), and public (or NGOs) extension providers, health workers, traders, and other stakeholders, including donors. ITA should continue to provide research support and coordination to ensure sustainability and quality of the products produced in Senegal. The Peanut CRSP project at NCATSU includes emphasis on development of aflatoxin-free value-added peanut foods, feeds and nutraceuticals from peanut products and co-products suitable for the Senegal and U.S. markets. Work is examining the use of aluminosilicate clays (Attapulgite) to reduce levels of aflatoxins in cottage industry peanut paste. The results are very promising. It is recommended that this work be expanded to include that of Peanut CRSP project OKS55. The combined effort could focus on the aflatoxin problem throughout countries in West Africa. Proper funding would be required to assure success of the program.

Chapter 1 looks at the agricultural impacts of cultivating tobacco. Chapter 2 discusses the various negative consequences of manufacturing and distributing tobacco - from the use of fossil fuels to the production of hazardous waste. It also addresses some of the challenges in monitoring and measuring such damage. Chapter 3 focuses on the environmental damage caused by the immediate consumption of tobacco products, while Chapter 4 examines the post-consumption waste and health implications that continue to play out long after the tobacco has been smoked. Chapter 5 provides more detail on the economic implications of tobacco from an environmental perspective. Finally, Chapter 6 provides insight into which institutions have addressed these issues (and what policy approaches have been implemented to date), as well as challenges that need to be tackled. 4/ To b a c c o a n d i t s e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t : a n o v e r v i e w 1 Tobacco growing and curing: impact on land and agriculture Commercial tobacco farming takes place on a massive scale. In 2012 it produced almost 7.5 million metric tonnes of tobacco leaf on 4.3 million hectares of agricultural land in at least 124 countries (see Figure 2). In recent decades transnational tobacco corporations have lowered production costs by shifting tobacco leaf production from high-income to low-income countries, where around 90% of tobacco farming now takes place (2). China, Brazil and India are the largest tobacco leaf growers, with China accounting for 3.2 million metric tonnes (3).

Poor or inconsistent public services , including electricity , security , and transportation infrastructure , can quickly raise costs - - through delays , lost production , and the expense of privately providing these services .	The location-decision question has been examined empirically by looking at how the characteristics of host countries predict the inflow of FDI and entry of multinationals. Significant macroeconomic instability or conflict disqualifies most locations. Low wages can be attractive, but given that labor is often a small share of overall manufacturing costs, they are often not the predominant consideration. And labor costs cannot be evaluated separately from the quality of skills; developed countries remain significant destinations of FDI in part because of their highly skilled workforces. Access to land, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia where land access is more regulated, can be a significant consideration.

Moreover , in conserving these quality habitats , a critical service is being provided to people who are facing increasing shortages of potable / useful water .	"The extent of extractive activities and the level to which they are regulated is an important consideration when determining the appropriate IUCN category to an MPA (or zone within an MPA). Extractive use including any type of fishing is not consistent with the objectives of categories Ia and Ib, and unlikely to be consistent with category II. 6. Classifying MPAs by what they do and not by the title of the category Assignment of a MPA to an IUCN category should be based on consideration of management objectives, rather than the names of the categories. The same name or title for a MPA may mean different things in different countries. For example, the term ""sanctuary"", as used in the United States context, is a multiple-use MPA that is designated under the National Marine Sanctuary Program (e.g., Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary). However ""sanctuary"" takes on a very different meaning elsewhere - in the UK, the term has been used to refer to strictly protected marine reserves in which all extractive use is prohibited. As with terrestrial and inland water protected areas, categories are independent of names in MPAs. 6. Specialized applications Inland water protected areas Inland water ecosystems occupy only a small area of the planet but are perhaps the most heavily impacted and threatened by human activities of all biomes and habitats. Governments and the conservation community have made commitments to conserve inland water species and habitats equal to those for the marine and terrestrial realms, but those commitments have yet to be fully realized. Moreover, in conserving these quality habitats, a critical service is being provided to people who are facing increasing shortages of potable/useful water.

"Migration is intertwined with technology and innovation and there exists a large body of analysis that has assessed how international migration acts to support (and sometimes limit) the transfer of technology and knowledge, often working in tandem with investment and trade flows along historical, geographic and geopolitical connections between countries and communities.24 Technology is increasingly critical throughout the migration process, especially newer forms of technology. In recent years, for example, we have witnessed the use of ICT by migrants to gather information and advice in real time during migration journeys; an issue that is raising interest and, at times, concern.

"In recent years, the political economy discourse has evolved beyond that of simply noting the lack of political will to look more deeply into the main incentives, rules and constraints that characterise key institutions in Bangladesh - from bureaucracy to law enforcement agencies. Recent studies include a political economy assessment of financial management reform.8 There is a general consensus amongst Bangladeshi and international stakeholders that the international community needs to take into account the following political economy dimensions when supporting governance reforms in Bangladesh: The GoB is only responsive where demands for change do not threaten the patronage system; little real action is taken elsewhere.9 This explains success in promoting macroeconomic stabilisation but failure in pushing ahead with the fight against corruption and civil service reforms. ""The lack of political will and commitment to ending patronage and politicisation within the Bangladesh civil service prevents any radical reform of the public service in Bangladesh"".10 The politicisation of administration has left the Bangladesh civil service divided, has broken its chain of command and hierarchy and weakened its internal and external accountability mechanisms.11 Certain aspects of politicisation - such as transfers to 'officers on special duty' - are intensely disliked by the bureaucracy, which remain for the majority apolitical. At the same time, the country is often said to be run by a handful of bureaucrats that enjoy power and prestige for being allied to the party in power."

In Chad and Niger , more than 80 percent of schools are underperforming on learning outcomes , compared with only 1 percent in Burundi .	The most effective way to improve overall outcomes is to focus on those who are particularly disadvantaged, and there are sizable disparities by wealth and location, with only about two-thirds as many children from the poorest families attaining minimum proficiency levels in math or reading by the end of primary school as did children from the richest families. Gender parity in learning outcomes exhibit significant variance from country to country, with girls or boys scoring higher in math or reading or both.

Training of South East Asian Scientists : An international training course on Peanut Processing and - Uutilization Technologies was held in September 2003 .	Thai Aid, the Thai Government's Development Aid Agency, has a program to assist developing countries in the region, such as Timor-Leste, through its Thai International Cooperation Program (TICP). Thai Aid could leverage Peanut-CRSP funding and future training on peanut could be funded through the TICP Program in the other collaborating countries. Peanut CRSP scientists and the Management Entity should support the Thai Project Team to pursue this opportunity. Kasetsart University-KAPI could access the Small-and Medium Enterprises Fund from the Ministry of Industry to support training activities. The objective is to train staff from private industry for 10-15 days on processing technologies and on good industry practices. The experience in partnering with private food companies using the Industry Incubator Model, developed in the Philippines in collaboration with Peanut CRSP, would be useful for the Thai trainers involved in this project. Training of South East Asian Scientists: An international training course on Peanut Processing and -Uutilization Technologies was held in September 2003. Participants included 13 scientists (6 women and 7 men) from 9 countries: Bulgaria (2), Cambodia (2), Indonesia (1), Lao PDR (1), Malaysia (1), Mayanmar (1), Philippines (2), Thailand (2), and Timor-Leste (1). Similar topics, as the Thai nationals training, were covered, including the use of Eliza kits to detect aflatoxin in peanut. The trainees visited villages where Peanut CRSP technology transfer activities were ongoing (Nakornrachasrima and Udorn Thanee Villages, Khon Kaen), and Suwan Research Farm where peanut experiments were conducted. Exposure to actual field/village situation facilitated the learning process and allowed the participants to meet with village processors and extension workers. Participants in the international training, held in 2003, paid their own travel cost and hotel accommodation. The project provided training materials and other costs such as transport to the village, etc. This allowed the project to stretch the limited fund from Peanut CRSP.

It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and , ultimately , the priorities for policy makers ( figure 14 ) .	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case.

Several systematic reviews and other studies demonstrate the effectiveness of various types of CHWs in delivering a range of preventive , promotive and curative services related to reproductive , maternal , newborn and child health ( 4-8 ) , infectious diseases ( 9 ) , noncommunicable diseases ( 10 , 11 ) , and neglected tropical diseases ( 12 ) .

However, successful delivery of services requires evidence-based models for educating, deploying, remunerating and managing CHWs to optimize their performance and contribution to the health system across various health service areas. Other systematic reviews have identified the most effective policy approaches for successful integration of health workers into health systems and the communities they serve. These include providing CHWs with predictable financial and non-financial incentives, frequent supportive supervision, continuous training, and embedding CHWs in health systems and in the communities where they work, with clear roles and communication channels for CHWs (13-17). There is also substantial evidence that delivering essential health services through CHWs may represent a cost-effective approach in a diversity of contexts (18-20). Empowering CHWs also offers a critical opening for change towards achieving greater gender equity within communities. 19 Rationale The support for CHWs and their integration into the health system and in the communities they serve are uneven across and within countries; good-practice examples are not necessarily replicated and policy options for which there is greater evidence of effectiveness are not uniformly adopted.

Ethiopia thus has the potential to compete globally in apparel thanks to a significant and growing labor cost advantage .	Conflict environments range from situations with high levels of criminal violence to The labor productivity of workers in well-managed firms in Ethiopia is comparable with that in China and Vietnam, although wages are only a quarter of those in China and half those in Vietnam. Ethiopia thus has the potential to compete globally in apparel thanks to a significant and growing labor cost advantage. It is also close to a state-of-the-art and well-located container port in Djibouti and has duty-free access to the markets of the European Union and the United States. The binding constraint on Ethiopia's competitiveness in apparel is poor trade logistics, which wipe out its labor cost advantage and cut the country off from the higher-value time-sensitive segments of the market. Establishing a fast-track channel for moving apparel through customs, providing free and immediate access to foreign exchange, reducing the cost of letters of credit, and setting up an industrial zone closer to Djibouti would alleviate the most important trade logistics bottlenecks. These steps would also put Ethiopia in a position to attract investors to lead the industry in the same way that China and Vietnam have done.

Country Notes The common education structure at the school level follows the pattern of '10 + 2'; ten years of basic education, followed by two years of upper secondary school. Classes and grade levels have different names depending on the state in which instruction takes place. Terminology for school leaving examinations can be confusing as it also varies. The basic structure for schooling is comprised of eight years of elementary education; five years of lower elementary (Standards I to V), three years of higher elementary (Standards VI to VIII). This is followed by two years of secondary education (Standards IX and X). At the end of ten years of schooling a Secondary School Certificate is awarded upon passing the examinations set by the relevant State or Central Board of Secondary Education. Students who wish to continue for higher studies must complete a two-year higher secondary program (Standards XI and XII), choosing science, humanities or vocational streams, which culminates in the Higher Secondary Certificate or Standard XII examination certificate. This certificate is the minimum requirement for admission to degree programs at Indian universities. It should be noted that a variety of names exist for the final examinations of this level of education.

"This special issue , "" Global Profile of Nursing Regulation , Education , and Practice , "" summarizes the rich data contained within Global Regulatory Atlas into an enlightening anthology that captures the similarities , differences and details of nursing around the world ."	"The global Regulatory Atlas in fall 2016, NCSBN hosted the landmark Regulation 2030 conference. Regulation 2030 brought together nursing regulators and leaders from eight countries, nursing professional organizations, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and other groups. These attendees were tasked with mapping the future of nursing regulation in the following categories: (a) governance, (b) processes, (c) licensure and registration, (d) workforce, (e) education, (f) fitness for practice, and (g) technology. The Regulation 2030 Conference identified data, collaboration, and standardization as major thematic requirements that would enable the evolution of nursing regulation. Specifically, participants imagined the harmonization of regulatory processes around the world, including the optimized capture and sharing of data across nations and continents. As a step toward future outcomes, and keeping with the recognition of data sharing, collaboration, and standardization as keys to delivering those outcomes, NCSBN determined that there was no efficient method for comparing the governance and processes by which nurses are regulated around the world. Therefore, a single resource containing data on the state of nursing regulation in each country that was digital, searchable, and allowed easy comparison across jurisdictions was needed. This resource ultimately became known as the Global Regulatory Atlas. This special issue, ""Global Profile of Nursing Regulation, Education, and Practice,"" summarizes the rich data contained within Global Regulatory Atlas into an enlightening anthology that captures the similarities, differences and details of nursing around the world. A Glossary of frequently used terms in the Atlas and in this report is included in Appendix A. This data is presented in two parts. Part I reports data and findings from a global perspective. Part II reports this data from a regional perspective. Note that some jurisdictions or regions do not have data listed in every category for various reasons, including that the data were not available or collected and documented in their region."

In addition , a draft measure issued in September 2018 would prohibit foreign television shows in prime time .	China's restrictions in the area of theater services have discouraged investment by foreign suppliers, and China's restrictions on services associated with television and radio greatly limit participation by foreign suppliers. For example, China prohibits retransmission of foreign television channels (except in high-end hotels), prohibits foreign investment in television stations and channels in China, and imposes highly restrictive quotas on the amount of foreign programming that can be shown on a Chinese over-the-air television channel each day. In addition, a draft measure issued in September 2018 would prohibit foreign television shows in prime time. China also prohibits foreign companies from providing film production and distribution services in China. The United States also remains very concerned about the impact of online publishing rules issued by State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) and MIIT in February 2016 on the ability of foreign companies to engage in the online distribution of videos and entertainment software, as these rules prohibit foreign companies from operating online distribution platforms in China. More recently, the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) issued a problematic draft measure that would impose new restrictions in China's already highly restricted market for foreign creative content on over-the-air television, cable television and online audiovisual-content platforms. This draft 110 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS measure would require that a broadcasting institution's spending on foreign content account for no more than 30 percent of its total available programs in each of several categories, including foreign movies, television shows, cartoons, documentaries and other foreign TV programs.

When I visit poverty-stricken villages with no access to clean drinking water , it gladdens my heart to see a lady health visitor , to see a working woman amidst the unfortunate surroundings .	And Pakistani women are playing a significant role in defusing the population bomb in Pakistan. One hundred thousand women are to be trained to reduce Pakistan's population growth levels and its infant mortality levels. When I visit poverty-stricken villages with no access to clean drinking water, it gladdens my heart to see a lady health visitor, to see a working woman amidst the unfortunate surroundings. For it is my conviction that we can conquer poverty, squalor, illiteracy and superstition only when we invest in our women and when our women begin working - begin working in our far-flung villages where time seems to have stood still and where the bullock not the tractor is still used for cultivation; where women are weak from bearing too many children; where the daughters are more malnourished than the sons, for the daughters get to eat the leftovers; where villagers work night and day with their women and children, to eke out an existence; where floods and rain wash out crops and destroy homes; where poverty stalks the land with an appetite that cannot be controlled until we wake up to the twin reality of population control and women's empowerment. And it is here that the United Nations and its Secretary-General have played a critical role. -194- Some cynics argue about the utility of holding this Conference. Let me disagree with them. The holding of this Conference demonstrates that women are not forgotten, that the world cares. The holding of this Conference demonstrates solidarity with women. The holding of this Conference makes us determined to contribute each in our own way, in any manner we can, to lessen the oppression, repression and discrimination against women. While much needs to be done, each decade has brought with it its own small improvement.

Raising productivity in agriculture requires developing a rural workforce of better-educated farmers .	While most new jobs in the near future are expected to be generated outside agriculture, it currently occupies four out of five rural workers and close to half of the total labor force. Raising productivity in agriculture requires developing a rural workforce of better-educated farmers. Better-educated farmers are more likely to adopt modern farm inputs and technologies, make better use of purchased inputs and labor, choose technologies more effectively, and respond rapidly to changes in markets (Schultz 1988; Filmer et al. 2014). Improving the levels of basic educational attainment, through the development of reading, writing, and numeracy skills among the rural workforce, the efficacy of agricultural training can be significantly improved. And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture, the demand for schooling and more technical skills will rise. This will include the ability to use digital technology to access and interpret information as it may be transformative in how farmers learn to interact optimally with markets and receive information, such as weather predictions, that impact their farming decisions (Box 6.1).

There is also a risk of focusing on industries that are not in line with the potential comparative advantage of these regions.40 Combined with poor logistics and weak government capacity, that could mean that few manufacturing jobs would actually migrate to these regions.

Worksheet Name: This is the name of the worksheet, which is found in the tabs at the bottom of the National Footprint Accounts template. 5.2.1 Ef_crop Level 2 (Only cropland worksheet at this level) Ef_crop summarizes the cropland Footprints of Production, Import, Export, and Consumption. Layout: This worksheet begins with one identifying column. The 'Name' column reports the names of the considered groups of products summarized in this worksheet: 'crop products,' 'cropland in livestock,' and 'unharvested cropland.' This identifying column is followed by four columns that report the Footprints of Production ('EFP'), Imports ('EFI'), Exports ('EFE'), and Consumption ('EFC') for each products' group. Data and Calculation: For the 'crop products' group, the 'EFP', 'EFI', and 'EFE' columns report values directly from the Level 3 worksheets, crop_efp, crop_efi, and crop_efe, respectively. For the 'cropland in livestock' group, two grazing land-related Level 3 worksheets, livestock_efi and livestock_efe, are used as value sources for the 'EFI', and 'EFE' columns. These worksheets are used to estimate the amount of cropland embodied in traded livestock. For the 'unharvested cropland' group, the 'EFP' column reports values to adjust for the land locally left fallow. Finally, for each group, the 'EFC' column is calculated using the Equation 2_1. The final row in the ef_crop table totals the Footprints of Production, Imports, Exports, and Consumption to obtain total Footprints for the crop land use type. The total Footprint of Production for the 'crop products' group is calculated by summing only the Footprint of Production of primary products to avoid double counting. The total Footprint of Consumption is calculated by applying Equation 2_1 to the total EFP, EFI, and EFE.

The nature of those jobs varies with the characteristics of the country , including its phase of development , demography , endowments , and institutions .	Data and analysis can be used to identify misaligned incentives, indicated by a gap between the individual and the social value of jobs. Several research areas deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can measure the tax burden that applies to capital and labor and assess the crosssubsidization between individuals or firms. The methods of labor economics can uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings, or between the social and individual returns to schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on reducing poverty. Productivity studies allow for quantifying the spillovers from employment in foreign-owned investment companies, or in cities. Environmental studies shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs. And valA simple approach to setting policy priorities follows five steps (figure 19): * Step one: What are good jobs for development? Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities. The nature of those jobs varies with the characteristics of the country, including its phase of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges are not the same in agrarian economies, resource-rich countries, conflict-affected countries, or in countries with high youth unemployment. And the jobs with the greatest development impact differ as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. * Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under way, the development value of new manufacturing jobs might materialize. But it might not if, for example, inadequate urbanization policies limit the establishment of new firms.

A recent report by the United Nations Environmental Programme found that many major industries, including tobacco, would not be profitable if they paid for the environmental impacts of their manufacturing (114, 115). There are 560 cigarette manufacturing facilities in the world, producing more than 6 trillion cigarettes every year (by 2009, 2.3 trillion of these were being manufactured in China (116)). There is also the environmental cost of manufacturing other smoked forms of tobacco such as cigars and bidis - the impact of which is not yet fully documented.

Dissemination of findings , however , through both traditional and newer forms of media , offer opportunities for academic research on migration to inform public and policy discourses .	In summary, our quantitative analysis shows that migration as a topic is receiving increasing attention: the growing number of publications and citations are a sign of heightened interest, at least within the academic community. Measures of views/downloads and Altmetrics suggest that there is room for improving the reach and readership of scholarly production on migration. One of the main obstacles to this is the fact that academic publications tend to be behind paywalls, significantly limiting access to material beyond academia. Journal subscribers, for example, are often academic institutions, and the cost of downloading single articles 43 IOM, 2017e. 146 Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions for non-subscribers can be prohibitive. Open access for academic publications enables free downloads, but usually requires publisher fees to be paid by the author or their institution. More open-access journals (such as Comparative Migration Studies and Anti-Trafficking Review) have, however, been publishing on migration.44 In addition, academic language and writing style tend to be more technical than in other areas of publishing, and the topics tend to be narrower. Dissemination of findings, however, through both traditional and newer forms of media, offer opportunities for academic research on migration to inform public and policy discourses.

The garment industry in Bangladesh illustrates how important it is to learn advanced management practices, marketing, and technologies from abroad. When Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up with Bangladesh's Desh Ltd. to produce garments for export in Bangladesh in 1979, the South Asian country had no modern industry. Little more than 20 years later, the industry was generating more than US$12.5 billion in export revenue. Women accounted for 80 percent of its 3.6 million workers Arguably, a wide set of factors, from financial innovation to policy support, contributed to this development success. But it began in 1979, when Desh sent 130 newly recruited, educated employees to Daewoo's garment factory in Korea, where they participated in an eight-month intensive training course covering topics from sewing skills to factory management, quality control, and international procurement and marketing--skills that they then applied in the Desh factories in Bangladesh. Within a few years, almost all the trainees had left Desh to start their own garment businesses. Some of the ex-Desh workers joined new garment factories established by affluent businessmen, while others founded trading houses, which then BOX 3.4 What explains the boom in the garment industry in Bangladesh? contributed to the proliferation of garment manufacturers by providing a variety of valuable services including international procurement and marketing, sample making, and design reengineering.

On the whole, the education of the worker and the circumstances he or she was born into play important roles in explaining inequalities in access to jobs, and the role of education is especially important for regular employment in the formal sector.50 * * * The interaction of jobs and social cohesion is not linear or simple to disentangle. This is an emerging area for further research across disciplines. The effect of jobs on trust and civic engagement at the individual level suggests that exchanges The exclusionary nature of networks is highlighted by the experience of migrants moving from rural areas to cities. Migrants often choose destinations where they have connections. But if they do not, they can be uprooted from family and community ties that provide economic and social support, including access to jobs. They may also lack the information needed to integrate into their new destinations. Migrants moving across borders or regions, internally displaced persons or refugees fleeing from conflict or returning after a peace agreement, and soldiers demobilized after conflict may be particularly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportunities. This is a concern in conflict situations as well as in contexts of structural transformation, when massive numbers of people move from rural to urban areas.45 Networks also do not reach many among the self-employed, especially home-based workers who work in isolation and domestic workers who lack opportunities to interact with others.

The overall research approach at Virginia Tech has been multi-disciplinary, in close collaboration with the Host Country Project Team. In Senegal, three departments were involved in this project: (1) Department of Food Science for the analysis of aflatoxin levels in peanut on farm, in storage, and in the markets; and review of food preparation practices; (2) Department of Agronomy on farming, harvesting, and post-harvest practices related to minimizing aflatoxin contamination; and (3) Social Sciences Department on gender analysis of farming and related activities, experimental methodologies for health education, and gender and health training. In 2002, farm level surveys were carried out in selected rural communities in Senegal to collect data on farming, post-harvest processing, storage, and health issues related to aflatoxin. The survey involved first year students from ENEA who collected data as part of their official activities; a report was prepared in 2003. Due to slow progress, the project was transferred to Uganda in June 2003 and project coordination was transferred to the Department of Food Science and Technology at Makerere University in Kampala. A field-level mini-survey was carried out in May 2003 in three villages to collect farming and post-harvest practices related to peanuts and aflatoxin. The survey was carried out by two Virginia Tech Teams and the Makerere University coordinator. Then a farm-level survey was carried out in 2003-2004 in four villages in the peanut growing areas of Uganda (in Mubende, Iganga, and Mayuge Districts) to assess the aflatoxin level in peanuts which was initially determined to be high by the IPM CRSP team. The survey carried out by a Ugandan graduate student. Another survey was carried out in 2003-04 on knowledge, attitudes, and practices of peanut traders, wholesalers and retailers in Uganda, in selected markets in Uganda.

For processed meat products , an assessment is conducted by both the Undersecretary of Commercialization and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development , resulting in unnecessary redundancy and delay .	Ecuador imposes a variety of standards-related measures on certain types of processed food. Executive Decree No. 4522 of 2013 of the Ministry of Public Health's (MSP) National Agency for Regulation, 144 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Control, and Sanitary Surveillance, requires that all processed and packaged food products include a label with a set of colored bars indicating low, medium, or high content of salt, sugar, and fat. Although the government of Ecuador revoked in November 2018 a resolution, COMEX 116, that would require a certificate demonstrating compliance with the labeling provisions, it remains unclear what a transition phase will look like for labeling and conformity assessment of imported food and agricultural products. Implementation of this requirement reduced the imports of dozens of high value added food products from the United States, including preserved meat and vegetable products, jams, sauces, and other food products, because certification is more onerous for imports than for domestic products. In addition, processed food products of animal origin require prior authorization from three government agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, including the animal and plant health authority AGROCALIDAD, the Undersecretary of Commercialization, and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development. For processed meat products, an assessment is conducted by both the Undersecretary of Commercialization and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development, resulting in unnecessary redundancy and delay. The United States will continue to work with Ecuadorian authorities to explore alternatives, including the use of state or federal Certificates of Free Sale, a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity, or a determination of equivalence with the Ecuadorian Service for Standardization's (INEN) requirements.

The development process is about some jobs becoming better and others disappearing , about people taking jobs and changing jobs , and about jobs migrating to other places within and across countries .	Jobs are transformational PART1 Introduction to Part 1 Economic development is about improvements in living standards supported by productivity growth. It also involves social change associated with urbanization, integration in the world economy, and the drive toward gender equality. All of these transformations are related to jobs. The development process is about some jobs becoming better and others disappearing, about people taking jobs and changing jobs, and about jobs migrating to other places within and across countries. Development often entails the movement of labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly subsistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and mostly market-oriented activities. This movement transforms the lives of families and communities, the organization of firms, and the norms and values of societies. It can boost productivity and improve living standards and also affect the cohesiveness of society. Jobs are thus a key driver of development. * Living standards: Jobs provide earnings opportunities to lift people out of poverty, raise their consumption, and contribute to individual well-being more broadly. * Productivity: Through job creation and destruction within sectors and reallocations across sectors and countries, jobs are also at the root of economic growth. * Social cohesion: Jobs define who people are in many ways; by shaping values and be-DEVELOPMENT JOBS LIVING STANDARDS PRODUCTIVITY SOCIAL COHESION haviors, they can influence trust and civic engagement.

Food safety / health and nutrition research should be of high priority due to its high potential for global impacts on health and well-being of people , but is more costly than traditional agriculture programs .	1. Based on the significant achievements, impacts, and benefits of the present program and the constraints still confronting the peanut sector in the host countries and the U.S.A., the EEP strongly recommends that the Peanut CRSP be continued into a third ten-year phase. 2. The Peanut CRSP is addressing the whole value chain of an important food and cash crop and this should continue in the future. The holistic approach contributed to the success of the program relative to the resources provided by USAID and it facilitated the leveraging of funds by U.S.A. and host country participating institutions. 3. Food safety/health and nutrition research should be of high priority due to its high potential for global impacts on health and well-being of people, but is more costly than traditional agriculture programs. Hence, higher funding level is needed for this important research area that is pioneered by Peanut CRSP, and that bridges health and agriculture concerns. 4. The future program should include the full range of production, post-harvest, utilization, and market development projects in each host country or region to insure that product value-addition is addressed early and that the producers also benefit through better market elasticity. 5. Socio-economic projects should cut across all projects to ensure inclusion of research to provide baseline information for later impact analyses, economic viability of technologies, policy interventions, market information, and risk management for improved decision-making. It is recommended that to continue the progress towards achieving the goal of better gender equity, adequate resources to plan, monitor, and evaluate social and gender concerns within and across projects.. 6. Information exchange and networking mechanisms, collaboration with other research stakeholders, and training should continue as core functions of the program. Management should continue to promote collaboration and efficient use of resources within the program. 7. Continue the development of partnerships to facilitate transfer of technologies to beneficiaries and other stakeholders. Strong collaboration between the components of a project cluster and across countries in a geographic region should be fostered in the future.

Entering Tunisia's domestic market, particularly the services sector, remains difficult for foreign investors. Foreign investment is limited to 49 percent in many sectors, and the process of investing is particularly challenging in areas that are not government priorities (i.e., where there are no public tenders). Under Tunisia's investment code, high-value joint ventures with a foreign investor must be approved by the Tunisian government, which assesses the potential benefit of the investment to the Tunisian economy. Investors in Tunisia frequently complain of delays, lack of transparency regarding rules and fees, competition from state-owned enterprises, and other bureaucratic complications in the process of registering a business. Provisions in Tunisian commercial legislation designed to protect minority shareholder interests confer disproportionate influence on Tunisian minority partners. On April 1, 2017, a new Tunisian Investment Law intended to facilitate increased foreign investment into Tunisia took effect. In May 2018, the government adopted ministerial decree No. 417, publishing a list of 100 economic activities in sectors requiring government authorization for investment.

Therefore , in attempting to avoid catastrophic resource depletion , continually improving technology is assumed .	In 1971, Paul R. Ehrlich and John P. Holdren released a seminal work that decomposed the anthropogenic driving forces of natural capital appropriation into three variables: Population, Affluence, and Technology (Ehrlich & Holdren, 1971). This model came to be known as the IPAT model (Environmental Impact = Population * Affluence * Technology), and remains a useful framework for examining environmental impact. Although all three factors are likely to be limiting in the long run, modern societies usually try to increase affluence and many attempt to maintain continuous population growth.

The transmission elasticity from energy to non-energy, and agricultural commodities has been estimated at 0.11-0.25.13 Based on these estimates, a 45 percent decline in oil prices is associated with an almost 10 percent decline in the prices of agricultural commodities. 13 A number of studies report strong linkages between the prices of energy and non-energy commodities in the context of different commodities using a variety of methodologies (Gilbert 1989; Hanson, Robinson, and Schluter 1993; Borensztein and Reinhart 1994; Chaudhuri 2001; Baffes 2007 and 2010; Moss, Livanis, and Schmitz 2010). Some others find no direct causal link between the prices of energy and non-energy commodities (Saghaian 2010; Gilbert 2010; Zhang et al. 2010; Reboredo 2012.

As a source of working capital financing, factoring is of particular interest for high-risk and informationally non-transparent firms, as well as firms with a solid base of customers but high investments in intangible assets, which cannot be used to secure bank loans. This is because the factor primarily evaluates the creditworthiness of the firm's customers and the validity of invoices, rather than the firm's financial statements, its fixed collateralisable assets or credit history. Hence, factoring may be especially advantageous for a SME that has difficulties in accessing bank lending but supplies larger customers, which are seen as more creditworthy than the firm itself. Milenkovic-Kerkovic and Dencic-Mihajlov (2012) underline in particular the advantages of factoring for service firms, which tend to be payrollintensive, have usually little proper collateral that can be used to secure traditional bank loan, and may have high investments in intangible assets, which are not always reflected in financial statements. 98. Factoring may also represent an instrument of choice to manage credit risk when the seller has a very sparse specialised investment in its customers and the cost of monitoring them is high (Smith and Schnucker, 1994). This can be the case also for customers located overseas, when export or international factoring is used. Through factoring, the seller outsources the monitoring functions and may indeed consider acceptance of invoices by the factor as a signal of its customers' creditworthiness. 99. Factoring is also useful for firms that grow faster than their credit lines, as, similarly to assetbased finance, it provides greater flexibility than conventional loans. In fact, as each account receivable is evaluated individually, in the event of increased sales, new receivables can be sold rapidly to a factor and the advanced cash used to respond to new orders. 100. As the extension of working capital does not depend on the firm's credit history, factoring can also serve the needs of new and young companies. At the same time, however, start-ups with low turnover may be little attractive to factors, as they are often too small, have an inadequate customer base and lack a track record in sales and economic management (Soufani, 2001).	As a source of working capital financing, factoring is of particular interest for high-risk and informationally non-transparent firms, as well as firms with a solid base of customers but high investments in intangible assets, which cannot be used to secure bank loans.

"Jobs and social cohesion 135 likely to witness ethnic violence, while riots were more frequent in cities with fewer economic ties. The existence of civil society organizations, such as clubs, political parties, labor unions, and business associations, contributed to reducing violence. But economic interests provided a common motivation for community members of both groups to participate in these associations.37 Jobs can also play a connecting role outside of urban environments. Studies in Ghana and Uganda illustrate how farmers connected through networks can access information and increase productivity. In Ghana, pineapple farmers adjusted their use of fertilizer in response to the successful or unsuccessful experiences of their neighbors. Farmers who were starting to cultivate pineapples were more likely to make changes based on information they had received from other farmers, showing the potential that on-the-job interactions and learning from others can have.38 In a qualitative survey, youth in Ghana who were asked about the characteristics that would make a job attractive emphasized the importance of jobs as opportunities to meet new people and build social networks.39 and the workplace in the United States finds that cross-cutting interactions at work lead to greater awareness of the rationales for views other than one's own and for ""exposing people to political dialogue across lines of political difference.""33 In a survey of 200 managers, owners, and sales representatives in Trinidad and Tobago, 81 percent of the interviewees reported that their working lives brought them into contact with people of a wider range of races than did their social lives.34 Interactions through jobs can contribute to greater trust and positive interdependence between groups. In the 18th century, Montesquieu wrote that ""the natural effect of commerce is to bring peace. Two nations that negotiate between themselves become reciprocally dependent, if one has an interest in buying and the other in selling.""35 Relations through jobs, whether built through trade or other transactions, can influence social relations."

Power failures are frequent , many roads are unpaved , and those that are paved are highly congested .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

Obtaining a health certificate for the purpose of food product registration is problematic as this document only accompanies actual shipments of meat or processed meat products .	"El Salvador requires a ""Certificate of Free-Sale"" to register food products. The Ministry of Health has agreed to accept the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) 9060-5 certificate for meat and meat products in lieu of the Certificate of Free-Sale. However, the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) requires an original FSIS 9060-5 certificate (health certificate) for U.S. meat and meat products. Obtaining a health certificate for the purpose of food product registration is problematic as this document only accompanies actual shipments of meat or processed meat products. These shipments cannot occur until the food product is registered. Under the CAFTA-DR, El Salvador granted equivalence to the U.S. sanitary inspection system for beef, pork, and poultry and poultry products, making this requirement unnecessarily burdensome to U.S. exports. In 2015, El Salvador issued the implementing regulation for the Act for the Promotion, Protection and Support of Breast Feeding, which defines requirements for sanitary registration, restricts marketing and advertising, and sets out labeling requirements for breast milk substitutes. This measure was published and entered into force in 2015, without notification to the WTO, and lacks clarity as to what information must appear on the label. At least one U.S. company doing business in El Salvador has expressed concerns about the measure. The United States is monitoring the implementation of the measure and has requested El Salvador notify it to the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Committee to allow WTO Members a comment period and reasonable interval for implementation."

Additionally , Ghana 's ports suffer from congested roads and lack a functioning rail system to transport freight , creating long waits for ships to berth at cargo terminals and for containers to be transported out of the ports .	"Ghanaian customs practices and port infrastructure continue to present major obstacles to trade. Officials have introduced risk-management approaches, such as the Pre-Arrival Assessment Reporting System. However, the majority of imports are still subject to inspection on arrival, causing delays and increased costs. Importers report erratic application of customs and other import regulations, lengthy clearance procedures, and corruption. The resulting delays can contribute to product deterioration and result in significant losses for importers of perishable goods. Additionally, Ghana's ports suffer from congested roads and lack a functioning rail system to transport freight, creating long waits for ships to berth at cargo terminals and for containers to be transported out of the ports. Ghana Ports and Harbor Authority (GPHA) is working to modernize both the Ports of Tema and Takoradi. In November 2016, Ghana launched a $1.5 billion public-private partnership between GPHA and Meridian Port Services, a partnership representing interests from the Netherlands and France, to quadruple the capacity of the Tema Port. This port expansion project is expected to be completed in 2019. Ghana has launched several initiatives over the past couple of years to support online information and processing of trade transactions, including the development of a National Single Window. In September 2017, Ghana introduced electronic (""paperless"") cargo clearance at ports to reduce clearance times. The Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has taken on the inspection and valuation role once occupied by five licensed destination inspection companies, which many believed were the source of the long clearance delays. However, the one percent fee associated with the inspections is still collected."

It also has rich cultural assets , including a strong sports and entertainment tradition .	South America scores slightly less than the North and Central America and global averages but improved its competitiveness at a much faster rate. The subregion has the highest rating for natural resources in the world and is known for its abundant wildlife. It also has rich cultural assets, including a strong sports and entertainment tradition. Helping facilitate the flow of visitors to these and other destination points are above-average tourism service infrastructure, international openness and price competitiveness, which is the subregion's most improved area. Given these strengths, however, South America has a relatively small T&T economy, defined by disproportionally low international tourist arrivals, which helps to explain the subregion's dependence on domestic T&T markets. This can be due to South America's underdeveloped air and ground transport infrastructure--which undermines accessibility--with ground infrastructure being the subregion's greatest disadvantage relative to the global average. Moreover, South America scores lowest for business environment, deterring T&T investment, and has poor safety conditions, which is a particularly important consideration for international travellers. South America also has below-average environmental sustainability, caused primarily by deforestation, habitat loss and relatively lax environmental regulation and enforcement, potentially explaining its declining lead on natural resources. Yet the region has made strides to mitigate these drawbacks, with performance on all relevant pillars improving since the previous report. Additionally, the subregion's lead related to openness and price competitiveness also increased.	It also has rich cultural assets, including a strong sports and entertainment tradition.

Production : This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming , livestock and fisheries , and autonomy in agricultural production , with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment .	The early literature on empowerment typically used one global measure for empowerment. For example, parents' education was often used to measure agency or decision-making within the household (Alkire 2007); husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981). However, it is possible that agency differs across different spheres of life and can exist simultaneously in different ways. For example, a person can be fully employed as a wife and mother, excluded from the labor force by social conventions, and recently empowered to vote by political processes. Because such distinctions have policy relevance, it is important to identify and compare agency achievements in different domains rather than in one alone (Alkire 2007, 166). Because agency and empowerment are experienced with different tasks and can be described and measured with different domains, Alkire (2005) suggests that most measures of agency and empowerment should be domain specific. For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1. Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment. 2. Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit. 3. Income: This dimension concerns sole or joint control over the use of income and expenditures. 4. Leadership: This dimension concerns leadership in the community, here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public. 5. Time: This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities.	Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment.

In Boliva : There are two factors that contributed to the significant progress in the peanut program in Bolivia .	In Boliva: There are two factors that contributed to the significant progress in the peanut program in Bolivia. ANAPO plays a key role in technology transfer and seed production. The first factor is ANAPO's strong linkages to technology transfer agencies such as the development foundations (FDTA) Project UFL16P - 201 - funded by a group of donors and farmers' associations. The foundations receive funding from a multidonor group called SIBTA (System for Bolivian Agricultural Technology) implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture. ANAPO has been contracted by the government through the development foundations to provide technologies and advisory services to small-scale producers. ANAPO and its partners have conducted numerous meetings and farmer training sessions in Bolivia. Men and women farmers have benefited from field days (i.e., recent Peanut Summit/Tour held in February 2005 and attended by over 100 farmers in the FDTA-Valles region), extension publications and growers' training manuals, and demonstration of simple equipment for harvesting, threshing, and grading. Scientists and technical support staff have benefited from workshops. Presently, FDTA-Valles/ANAPO is in three areas of the Valles Region, but they plan expand activities into the Chaco Region in 2005. Improved varieties introduced by ANAPO occupy about one-half of the production in the Valles Region. The second factor is the development of a Peanut Seed Production Program. Seed multiplication activities are implemented by ANAPO, a private association of farmers with seed multiplication responsibilities) have particularly good potential for technology transfer (quality seed and new cultivars). ANAPO sells certified seeds of improved varieties to farmers, facilitating the diffusion of new varieties quickly, one of the bottlenecks in many developing countries. Eight varieties are being multiplied, and counter-season production will speed up the process. In the United States. In the U.S., the Georgia Peanut Commission has shown keen interest in the collaborative project in Bolivia. Commission members have participated in field days. The Chairperson of the GPC Research Committee has shown particular interest and has been very supportive of the Peanut CRSP activities in Bolivia.

While the nation 's enabling environment ( 22nd ) is strong relative to the global average , it trails subregional competition .	Most of the subregion's nations enhanced their T&T competitiveness since the last report. Denmark is the region's most improved economy, climbing 10 places to rank 21st globally, thanks to a significant improvement on air transport infrastructure (44th to 29th) and price competitiveness, although it's still one of the world's most expensive countries (131st). Norway has Northern Europe's largest and most competitive T&T economy, but also experienced the largest decline in overall score (18th to 20th). Like much of the subregion, the country scores well in areas related to the overall enabling environment (8th), infrastructure (22nd) and prioritization of T&T (19th). However, Norway stands out for exceptional air transport infrastructure (5th), due to high airport (4th) and departure density, leading environmental sustainability (2nd) and above subregion average natural resources (51st). Nevertheless, the nation's Natural Resources pillar score dropped 21 places as recalibrated protected area data proved less favourable (100th). Natural tourism digital demand also fell (10th to 21st), as did scores related to business environment (10th to 20th) and safety and security (7th to 17th). Despite improvement, Lithuania still dropped three spots to 59th, keeping it as the least-competitive country in the subregion. While the nation's enabling environment (22nd) is strong relative to the global average, it trails subregional competition.

The process of assessing existing laws and policies should involve all stakeholders, including organizations of persons with disabilities, and should be based on information about health inequalities as well as evidence-based assessments of the gaps in health-care service delivery and of the policy and legal barriers to accessing health-care services. To legally ensure access to health-care services, and because of the wide range of accessibility issues that need to be addressed, national strategies should ensure wider, general protections to the right to the highest standard of health, either through constitutional, anti-discrimination or other national disability legislation, and then pursue the detailed accessibility issues by means of regulations and guidelines at the community level. 2) Identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers to accessibility in health-care facilities.

In Portugal, by contrast, not all born large. In industrial countries, some of the more resounding successes, from Honda to Microsoft, started in garages. And many successful companies in developing countries also grew out of small household businesses. Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Group, founded in 1921 as a small seed shop in Bangkok by two brothers, has grown into one of the world's largest multinational conglomerates in agribusiness, operating in 15 countries and encompassing close to 100 companies.48 India's Tata Group transformed from a Mumbai-based, familyowned trading firm in the late 19th century to Sources: Cabral and Mata 2003; Sandefur 2010.

The ACC Act as well as follow up policy documents and other reports have all recognised that supporting agencies ( the Judiciary as well as the Police ) have to play a strong role in the success of the ACC , yet the relationship between these agencies is still a matter of concern .	Joint Evaluation of Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts - Bangladesh 32 * Past and present TA support was criticised for not being sufficiently grounded in the Bangladesh context and instead drew too extensively on models elsewhere (such as Singapore and Hong Kong). 5.9. A main lesson emerging from Bangladesh is that donors, alongside the caretaker government, moved too fast in revitalising a moribund ACC, when concomitant support to investigation and prosecution by police and judiciary was needed. That approach was partly implicit in the support through the ADB GGP (See Box 4.1) - but in the case of Bangladesh there is still much discord between the various parties, and the efforts of the ACC are regularly frustrated by the lack of support. 5.10. Given the existence of a revitalised ACC, more attention should have been paid to its interactions and linkages with other key institutions. The ACC Act as well as follow up policy documents and other reports have all recognised that supporting agencies (the Judiciary as well as the Police) have to play a strong role in the success of the ACC, yet the relationship between these agencies is still a matter of concern. 5.11. The emerging view that some of the ACC actions under the caretaker government may have been politically motivated has also weakened the ACC. This, combined with fluctuating government support for the ACC over the evaluation period, shows that in practice the ACC still lacks political clout and independence from the executive.56 5.12. The politicisation of ACC as a public institution and the uncertainty that come with it was the main reason given by donors (including DFID) for not supporting its AC work. This has left the ADB vulnerable to criticism as the sole donor of support in a politically-sensitive context. As explained in previous Chapters, although all donors applauded the caretaker government's commitment to AC, only Denmark and ADB came forward to support the ACC - with Denmark support being narrowly targeted TA. Furthermore, Danida TA support had not yet begun by the end of 2009, despite Danida funds having been transferred to ADB.	The ACC Act as well as follow up policy documents and other reports have all recognised that supporting agencies (the Judiciary as well as the Police) have to play a strong role in the success of the ACC, yet the relationship between these agencies is still a matter of concern.

Selected Country/Economy Analysis The United States is the top scorer in the Americas, moving up one place to rank fifth globally. The combination of the overall size of its economy and T&T competitiveness helps explain why the country has the largest T&T GDP in the world, accounting for over one-fifth of the global total. In comparison to the global average, one of the United States' greatest advantages comes from its natural (5th) and cultural (12th) resources, which also helps separate it from many other developed nations in the rankings. The country is well known for its numerous World Heritage natural sites (3rd) and extensive wildlife (13th), which drive nature-based tourist arrivals (35th). The flow of travellers is assisted by excellent air transport (3rd) and tourist services (4th) infrastructure and increasingly efficient ground transport (17th to 6th). However, the primary reason for the United States' improvement is its better enabling environment (25th to 16th), including enhancements to already-strong business environment (16th to 4th) and human resource and labour market (13th to 1st) areas.

Developing country deltas are important food producing areas and are home to large numbers of subsistence farmers .	"Developing country deltas are important food producing areas and are home to large numbers of subsistence farmers. In particular, rice farmers dominate the populous deltas of South and Southeast Asia and face frequent climate hazards that have shortand long-term impacts on rice production and livelihoods. The aim of this study is to identify and explain proximal and ultimate factors (land access, cultural practices, and institutional support) that affect rice farmer resilience, that is, to explain why some farmers are more sensitive to climate shocks, why some farmers suffer long-term impacts from climate shocks, and what underlying ""ultimate"" factors reproduce this vulnerability over time. We undertake this analysis using qualitative interviews and household survey data from two districts in the Mahanadi Delta, Odisha, India. We show that climate hazards cause rice production shocks that are problematic for farmers because rice is predominantly used for household consumption in a context of unreliable off-farm income sources and a lack of insurance and credit. Our research emphasizes that ""ultimate"" drivers interact with the current mode of rice cultivation to reproduce a low resilience farming state. We argue that agricultural development interventions seeking to make rice farming more resilient to climate hazards should focus on boosting productivity and shock-resistance, but also be cognizant of the system within which rice farming is practiced and the contextual ""ultimate"" factors that reproduce vulnerability."

"It should be noted that IUCN's members adopted a recommendation at the World Conservation Congress in Amman, Jordan in October 2000, which suggested that mining should not take place in IUCN category I-IV protected areas.

If the impacts of transboundary air pollution and climate change are factored in, the entire planet has been modified. It therefore follows that terms such as ""natural"" and ""cultural"" are approximations. To some extent we could describe all protected areas as existing in ""cultural"" landscapes in that cultural practices will have changed and influenced ecology, often over millennia. However, this is little help in distinguishing between very different types of ecosystem functioning.

As jobs provide earnings, generate output, and influence identity, they shape the wellbeing of those who hold them--and they also affect the well-being of others. To understand how much jobs contribute to development, it is necessary to assess these effects--the spillovers from jobs. Jobs that generate positive spillovers have a greater value to society than they have to the individual who holds the job, while the opposite is true when spillovers are negative. Intuitively, many people have notions about such broader payoffs. When asked about their most preferred jobs, respondents in China, Colombia, Egypt, and Sierra Leone give different answers from those they offer when asked to identify the most important jobs to society (figure 11). Working as a civil servant or as a shop owner is generally preferred by individuals, while teachers and doctors are quite often mentioned as the most important jobs for society.

These are still being developed and include various certification systems , institutionalized systems of declaration and peer pressure .	The IUCN definition of a protected area is clear that such areas should be managed for conservation in perpetuity and this is the main criterion that will distinguish whether a particular area of privately-owned land or water is or is not a protected area. A land owner who manages for conservation today but makes no provisions for whether or not the management will continue into the future is certainly contributing to conservation but not through a recognised protected area. Providing long-term security is one of the challenges facing private protected areas. Some national governments have addressed this through introducing legislation that makes declaration of a private protected area a legally-binding commitment over time although where this is not the case, other mechanisms may be necessary. These are still being developed and include various certification systems, institutionalized systems of declaration and peer pressure. Further work on steps needed to integrate private protected areas more fully into national and inter-national protected area systems is urgently needed. 4. Applying the categories This section describes the processes for applying categories, including: choosing and then agreeing the most suitable category for a given situation; assigning the category to meet national legal requirements and international standards and norms; and recording the protected area and category with the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre.

The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity , the less constrained the country is by domestic demand and the larger is its agriculture 's potential for generating jobs .	Fourth, global demand for Coted'Ivoire's agricultural export commodities points to continuing opportunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. The extent to which Engel's Law acts as a constraint on the demand for a country's agricultural products (and labor), depends also on the tradability of its agriculture, the evolution of global (as opposed to domestic) demand, and the country's comparative advantage. The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity, the less constrained the country is by domestic demand and the larger is its agriculture's potential for generating jobs. The production and export of cash crops, especially cocoa, but also of coffee, cotton, and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Coted'Ivoire's economy and job creation. They also feed other sectors of the economy, particularly agro-processing, commerce, and transportation and contribute importantly to formal wage job creation, many of them low skilled (Chapter5).

Box 3.4 Learning achievement of girls and boys The main purpose of any education system is to impart skills to young people so that they can effectively participate in the social, economic and political life. Getting children into school is not an end in itself. The ultimate measure of success is not only the extent to which children learn, but the quality of their education experience. Student assessment surveys provide a measure for assessing learning outcomes and the quality of education. Such surveys allow some assessment to be made of the relative achievements of girls and boys in terms of the subjects they study in school. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)--which surveys school performance among 15-yearolds around the world, particularly in reading, mathematics and science--makes it possible to measure disparities among and within countries in terms of the skills students attain after a given period of learning. Typically, this is done after about eight years of schooling, near the end of compulsory education in many countries.	The ultimate measure of success is not only the extent to which children learn, but the quality of their education experience.	The Worldâ€™s Women 2015: Trends and Statistics	United Nations	2015

In Afghanistan , poppy cultivation is an important source of income for rural households .	Conflict can fundamentally disrupt jobs by destroying or damaging infrastructure and access to markets, as well as through altering incentives. In Sri Lanka, conflict in the north disrupted economic activity and created favorable conditions for the insurgency to recruit among the newly unemployed.22 Even during war, however, people work. Jobs disproportionately involve low-pay or unpaid work, such as subsistence agriculture or petty trading. Youth in rural areas in post-conflict Liberia reported working two to four jobs at a time.23 Across countries, conflict increases fe - male labor force participation, as women work to help their households cope with income shocks and to compensate for the absence of men who are fighting (box 6.2).24 In Afghanistan, female employment rates were higher in high-conflict than in low-conflict areas; in Nepal, they increased more than in high-conflict areas.25 Some jobs in conflict-affected countries may involve illegal activities that persist in the aftermath of conflict because of weak governance and lack of legal alternatives. Even if these activities are limited in scope, they may undermine the creation of good jobs for development by distorting incentives and generating rents. In Afghanistan, poppy cultivation is an important source of income for rural households.26 In Somalia, piracy creates jobs for some through the employment of speed boat crews and related land-based operations.27 In Liberia, young people in rural areas have supplemented their income by working in illegal mining, rubber tapping, and logging.28 Jobs are central to recovery in countries emerging from conflict, but the barriers to job engine for employment creation? Moreover, countries affected by conflict are often poor to begin with. Their opportunities, resources, and capacity are scarce; data for planning may simply not exist.

The labor earnings of workers with tertiary education are double or more than those of workers with secondary education only .	The relatively lower wages among low-skill workers compared with high-skill workers, particularly in nontradable sectors in developing countries, are consistent with an increase in returns to education. Returns to education measure the wage premium on higher educational attainment for workers of the same sex with the same age and work experience. In all regions, more schooling is associated with higher labor earnings, but the gain is not linear. The labor earnings of workers with tertiary education are double or more than those of workers with secondary education only. However, workers with only a secondary education earn little more than those with elementary education. The education premium is generally higher the lower the income level of the country (figure 1.9).

There is substantial scope for modernization to take place in smallholder agriculture , including through mechanization .	Several policy entry points can be considered to maximize agriculture's contribution to the jobs agenda in Coted'Ivoire. First, continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Second, smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation, in particular as there are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones. There is substantial scope for modernization to take place in smallholder agriculture, including through mechanization. Third, Coted'Ivoire would need strong additional investments in agricultural research and development, including on staple crops. Fourth, low educational levels and poor training among actors in agricultural value chains hold technological innovation back. Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities. Finally, improving rural land tenure security and overcoming financing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses. This will often require a more integrated value chain approach where the government can play an important coordinating role.

Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors .	The movement of labor out of agriculture has been facilitated by close urban proximity, resulting from Bangladesh's high population density. Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors. The ready- Urbanizing countries Urbanizing countries endowed with abundant unskilled labor have the potential to enter a virtuous jobs circle. The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities, especially in light manufacturing. These jobs may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and limited or negligible benefits, but in general they are preferable to jobs in agriculture. They can also be the entry point to a process of economic and technological upgrading that leads to better jobs in the future.34 Employment opportunities for the unskilled thus provide avenues out of poverty for large numbers of households. In countries in which women's jobs choices have been restricted, new employment opportunities in urbanizing economies can bring about important changes at the household and society levels.

The extent to which foods indigenous to the New World today comprise an important portion of the world's diet is illustrated by Table 1, which reports the world's most popular foods in 2000. Thefirst list reports foods with popularity measured by the average consumption of calories per person per day. Because this measure may overstate the popularity of high-calorie food crops, we also provide rankings based on production and land under cultivation. These are reported in the second and third lists. Foods that are indigenous to the New World are reported in bold text. From the table it is clear that today New World foods are an important part of our diets.

Diversity matters: Many of the approaches used to prevent and respond to COVID-19 in the most affected areas thus far (e.g., China, Europe and the United States of America) will not be feasible in most humanitarian settings. Numerous humanitarian organizations are creating guidance and tools for the field, but there is a need for more evidence describing how such programs are being adapted according to varying contexts and socio-cultural settings. These adaptations and innovations need to be shared widely so others can learn from them and adopt or modify them according to their specific setting.Time constraint: On the platform, users can click on 'Share field experience' to provide inputs. However, knowing that humanitarian actors are busy in responding to COVID-19 and many will not have the time to respond, we have undertaken interviews with colleagues in the field, and then uploading the content to the website using the standardized forms. The three centres and their belonging universities are partners of the COVID-19 Humanitarian platform project. These provide sufficient research and administrative capacity. However, the nature of the project is to engage local partners to share their experience. In addition, partners with ideas on how to improve the flow of information from the field to the platform are of interest. The project is designed in a way to facilitate self-reporting, so organisations can continue to share their experiences and learning. The knowledge captured will be useful for professionals from the humanitarian sectors and health sectors as COVID-19 evolves and in future epidemics and crisis situations. It is also used for learning in the future in both sectors, as field based experiences can be synthesized and analysed to identify transferable lessons. As the project is with a global coverage, replication should avoid duplication and rather consider pooling efforts. Field experiences are collected and summarized in a standardized form to be ensure consistency when data is collected across many contexts.

The indiscriminate use of plastic sachets/pouches has become a new environmental concern in a number of countries where smokeless forms of tobacco such as gutkha, pan masala etc. are packaged and sold. The environmental, human and ecological damage of plastic waste materials, especially to marine biology, is well documented (136). The problem of using plastic pouches for packaging smokeless forms of tobacco was initially limited to south Asian economies, but in the last decade or so it has become a global concern.

When women attend school , they also have better chances of finding work and shaping their own lives .	There are two central points for intervention. And both make lives better. One of the greatest opportunities to increase human wellbeing is to slow down and eventually reverse population growth. This does not require coercive measures, in fact non-coercive ones are far more effective. And even more importantly, those investments make lives better, particularly for those who live in more fragile conditions today. Above all, this is the chance to invest in women, by giving them access to schooling, but also to family planning. This helps women to be more in control of their lives, and to contribute more effectively, for instance as community leaders or entrepreneurs. In many poorer parts of Africa, girls are excluded due to immediate economic hardship, and as a result poverty persists. When women attend school, they also have better chances of finding work and shaping their own lives. Their quality of life increases, as does that of their children and all other members of their family, men and women. Also, families become smaller. As a result there is more capacity for everyone living on limited resources. In the global economy it is beneficial for a country to have a gradually shrinking population. Many people think the opposite is true. They believe that competitiveness increases with a growing population. In an ecologically scarce world this no longer holds true.

Second , smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation , in particular as there are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones .	Several policy entry points can be considered to maximize agriculture's contribution to the jobs agenda in Coted'Ivoire. First, continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Second, smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation, in particular as there are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones. There is substantial scope for modernization to take place in smallholder agriculture, including through mechanization. Third, Coted'Ivoire would need strong additional investments in agricultural research and development, including on staple crops. Fourth, low educational levels and poor training among actors in agricultural value chains hold technological innovation back. Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities. Finally, improving rural land tenure security and overcoming financing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses. This will often require a more integrated value chain approach where the government can play an important coordinating role.

At the same time, transnational tobacco companies clearly respond to public outcry and pressure.

In countries with less oversight, this does not happen.

In January 2017, Ghana ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA). As a developing country Member of the WTO, Ghana availed itself of the implementation flexibilities in Section II of the TFA. However, Ghana has failed to notify its Category B commitments with indicative dates, which were due to the WTO Secretariat by entry into force of the Agreement, February 22, 2017, and its Category B definitive dates, which were due February 28, 2018. Ghana also has failed to designate the over 90 percent of its outstanding commitments in Section I of the Agreement. Ghana has yet to provide the relevant information regarding its indicative Category B or C notifications.

These coping strategies can be seen as symptoms of the absence of resilience ; ultimately a range of contextual factors interact to maintain this low-productivity , low-resilience state of rice farming .	Although the coping strategies undertaken by rice farmers partly contribute to the persistence of vulnerability, e.g., through depletion of assets, increases in, or maintenance of, debt, they do not fully explain why vulnerability occurs or persists. These coping strategies can be seen as symptoms of the absence of resilience; ultimately a range of contextual factors interact to maintain this low-productivity, low-resilience state of rice farming. These contextual factors undermine resilience in myriad ways often reinforcing low-return rice cropping that precludes wealth generation, necessitates coping, and does not provide farmers with resources to respond adequately to climate shocks. For example, the institutions governing land access mean many households operate small plots that do not generate sufficient returns because there is no surplus to sell. Thus small and insecure land holdings act as a break on income accrual and asset accumulation that can be used to smooth the impact of crop losses following climate hazards.

NovaSil as a feed additive (0.25% of the feed) binds aflatoxin and prevents adsorption, metabolism, and subsequent aflatoxicosis in animals. Research to transfer this to human application was added in this phase1. A study showed that lifetime exposure to NovaSil was harmless to rats. Based on these results, a human study was conducted in the U.S.A. that showed no adverse nutritional effects from consuming the clay.

The opposite holds for a job in an export industry that contributes to the acquisition of new technical and managerial knowledge from abroad and spreads it through interactions with suppliers ; this job is even more valuable to society when the jobholder is a woman and her work status empowers her .	Because a job can affect the well-being of others and not only the well-being of the jobholder, two jobs that may appear identical from an individual perspective could still be different from a social perspective. In a society that values poverty reduction, an informal job that takes a household out of poverty should be seen as more valuable to society.

For instance , traditional apprenticeship is one of the most prevalent source of training opportunities .	Ensuring access to skills upgrading opportunities for youths and adults who already exited the education system is challenging, particularly because so many have low educational attainment and limited skills to start with. For this subgroup, the role for public intervention is not necessarily confined to the direct provision of training. Facilitation of access and incentivizing of quality improvements in existing private training opportunities can be considered as well. For instance, traditional apprenticeship is one of the most prevalent source of training opportunities. Rather than replacing these traditional apprenticeships and attempting to set up a parallel publicly managed system, existing private informal apprenticeship arrangements could be leveraged. For example, the setup of certification frameworks allowing apprentices to take exams and become certified could be linked to financial incentives for trainers whose apprentices succeed at these exams. The setup of such an approach is not without challenges, but it would allow building on the widespread private apprenticeship system rather than attempting to replace it.

"The contractual arrangements, which may apply to both public sector and private employers, should reflect applicable regulatory and legislative frameworks in the jurisdiction.

This policy issue is particularly relevant for CHWs (151), as retention of these workers is problematic due to a variety of factors (152, 153).

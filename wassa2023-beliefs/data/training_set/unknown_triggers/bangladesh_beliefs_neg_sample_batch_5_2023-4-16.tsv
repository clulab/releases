"CHAPTER 9 - 254 Human mobility and adaptation to environmental change pressure - sometimes referred to as tipping points - after which remaining in situ becomes less attractive than leaving.6 Whether and when these intentions are manifested into actions is partially dependent on the material ability to move,7 with some immobile populations labelled as ""trapped"".8 Immobility is not necessarily related to material conditions, and also relates to psychological and cultural limitations and preferences.9 Numerous terms have been used to describe people who move as a result of environmental and climate change. This chapter uses terms such as ""human mobility"" in the context of climate change, which refers to a broad spectrum of people movement. It covers migration, displacement and planned relocation, as well as ""environmental migrants"", including in relation to extreme events and other environmental stressors. Three main framings of environmental migration and human mobility in the context of climate change have emerged in academia, the media and in policy circles: (a) irregular migration related to environmental change and resource shortages as a border security issue, particularly for areas of destination; (b) protection of environmental migrants; and (c) environmental migration as a form of adaptation and climate risk management (see table 1), reflecting the political sensitivities of migration."

More rapid achievement in private schools The Learning and Educational Achievements in Punjab Schools (LEAPS) project (2003-2007) covered 812 government and private schools in 112 villages, 12,000 school children, 2,000 households and 5,000 teachers. The project revealed that children in government schools take an average of one and a half years longer to reach the mathematical ability of their counterparts in private schools. For English skills the disparity can be as great as two and a half years. Using this as a benchmark, private schools clearly provide a better education and more effective teaching of English than public schools. Public schools suffer from lack of funding, meaning that English tuition is of lower quality. Although high-quality English tuition remains restricted to the wealthier parts of the population, the government is promoting countrywide usage of the language. As such, the gap in the cost of private and public education in Pakistan is pronounced.

The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits , as well as instrumental for educational work .	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where. This view of the world has proven to be sufficient for raising central questions and sparking the conversations that are needed to reverse current trends.

This would require an evidence-informed, intersectoral, participatory approach, the development and adoption of an accountability framework, and centring of global health diplomacy. By investing in evidence-informed interventions, States will be better equipped to develop responses to migration and health at the local, regional and global levels.

Currently , the police and the public attorney service , that is highly politicised , carry out prosecution .	Corruption is reported to be widespread at all levels. A household survey by TIB found that over 60% of the people who used the lower courts in 2004, paid a bribe, averaging at 25% of the average annual income.47 Funding of the courts for both resources and salaries is low compared to middle and high income countries in Asia, a factor which, according to TI, 'invites' corruption.48 The level of corruption is unclear. There have been no prosecutions of justice sector officers by the ACC as its preliminary focus has been on political figures and very few judges have been dismissed for corruption.49 Political and executive interference have created a crisis in the justice system. The judiciary gained independence from the executive only towards the end of the period under review despite a decision on appeal by the Supreme Court in 199950 directing that the separation mandated by the Constitution should take effect. Accordingly, executive control over the justice sector and the dual role of magistrates during the period created a risk of interference by the executive and the government in decisions and functioning of the justice sector.51 There is no independent prosecution service. The current government has not ratified an ordinance passed by the Caretaker Government creating one.

Although researchers in many jurisdictions were unable to gather these data, it was possible to determine that at least 52% (n = 167) of jurisdictions around the world allow nurses to prescribe medications or other types of treatment to some degree. In 37% (n = 117) of these jurisdictions, there is at least one nursing role with unrestricted prescribing authority. Similarly, 51% (n = 165) of jurisdictions allow diagnoses to be made by at least one type of nurse, although in many cases, these jurisdictions place restrictions on the type of diagnoses the authorized nurse may provide. Worldwide, 21% (n = 67) of jurisdictions permit RNs to diagnose, though often with limitations (Table 2).

Primary education lasts six years and is compulsory through age 11. Secondary education lasts six years and is completed in two stages: Intermediate and Preparatory. Intermediate education lasts three years for students aged 12 to 14 years. Preparatory education also lasts three years and is designed to prepare students for the labor market or university study. It is divided into two branches (scientific and literary) beginning with the second year of preparatory education, during which students pursue academic studies in the sciences or humanities. In addition, there is also a six or three-year (depending on the point of entry) vocational preparatory stream of education, which covers industrial, agricultural and commercial branches. Vocational preparatory education is designed to prepare students for work in the professions or for university study.	Intermediate education lasts three years for students aged 12 to 14 years.

An assessment of the status and trends of bioinvasion in a given area is fundamental first step in the development of a national plan for dealing with IAS issues. The Plan itself should include a strategy to build institutional support and engage all important stakeholders in the effort, particularly local communities. This national strategy will be needed to make a national commitment operational. Goals and objectives for a national plan need to shared across sectors and the strategy needs to be integrated into larger national plans for conservation and agricultural development. For invasions in natural environments, the goals will ideally include the preservation or restoration of that environment; the control of a IAS is only the first step in this process. Existing legal and institutional frameworks also need to assessed and reviewed as these are key to the sustainability of any national effort to address the problems. There is also need to have concerted bilateral, regional and sometimes global actions based on common objectives. Finally, basic biological knowledge (e.g. taxonomy) must be combined with evolving technologies and tools for management. These tools rely heavily on the existence of reliable and taxonomically comprehensive data. Broadly speaking, any national plan should comprehensively address the four categories of tools and processes for IAS management: prevention, early detection, eradication, and control. The following section provides a brief summary of these issues. Detailed descriptions and case studies for the examples mentioned below can be found in the Toolkit.

The set of risk factors contributing most to the burden of disease is changing. At the same time, large differences divide developed and less developed regions. Risk factors such as undernutrition, unimproved water and sanitation facilities, poor hygiene, and indoor smoke from solid fuels remain highly relevant in countries from developing regions. The harmful use of alcohol and tobacco, poor diet and the lack of exercise contribute substantially to the burden of noncommunicable diseases in developed regions, but their role is also increasing in developing regions.

Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education , and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world .	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.

Source and additional information: www.virtuelles-wasser.de www.waterfootprint.org Part 2 Ecological accounting We know that approximately 26 percent of the Earth's surface provides most of the materials and ecosystem services that humans demand, and that currently there are 2.1 global hectares of biocapacity available per person on the planet. However, the Earth's biosphere does not serve a solely anthropogenic purpose; the same land that supports human existence must also support the existence of other species. If society places a value on biodiversity, we must also reserve biologically productive land and resources for other, nondomesticated species. The Ecological Footprint does not measure biodiversity - it focuses only on the available supply of and demand for biocapacity by humans. But with the Footprint, we can quantify the pressure that humans put on the planet, and better address the root causes of biodiversity loss, including the pressure humans put on the habitat of plant and animal species. We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we go into overshoot by surpassing ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems for ourselves as well as for other species.

The main distinguishing features of indigenous peoples' protected areas have to do with the sociopolitical arrangements that are established between indigenous peoples and national authorities for the government of lands and resources in indigenous peoples' lands. Basically such features are that: 1. They are based upon the collective rights of the respective indigenous people, nation or community to lands, territories and resources, under national contexts; 2. They are established as protected areas in application of the right of self-determination, exercised mainly through: * Self-declaration of the protected area by the indigenous people or nation with collective territorial rights on the area; * Free, prior and informed consent of the people, nation or community with territorial rights on the area, in cases where the designation proposal is originated in government agencies, conservation organizations or other actors. 3.

The definition of the value chain ending with the value to consumers and their health has provided a very effective market development opportunity, as demonstrated by the effective use of the data in promoting peanut products in the U.S.A. The benefits to peanut consumption worldwide are important to the strategic goals of USAID's agricultural (expansion of markets), and health goals. 4.2 Market Pull versus Technology Push In Guyana and Bolivia, the production challenges were relatively simple and rapid advances in production were achieved without the parallel expansion of demand resulting in lower prices. The inelasticity of these markets demonstrates the need to balance production research with post-harvest, utilization research and market development. For the future the program needs to ensure market demand through a balanced portfolio of projects and activities aimed at creating market pull for the adoption of production enhancing technologies. The lessons of production technology treadmills learned in the U.S.A. should be applied to developing countries for poverty reduction, a Millennium Development Goal, to be realized. 4.3 Market Location Opportunities The conversion of some countries like the Philippines and Thailand from exporters to importers of peanut has been a lesson that many developing countries that produce peanuts should consider. Most countries aspire to sell peanuts on the international market; but ignore the potential value of peanuts in their Peanut CRSP External Evaluation Report 2005 - 29 - own food industries. The value adding opportunity in peanuts is a potential that can provide good economic development opportunities and in many cases there is a greater value to peanuts in the local market than internationally. The international market is very competitive and many developing countries cannot realistically be competitive against China, India, and Argentina in this area.

Overcome the financing gap. As highlighted in the rice value chain study, the ability of farmers and agribusinesses to invest is importantly determined by their access to financial services. Initiatives to expand access to finance in rural areas have as yet proven unsuccessful. Even microfinancial institutions (MFIs) devote only 5 percent of their portfolio to financing agriculture. As a result, only an estimated 14 percent of the rural population have access to formal financial services. A comprehensive agricultural finance diagnostic is called for. Successful development offinancial services will, among others, require a supportive legal and regulatory framework that enables the enforcement of legal contracts in the agricultural sector. Market-friendly government support mechanisms (such as partial credit guarantee schemes and public-private partnerships to encourage the development of agricultural insurance) will also be needed. 71 The training model followed by the Songhai agricultural training center in Porto Novo, Benin provides just one such example. It is locally owned and privately managed. Instruction favors application, with more than 75 percent of time devoted to practical subjects.

These structural and occupational transformations at the macro level reflect people's demand behavior at the micro level, that is, their relatively larger demand for non-food than for food as they get richer.15 As a result, the share of spending on food declines as incomes rise (widely known as Engel's Law), even though, in absolute terms, spending on food still increases. At the macro level this translates in a declining share of agriculture in GDP as countries develop, as well as a declining share of employment in agriculture.

In Boliva: There are two factors that contributed to the significant progress in the peanut program in Bolivia. ANAPO plays a key role in technology transfer and seed production. The first factor is ANAPO's strong linkages to technology transfer agencies such as the development foundations (FDTA) Project UFL16P - 201 - funded by a group of donors and farmers' associations. The foundations receive funding from a multidonor group called SIBTA (System for Bolivian Agricultural Technology) implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture. ANAPO has been contracted by the government through the development foundations to provide technologies and advisory services to small-scale producers. ANAPO and its partners have conducted numerous meetings and farmer training sessions in Bolivia. Men and women farmers have benefited from field days (i.e., recent Peanut Summit/Tour held in February 2005 and attended by over 100 farmers in the FDTA-Valles region), extension publications and growers' training manuals, and demonstration of simple equipment for harvesting, threshing, and grading. Scientists and technical support staff have benefited from workshops. Presently, FDTA-Valles/ANAPO is in three areas of the Valles Region, but they plan expand activities into the Chaco Region in 2005. Improved varieties introduced by ANAPO occupy about one-half of the production in the Valles Region. The second factor is the development of a Peanut Seed Production Program. Seed multiplication activities are implemented by ANAPO, a private association of farmers with seed multiplication responsibilities) have particularly good potential for technology transfer (quality seed and new cultivars). ANAPO sells certified seeds of improved varieties to farmers, facilitating the diffusion of new varieties quickly, one of the bottlenecks in many developing countries. Eight varieties are being multiplied, and counter-season production will speed up the process. In the United States. In the U.S., the Georgia Peanut Commission has shown keen interest in the collaborative project in Bolivia. Commission members have participated in field days. The Chairperson of the GPC Research Committee has shown particular interest and has been very supportive of the Peanut CRSP activities in Bolivia.

Farmers have been trying to diversify into vegetables , fruit trees , and fish cultivation but without much success because of the lack of markets .	Small farm size, a problem that is expected to increase even further because of population pressure, is a major constraint. The low and declining price of rice with the increase in rice harvest provides inadequate income for the sustenance of farming families. The low profitability in rice farming is a major disincentive to sustaining growth in productivity.

INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and / or sustainable intensification .	Given the need to stabilize the rainfed upland environment and the success of the NERICAs, WARDA implements its research strategy for this environment along the following four lines: * Increased use of NERICA seed in farmers' fields. PVS work in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire has shown the potential of NERICAs in farmers' fields. In the coming decade, WARDA will expand the number of farmers exposed to NERICAs throughout the region through PVS. * The development of new inter-and intraspecific rice cultivars. WARDA will enlarge the gene pool for uplands using advanced and more traditional breeding tools. In addition, participatory plant breeding will provide farmer input into WARDA's breeding program and speed up the identification of favorable plant material with resistance to drought and soil acidity. * Validation and dissemination of integrated natural resource management (INRM) practices. INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and/or sustainable intensification. Building on previous achievements in the development of N-fixing fallow legumes and the introduction of a modest use of fertilizer, including rock-phosphate, emphasis will be placed on integrated biophysical and socioeconomic assessment of these technologies and the formulation of adequate baskets of technologies. * Creating an enabling environment for the scaling-up of NERICAs and INRM practices. For the varietal component, a focus will be placed on community-based seed supply systems to address weak seed multiplication systems for farmers of rainfed rice. For INRM, the focus will be on strengthening the capabilities of rice development stakeholders in applying research results.

This requires ( 1 ) a favorable export growth at the national level , permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost ; and ( 2 ) at the household level , developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food .	Obviously, a country does not need to be self-sufficient in domestic food production to achieve or sustain food security. Singapore and Hong Kong (China) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region. Malaysia meets almost one-quarter of its rice needs through imports. It is a prudent policy because Malaysia maintains domestic production with subsidies; resources tied up in rice cultivation can be used more productively in alternative economic activities. What is important for food security is achieving food self-reliance. This requires (1) a favorable export growth at the national level, permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost; and (2) at the household level, developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food. Most countries in East and Rice around the world 67 Southeast Asia are fortunate in this respect. With growing economic prosperity and alleviation of poverty, they are able to fulfill these conditions. In fact, as the cost of rice production increases with growing wage rates, land prices, and scarcity of water, it makes sense to readjust resources away from labor-intensive rice cultivation, if improving economic efficiency is the primary consideration.

Schools in all Maintains countries remain closed, likely leading to a reduction in educational outcomes, reversal in literacy gains, and particularly poor outcomes for girls, in relation to re-enrolment, gender-based violence, teenage pregnancy, and early marriage. While progressive education policies have been produced in all countries, implementation remains weak. All Maintains countries have developed new approaches to be able to continue education provision during the pandemic, with Pakistan and Bangladesh focusing on TV, Sierra Leone focusing on radio, Uganda combining online and radio, and Kenya mainly online. However, many children cannot effectively access distance learning approaches, particularly in rural areas, halting their education for months, significantly affecting their life chances, and deepening inequality. 3 Gentilini, U.

Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration , so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development .	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).

The diversity in scope and content of these articles is the result of an editorial re-orientation of the journal undertaken since 2010 .	The Refugee Survey Quarterly published 44 articles in 2017 and 2018, focusing on the challenges of forced migration from multidisciplinary and policy-oriented perspectives with a broad range of academic backgrounds (such as sociology, political science, law, history, geography and economics). The diversity in scope and content of these articles is the result of an editorial re-orientation of the journal undertaken since 2010. While the journal has been published by Oxford University Press since its creation in 1982, it was previously managed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). During that time, the journal primarily published bibliographies and official documents on the protection of refugees, especially those produced by UNHCR. It then included as well special issues dedicated to a particular theme and guest edited by experts in the relevant area.

Health worker migration in response to the global shortage of health professionals demands dedicated and effective management, including building the capacity of health systems in origin countries, promotion of good practices and prevention of negative effects of health worker migration. There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.

How jobs contribute to living standards, productivity, and social cohesion varies with a country's level of development, its demography, its endowments, and its institutions. Jobs agendas are thus inherently country specific. By combining the various features of an economy, however, it is possible to build a typology of jobs challenges. It includes agrarian economies, conflict-affected countries, urbanizing countries, resource-rich countries, small island nations, countries with high youth unemployment, formalizing economies, and aging societies. Because the nature of the challenges varies, what makes a job good for development in one context may not be so relevant in another. And in some circumstances, tradeoffs emerge. The jobs that do the most to defuse tension in the short term may not do much for productivity, or those with the highest productivity impact may not lead to a broad-based improvement in living standards. Identifying good jobs for development helps visualize these tradeoffs.

"ChaPTER i. ThE hEalTh aNd wElfaRE of maNkINd 5 27. One of the most serious challenges includes the loss of state control to organized criminal groups. Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State, as well as the regional and global community. When state structures become involved with and affected by violence and systemic corruption, drug trafficking can further weaken the efficacy of Governments to the point of creating ""failed State"" conditions at the national or subregional level. Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid. 28. One of the most recent challenges to the international drug control system is that posed by the use of the Internet for drug trafficking. States must do more to enable the investigation of such illegal operations in order to ensure that such operations are identified, restricted and eliminated and that the international postal system is not used for illicit drug shipments. Internet pharmacies and other dispensing methods that physically separate the prescriber or provider from the patient pose a particular risk and require the development of more effective regulatory approaches. In such systems of supply, it is more difficult for prescribers and dispensers to evaluate the needs of patients to ensure that the prescriptions will be used for legitimate medical purposes so as to protect the health and well-being of the individual. States should be mindful of the challenges that such methods for the supply of medications may pose."

Maternity protection is a fundamental labour right enshrined in key universal human rights instruments. Maternity protection and work-family measures are essential to promoting the health and well-being of mothers and their children, achieving gender equality at work and advancing decent work for both women and men. The provision of child welfare and maternity protection has been a concern for the ILO from its very beginning. Today, 28 ILO member States have ratified Convention No.183, while 66 are party to at least one of the three Maternity Protection Conventions. Virtually allcountries have adopted important legislative provisions concerning maternity protection at work, while laws and measures to support workers with family responsibilities, including fathers, are increasingly emerging across the world. The report shows that manycountries respect key aspects of Convention No.183 even when they have not formally ratified it. For example, 98countries (53per cent) currently provide a statutory minimum of 14 weeks of maternity leave, and 42 of thosecountries meet or exceed the 18 weeks of leave proposed in Recommendation No.191. A total of 58per cent (107countries) provide for cash benefits during maternity leave through national social security schemes. Over 80per cent ofcountries set out explicit prohibitions against discrimination during pregnancy, leave, and/or an additional prescribed period. More than two-thirds of countries have statutory measures on dangerous or unhealthy work which affects pregnant or nursing women, the majority providing protective measures, such as alternatives to hazardous work.

Eastern Africa is a close second to Southern Africa in terms of competitiveness but did experience stagnation since the last edition of the report. Overall, Eastern Africa tops the broader Sub-Saharan Africa average on nine pillars, ties on three, and is the top-ranked subregion on seven. Compared to the Sub-Saharan Africa average, it maintains a minor disadvantage regarding price competitiveness, which is still its highest-scoring pillar, and a larger gap on ICT readiness. Eastern Africa's most significant advantages over Southern and Western Africa comes from better ground and port infrastructure. However, it is on natural resources where the subregion outperforms the global average. Eastern Africa lost competitiveness on seven pillars.

The 2012-2015 national employment strategy for Coted'Ivoire (Republique de Coted'Ivoire, 2012) seeks to expand employment opportunities for decent work to contribute to poverty reduction. It is based on three pillars: (a) support to private enterprises to foster growth and job creation, (b) investment in human capital and labor productivity, and (c) rationalizing governance of employment policy. A follow-up strategy note was issued in 2013 to outline how sectoral strategies, structural measures, specific programs, and business climate improvements could lead to employment creation. These strategic documents link to an initially announced presidential objective of creating 200,000 jobs per year between 2012 and 2015. A new strategy for 2016-2020 is being finalized.

A perfect illustration is the ' anticipatory interdiction ' measures implemented by Canada to manage the geopolitical ' threat ' posed by asylum claimants from Mexico .	Many IJMBS articles examined the shifting conception of borders as tools of governance and as boundaries of belonging. A perfect illustration is the 'anticipatory interdiction' measures implemented by Canada to manage the geopolitical 'threat' posed by asylum claimants from Mexico. Measures such as the United StatesCanada Safe Third Country Agreement, the Mexican visa imposition, and the safe country of origin scheme formed a virtual border to effectively filter and exclude migrants from Mexico. In a similar vein, the EU border control regime generated exclusion and precarity of migrants during the so-called 'European refugee crisis' in 2015. As an IJMBS contribution put it, when over a million people reached Europe, intense political debate on the 'crisis' has prevented public opinion from seeing how its root causes lie in the intrinsic weaknesses of the solidarity and responsibility sharing mechanisms in the EU. Indeed another article argued that the EU's political priority to counter migrant smuggling affected the provision of humanitarian assistance and access to rights for irregular immigrants and asylum seekers. Civil society actors, especially those critically monitor and politically mobilise for the rights of migrants in Europe, have faced prosecutions and criminal convictions when assisting this population. Authors pointed almost invariably to the pressing issue of ensuring transparency and accountability at the border.

This illustrates the level of participation of an economy within international production .	The decomposition of gross exports into their valueadded components The breakdown of conventional export data (gross) into their value-added components allows showing the role played by economies in global value chains. The domestic value-added content of exports is composed of the following indicators: (i) The domestic value added, embodied either in final or intermediate goods/services, directly consumed by the importing country. This represents a one-to-one country transfer of value added, with exported goods/services crossing borders only once. (ii) The domestic value added contained in intermediates exported to a first country which re-exports them to a third country as embodied in other goods/services. This indicator represents a one-to-many country transfer of value added, when exported goods/ services cross borders more than once. This illustrates the level of participation of an economy within international production. (iii) The domestic value added of exported goods/services which is eventually re-imported by the country itself.

"But transformations in living standards, productivity, and social cohesion do not necessarily happen at the same pace. Lags and gaps in rising living standards can be illustrated by the different impacts growth has on poverty reduction across countries. A 2 percent annual growth rate can reduce poverty rates by 1 percent in some countries and by 7 percent in others.46 Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia experienced periods of economic growth with very little change in poverty incidence.47 On the other hand, important advances in poverty reduction have also happened during periods of slow growth, as occurred in Brazil and Mexico during the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s.48 And in some cases, growth is not accompanied by increased social cohesion--even though poverty may fall and living standards improve for some, the expectations of others remain unfulfilled. Tunisia is a clear example in this regard: its growth rate is well above the average of the region, but it has nonetheless experienced serious social and political tensions.49 The recognition of these lags and gaps has led to more nuanced approaches to economic growth in which the growth being sought is ""pro-poor,"" ""shared,"" or ""inclusive.""50 In these versions, it is not just the rate of growth that matters but also the initial distribution of income and the possibility of redistributing resources through the growth process itself and through government transfers.51 Behind these sensible qualifiers, it is possible to point to the role of jobs. Growth is ""inclusive"" when higher earnings are driven by employment opportunities for the majority of the labor force, particularly the poor. Recent studies show that the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction depends critically on the employment intensity of different sectors.52 Employment opportunities also matter for social cohesion. It is thus jobs that bring together the three transformations."	It is thus jobs that bring together the three transformations.	World Development Report 2013: Jobs	World Bank	2012

In many sectors - - for example , transport , infrastructure , and education - - public authorities are the principal buyers .	Why does efficient public procurement matter? Public procurement is the process by which governments purchase goods and services from private firms. In many sectors--for example, transport, infrastructure, and education--public authorities are the principal buyers. Worldwide, public procurement accounts for between 10% and 25% of GDP on average, and governments cumulatively spend $10 trillion on public contracts each year.4 In OECD member economies, public procurement accounts for 12% of general government expenditures.5 At 15%, low-income economies' share of public procurement in GDP is the largest.6 Significant variation exists among economies: the ratio of government expenditure to GDP in Finland and the Netherlands is about 20%, whereas in Bahrain and Oman it is about 7%.7 Inefficient procurement regulation leads to substantial losses of public funds. Studies indicate that excess costs for a public procurement project are in the range of 25-50%.8 Research on the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Japan, and Turkey shows that improved competition reduces prices.9 Similarly, a World Bank study finds that higher accountability leads to lower costs in road construction projects, as do transparency in advertising and tendering in Italy and the Slovak Republic.10 Competition also deters bribes. A study of 34,000 firms in 88 economies shows that, in economies with more transparent procurement law, firms report paying fewer and smaller bribes to public officials.11 Losses from bribery (that is, when a firm bribes a public official to obtain a contracting advantage) represent on average between 4% and 10% of global procurement spending.12 A new World Bank study shows that up to one-fifth of the value of government contracts may be lost to corruption.13 The indirect costs of corruption lead to distorted competition. 69Contracting with the government .

"Suggestions for further work: What changes occur when biological diversity decreases? Part 2 Ecological accounting humans and wild living plants and animals will increase. The question will become: Who gets the fish - the sea lion or the human? Can declining population trends in species be reversed? If we wanted to put a full stop to human activities that lead to endangered and extinct species, we would need to make drastic changes in our living habits. It would likely require taking portions of land used by humans, and returning them to their natural state. It would also require changing our eating habits significantly. We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions, and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort. Biological diversity is not equally distributed throughout the world. Many biodiversity hotspots lie in Central America and western Amazonia, in the Cape area of South Africa, and in the mountains and plains of East Africa. Other regions rich in biodiversity include the coastal regions and islands of the Mediterranean, Southwest China, and the bordering areas from Burma to Vietnam. Large parts of Madagascar also belong to this list, as do numerous islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Following Maxwell ( 1996 ) we classified coping strategies as those that do not enable accumulation of assets , preclude investment , or inhibit transformation of existing structural constraints to rice cropping ( Maxwell 1996 ) .	Following climate hazard shocks to rice cropping, farmers undertook an array of coping strategies. Following Maxwell (1996) we classified coping strategies as those that do not enable accumulation of assets, preclude investment, or inhibit transformation of existing structural constraints to rice cropping (Maxwell 1996). Coping strategies are used when normal livelihood function supported by rice farming is not possible. The following coping strategies are used during cropping seasons that are not impacted by climate hazards: accessing the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)[7], selling household assets, migration, daily wage labor, and loan taking. These coping strategies are part of a low-productivity/low-income rice-based livelihood system. Following climate hazards two additional coping strategies were employed: (i) reducing levels of household food consumption and (ii) securing government relief (Table 5).

Restrictions on the flow of data have a significant effect on the conditions for the cross-border supply of numerous services and for support to the functionality embedded in trade in intelligent goods ( i.e ., smart devices ) .	The free flow of data has been critical to the continued growth of digital trade. The United States monitors and works to eliminate data localization requirements, which are unfortunately a growing global trend. The GDPR restricts the transfer of the personal data of EU citizens outside of the EU, except to specific countries that the EU has determined provide adequate data protection under EU law or when other specific requirements are met, such as the use of standard contract clauses or binding corporate rules. The United States remains concerned, that the implementation and administration of the GDPR create disproportionate barriers to trade, not only for the United States, but for all countries outside of the EU. Although the United States has received a determination of partial adequacy from the EU (for information on the European Union-United States Privacy Shield Framework, see below), there are many other countries, including India, Japan, and Korea, that have expressed interest in obtaining an adequacy determination to facilitate the exchange of data with the EU. Restrictions on the flow of data have a significant effect on the conditions for the cross-border supply of numerous services and for support to the functionality embedded in trade in intelligent goods (i.e., smart devices). The EU has so far found only a handful of countries to provide adequate data protection under EU law, which means that suppliers in the large majority of EU trading partners must rely on other arrangements or criteria to transfer data with suppliers in the EU. Moreover, legal challenges in the EU continue to create uncertainty around the transfer of data for U.S. and other foreign companies. As of the end of 2018, the validity of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework was the subject of a case before the EU's General Court, and the use of standard contract clauses was under judicial review in Ireland with the issue of its referral to the CJEU on appeal to the Irish Supreme Court.

Private tutoring in English is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. During recent decades, it has grown to become a vast enterprise. A huge number of children receive this private supplementary tutoring in English in Bangladesh. Children receiving such tutoring are then able to perform better in school which is not a new phenomenon in Bangladesh but also other parts of the world. English is an international language and it is gaining more space in the national education curriculum in Bangladesh, at first, English was only an elective subject but now it is a compulsory subject. So, a substantial number of families hire private tutors of English for their sons and daughters to improve their English. Children's education is the top priority for most of the parents. As some children struggle to keep up with their schoolwork, home tuition in particular plays a very important part in helping the weaker students cope with today's competitive learning environment. In fact, home tuition has long been an integral part of our education scene. So in many ways private tutoring is necessary especially for Bangla medium young learners or primary school students in Bangladesh. While private tutoring have positive consequences, such as improving students learning, employment for tutors, help to get good grades in exam, it also have negative consequences, like pressure on young learners, establish social inequalities, de-motivated to learn in the mainstream system and manipulation of students by tutors. Therefore, this study aims to find out the reasons and necessity of private tutoring in English for primary school students in Bangladesh.

Workshops: In Senegal, two workshops were held in 2002 participated by 40 NGO members (mainly women) on health education methodologies, gender, and aflatoxin contamination. In Uganda, the following workshops were held: (1) one workshop in April 2004 at Makerere University on health education methodologies and gender issues for 15 participants including faculty, VT54 - 103 - students, and health workers. The Ministry of Health appreciated the training on aflatoxin since the staff was not aware of the health risks caused by aflatoxin contamination; (2) two workshops were held in November 2004, the first in Iganga/Mayuge and the second in Mubende, to finalize the Health Education Program. Each had four health workers and a supervisor as participants. The workshops were facilitated by Dr. Colette Harris and Dr. Archileo Kaaya with support from two Makerere students (women). Total participants: Iganga/Mayuge workshop four women plus four men plus the two facilitators (1 man, 1 woman), and Mubende: five women and a man with two facilitators. Publications: Seven publications, reports, thesis reports were produced by U.S. and Host Country Project Teams: 1. A paper in international newsletter on aflatoxin contamination in groundnuts in Uganda. 2. A manuscript submitted on Aflatoxin levels on farms and in markets in Uganda, submitted to Peanut Science on aflatoxin and women farmers, entitled: 'Aflatoxins in Peanuts, the health risk versus the economic costs: Some reflections on local viewpoints from the Senegalese Peanut Basin' in Proceedings of Women's Worlds 2002 Conference.

This can create new jobs on the farm, but increasingly also off farm, in the expanding agricultural value chains and agribusiness. It is countries that complement a successful structural transformation (declining share of agriculture in the economy as they develop) with a successful agricultural transformation (declining share of staples in agricultural value added) which experience the fastest decline in (rural) poverty.

Ensuring sustainable tourism The preservation of natural and cultural resources is another challenge the industry must overcome. Results show that the number of UNESCO cultural and natural sites, as well as intangible cultural heritage listings, keeps growing, indicating greater commitment to preserving some of the key attractions driving people to visit destinations. Encouragingly, Environmental Sustainability (pillar 9) scores have been boosted by the increase in environmental treaty ratifications and improved perceptions that T&T is being developed in a sustainable manner, all of which bodes well for natural resources and nature-based tourism. While this is promising, the enforcement of treaties and protected lands might not be enough to preserve natural resources, given that air pollution, deforestation and species endangerment have continued to rise over the last two years. Since the last edition of the report, the global average score for perceptions of the stringency and enforcement of environmental regulations improved by just 0.4%. Sadly, these perceptions declined the most in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that already struggles to better utilize its natural assets. As a result, it is vital that T&T stakeholders recognize their role in environmental protection, or they run the risk of losing out on future nature tourism.

Contract farming is common in tobacco-producing low-and middle-income countries , whose governments welcome it as both as a way to attract foreign investment and export earnings , and to incorporate smallholder farmers in the national economy without drawing on government revenues and services .	Contract farming is common in tobacco-producing low-and middle-income countries, whose governments welcome it as both as a way to attract foreign investment and export earnings, and to incorporate smallholder farmers in the national economy without drawing on government revenues and services. It typically involves legal agreements between smallholder farmers and large transnational tobacco companies, resulting in the often high cost of tobacco farming being borne by the farmers themselves (74). Tobacco prices and grades are specified in the contracts and are usually determined by the buyer - leaving farmers little room for negotiation. Research from many tobacco-producing countries points to the process of grading the quality of tobacco leaves as a mechanism through which transnational tobacco companies forcibly reduce their costs and which accounts, in large part, for the high profitability of the tobacco industry. Farmers in Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Vietnam are believed to be intentionally cheated by systematic under-grading - and therefore underpricing - of their tobacco leaf (68, 73, 75, 78, 80).

A field-level mini-survey was carried out in May 2003 in three villages to collect farming and post-harvest practices related to peanuts and aflatoxin. The survey was carried out by two Virginia Tech Teams and the Makerere University coordinator. Then a farm-level survey was carried out in 2003-2004 in four villages in the peanut growing areas of Uganda (in Mubende, Iganga, and Mayuge Districts) to assess the aflatoxin level in peanuts which was initially determined to be high by the IPM CRSP team.

Local customs , such as religious practices or the use of leisure time , often determine whether a product is marketable .	Buyer preferences in a foreign market may also lead you to modify your product. Local customs, such as religious practices or the use of leisure time, often determine whether a product is marketable. The sensory impression a product makes, such as taste, smell, or a visual effect, may also be a critical factor. For example, Japanese consumers tend to prefer certain kinds of packaging, leading many U.S. companies to redesign cartons and packages that are destined for the Japanese market. Body size may also be an issue. If a product is made for U.S. body types, it may not work for people of smaller statures.

Throughout centuries , POF was provided by financial intermediaries engaged in a relationship model with customers , where the purchase order would act as sufficient collateral to finance the project ( Davidson , 1986 ) .	114. The development of credit risk assessment technologies has favoured the consolidation and broader diffusion of POF. POF, factoring and trade finance, as we know them today, date back to the Middle Ages, to the business practices of English factors in the 14th through the 17th centuries, as England grew from an agrarian economy to a modern commercial economy. These practices evolved out of experiences of banks in 13th century Italy, which were grounded in factoring practices of the Roman Empire5. Throughout centuries, POF was provided by financial intermediaries engaged in a relationship model with customers, where the purchase order would act as sufficient collateral to finance the project (Davidson, 1986). In recent decades, particularly since the 1990s, the advances in technological platforms to assess risk facilitated the development of POF as an instrument to fund SMEs (van der Vliet et al., 2013), without restricting this to the relationship lending business model.

Being in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move .	The IJMBS contributed to the understanding of how the logics of borders are confronted by migrant realities and everyday experiences. Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants' journeys. Being in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move. Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities. In particular, there has been a mounting pressure on the first countries of asylum to double efforts to locally integrate refugees they are hosting. However these countries struggle to meet the social and economic needs of refugees who often face discrimination. As described in an article, the desire to move on with their lives and escape the interminable temporariness in Turkey propelled some Syrian refugees to engage in secondary movements throughout the EU, despite the risks of the journey. For similar reasons, the vast majority of one million refugees who landed in Greece and Italy in 2015-2016, then engaged in secondary movements to escape the temporary status and the exploitative economies of transit. Another contribution shed light on the situation of asylum seekers confined in Indonesia and who hope to be resettled in Australia. It demonstrated that limbo in transit encouraged migrants to agree to assisted voluntary return, in many cases, to places where they may face persecution.

Impunity for grave violations of the past remained a live concern. Victims of crimes committed in recent and ongoing conflicts generally faced entrenched impunity at a national level. In Iraq, the authorities announced investigations in response to some allegations of serious violations committed by Iraqi forces and pro-government militias - such as torture, extrajudicial execution and enforced disappearance. However, they consistently failed to make any findings public. In Libya, the judicial system was hamstrung by its own dysfunctionality, with magistrates often failing to pursue accountability for abuses because of fears of reprisal. In Syria, the judicial system lacked independence, and failed to investigate and prosecute crimes by state forces. In Yemen, the National Commission to Investigate Alleged Violations of Human Rights, established by the government, failed to conduct investigations consistent with international standards into alleged violations committed by all parties to the conflict in Yemen.

International Migration Review (IMR) focuses on the interdisciplinary study of international migration. It publishes 30 to 40 articles a year, along with shorter research notes and book reviews. Led by an interdisciplinary editorial team from economics, sociology, and geography and guided by an international and interdisciplinary editorial board, IMR seeks to publish articles that both are grounded in rich empirics and push the boundaries of how, where, and from what perspective we examine the complexities of international migration. The interplay between the two 'I' words associated with IMR - interdisciplinary and international - guides what we, as editors, seek in publications.

In Ghana, the partnership between KNUST, the Cocoa Processing Company, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and Ghana University has been a positive impact. The host country Principal Investigator and the Ph.D. graduate student have benefited in career growth. The collaborations among scientists involved in Peanut CRSP projects TAM50, OKS55, and AUB30, have been a positive result for the program. It is noted that the OKS55 and host country Principal Investigators collaborate with the AUB30 Principal Investigator. Work in Peanut CRSP project UGA01 (R. Phillips, University of Georgia; S. Sefa-Dedeh, University of Ghana) is developing technologies for reducing aflatoxin contamination in peanut meal by extrusion in the presence of HSCAS clay. This is part of multi-faceted studies using a number of methods and processes to eliminate substances in peanut foods affecting health. The Project OKS55 - 306 - work on HSCAS clay in UGA01 complements OKS55, but the latter has the advantage of working with local peanut foods in Ghana rather than trying to introduce new food technologies.

The Goal 3 targets focusing on health status and services can only be realized for persons with disabilities if their implementation is in line with article 25 of the CRPD. In order to achieve the highest attainable standard of health for persons with disabilities, the following actions should be taken into account: 1) Strengthen national legislation and policies on health care in line with the CRPD. The process of assessing existing laws and policies should involve all stakeholders, including organizations of persons with disabilities, and should be based on information about health inequalities as well as evidence-based assessments of the gaps in health-care service delivery and of the policy and legal barriers to accessing health-care services.

"Some forms of environmental change, including sea-level rise and glacier melt, may require large-scale government action. However, interventions can leave people no better off, or even worse, than before. As described in section 3.3 of this report, for instance, the government of Vietnam is currently relocating some people living in areas threatened by riverbank erosion, flooding and storm surges. Though the intention is commendable, resettlement can carry high costs including cultural degradation, lost livelihoods, reduced access to social services, and the loss of employment networks.

A growing proportion of women are using contraceptives and the demand for family planning is increasingly being satisfied. Worldwide, the number of maternal deaths declined by 45 per cent between 1990 and 2013. Still, in sub-Saharan Africa, only half of pregnant women receive adequate care during childbirth. In 2014, 83 per cent of pregnant women in developing regions had at least one antenatal care visit, an improvement of 19 percentage points since 1990.

Despite the still considerable labor surplus in rural areas, real wages in agriculture have increased from the monetary equivalent of less than 2.5 kilograms of rice a day in 1983 to more than 6.0 kilograms today.

Article 18 (Protection of the environment and the health of persons): Before 2016, not much attention had been devoted to this Article. However, during a meeting of the WHO FCTC's governing bodies in 2016 (the Seventh Annual Conference of the Parties, or COP7), the WHO FCTC Secretariat invited WHO and other relevant international organizations to prepare a report for COP8 on the environmental impact of the tobacco life cycle. The intention is for this overview to be used to outline policy options and practical orientations to help Member States mitigate tobacco's environmental impact. At the same time, COP7 also requested the WHO FCTC Secretariat to help Parties advance Sustainable Development Goal initiatives aimed at raising awareness about occupational and environmental risks related to tobacco growing. Organizations and treaties with the capacity to support this are listed at the end of this chapter. 34/ To b a c c o a n d i t s e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t : a n o v e r v i e w Article 19 (Liability): This Article can be used to hold the tobacco industry liable for environmental damage and chemical exposures to farmers (including those who suffer from Green Tobacco Disease); manufacturing and transport employees; consumers; and those affected by post-consumer waste. The persistence of thirdhand smoke pollutants is a good example of the kind of liability issues that the industry should face, given the longevity of their impacts. Because third-hand smoke may persist for months or years, owners, buyers, and users of third-hand-smoke polluted homes, apartments, hotel rooms and cars face consequences long after the cigarettes have been smoked. In the USA, it is now common for hotel and car rental companies to charge customers a penalty after someone has violated a non-smoking policy. Similarly, third-hand-smoke polluted homes and cars stay longer on the market, and tend to sell for a lower price. Liability for damage and harm done by third-hand smoke should be clarified, as this could play an important role in overall tobacco control efforts.

Several institutions provide spatially explicit data using advanced technologies .	Overall, Mexico and Quintana Roo have a suite of geospatial data underpinning technical support for FLR. Several institutions provide spatially explicit data using advanced technologies. The National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) manages the LULC map of Mexico at 1:250,000 scale. The LULC map depicts different categories of vegetation cover and anthropogenic land use, including 12 categories of agricultural use and livestock grazing. This geospatial database is consolidated using remote sensing and field calibration across the whole country for specific time periods: Series I (1979-1991); Series II (1993-1999); Series III (2002-2005); Series IV (2006-2010); Series V (2011-2013); and Series VI (2014-2017). In addition to the LULC maps produced by INEGI, INECC hosts the Environmental Maps of Mexico, a platform that provides national maps monitoring LULC change dynamics over the period 1976-2008, based on comparison of the LULC maps in Series II-IV. The aim is that, in the near future, the Environmental Maps of Mexico will focus on providing updated information regarding LULC change, including both deforestation and restoration/afforestation, based on the most recent versions of field-calibrated LULC maps (Series V onwards) at 1:250,000 resolution. Once implemented, this system should be able to keep track of indicators of restoration from space. However, in order to verify that the restoration is actually bringing ecological benefits back to those land areas and their surroundings, it will need to be complemented by field data.

However , biotechnology research may be conducted in laboratory greenhouses , and in 2016 , the National Center for Biotechnology ( under the Ministry of Education and Science ) developed a transgenic breed of cotton with higher pesticide resistance .	Kazakhstan continues to enforce CU regulations covering agricultural biotechnology products, which require the labeling of both imported and domestically produced agricultural biotechnology products. As Kazakhstan continues to integrate into the EAEU, it is expected that the policies and views of other EAEU countries will play a greater role in shaping the regulation of agricultural biotechnology in Kazakhstan.

However, biotechnology research may be conducted in laboratory greenhouses, and in 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology (under the Ministry of Education and Science) developed a transgenic breed of cotton with higher pesticide resistance. In 2012 and 2013, Kazakhstan and Russia both banned the importation of GE-corn NK603 as a result of a published study by a French scientist questioning the safety of that type of GE-corn. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refuted the scientific validity of the study and noted it should not be considered as valid for risk assessment. Russia removed the ban without any public acknowledgement, and Kazakhstan has not made public the status of its ban. Therefore, it is effectively still in place, and no one has attempted to import this line of corn.

In clusters, similar firms that locate next to each other tend to benefit from a broader pool of qualified workers and common support services. Firms also connect with foreign businesses through trade and investment, and, in integrating with global value chains, they can acquire more advanced knowledge, technology, and management know-how. In all these ways, specific jobs can contribute to productivity gains of others and elsewhere in the economy.

Banks should gather sufficient information on any person / customer of this category intending to establish a relationship and check all the information available on the person in the public domain .	Q14. In what circumstances is additional due diligence required for Politically Exposed Persons ('PEPs')? A14. Banks should gather sufficient information on any person/customer of this category intending to establish a relationship and check all the information available on the person in the public domain. Banks should verify the identity of the person and seek information about their source of funds before accepting the PEP as a customer. The decision to open an account for a PEP should be taken at a senior level which should be clearly identified in the Customer Acceptance policy. Banks should also subject such accounts to enhanced monitoring on an ongoing basis. The above may also be applied to the accounts of the family members or close relatives of PEPs. In the case of an existing customer or the beneficial owner of an existing account subsequently becoming a PEP, banks should obtain senior management approval to continue the business relationship and subject the account to the customer due diligence measures as applicable to the customers of a PEP category including enhanced monitoring on an ongoing basis. These instructions are also applicable to accounts where a PEP is the ultimate beneficial owner. Further, banks should have appropriate ongoing risk management procedures for identifying and applying enhanced customer due diligence to PEPs, customers who are close relatives of PEPs, and accounts of which a PEP is the ultimate beneficial owner.

Protection issues , including gender-based , sexual and physical violence , are areas of concern , as are family separations and psychosocial distress and trauma , and harmful practices such as child marriages .	The Government and humanitarian partners project that at least 8 million people will require humanitarian assistance in 2020. Conflict, displacement and disease outbreaks, as well as rainfall shortages in some parts of the country and flooding in others, will remain key drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. In 2020, it is estimated that 3.7 million people will continue to be chronically food insecure. In the absence of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and practices, cholera outbreaks are expected to continue to occur. Seasonal flooding is also an annual occurrence, as are invasions by desert locusts and other pests, which are likely to contribute to significant losses in crop harvest and pastures, including in Afar, Amhara, Oromia and Somali regions. The overall condition of IDPs and returnees will continue to be dire. Hygiene and sanitation, as well as shelter conditions, are often inadequate. Protection issues, including gender-based, sexual and physical violence, are areas of concern, as are family separations and psychosocial distress and trauma, and harmful practices such as child marriages. Also of concern is that some people with specific needs are unable to access life-saving services, and that some have no legal redress for lost property and livelihood because they lack documentation. For these reasons, people in need will continue to require sustained multisector humanitarian assistance, recovery and durable solutions well into 2020. An increase in conflicts and displacements remains a possibility in 2020, given the uncertainty around the national elections in May.

Courses were carried out at three levels: (1) international/regional that focused on Southeast Asian scientists, (2) national level for Thai researchers and extension workers, and (3) village level for owners of micro-and small-scale enterprises involving whole villages. Planning and implementation of training courses involved many institutions besides Kasetsart University: other Thai universities such as Khon Kaen University, the Agricultural Extension Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Farmers' and Women's Associations, development projects such as the Thai Princess' Project, other donors such as FAO and USAID, and other stakeholders. The main topics for training were new/improved processing techniques, especially to remove aflatoxin contamination in whole kernels, and use of Elisa technique, a quick method to detect aflatoxin contamination. Participants also learned how to process improved traditional and new peanut products. During the international and national training, Kasetsart University trainors used on-site training methods by bringing the trainees to the villages to experience actually processing of peanut products with village-level micro-and small-scale processors. Overall evaluation of training courses has not been completed, although an impact study of six training workshops held in 2002 is ongoing to determine the impact of training on former participants. During the evaluation, survey data were being encoded, hence, a report was not available.	The main topics for training were new/improved processing techniques, especially to remove aflatoxin contamination in whole kernels, and use of Elisa technique, a quick method to detect aflatoxin contamination.

A complete curriculum has been developed , containing a facilitators ' manual and a technical manual dealing with all management interventions from land preparation to harvest and postharvest issues .	Inland valleys have very complex, dynamic, and diverse human, social, natural, and physical dimensions and interconnections. This complexity needs to be understood to determine options for improved and integrated natural resource management. Given the diversity of inland-valley ecosystems, a bottom-up social learning process will be critical. Only then can sustainable and lasting impact on food security in the region be achieved. A participatory learning and action research approach among inlandvalley development stakeholders (farmers, change agents, extension, research) at the grassroots level is required. This will help build bridges between indigenous knowledge and scientific expertise, and stimulate the formation of networks between farmers and other inlandvalley development stakeholders. It will also be instrumental to the development of an INRM framework and curriculum for farmer learning for inland valleys in West Africa. WARDA is using integrated rice management as an entry point to INRM for inland valleys. A complete curriculum has been developed, containing a facilitators' manual and a technical manual dealing with all management interventions from land preparation to harvest and postharvest issues.

There is a need to improve English proficiency of Bulgarian researchers to facilitate their acceptance in U.S. for training. During the review in Bulgaria, there was an awareness and concern about the potential change of status of Bulgaria with respect to Peanut CRSP and the effect on future funding. Part of the time spent at ICFT was devoted to discussing opportunities for EU funding in FP6 and mechanisms for support through Twinning and Maria Curie Fellowships that might be used. The assessment is that the EU is very unlikely to directly continue funding along the same lines as Peanut CRSP but that there might be opportunities to continue to develop the 'Establishment of a Food Research and Development Center for Southern and Eastern Europe'. Peanut CRSP has established excellent sensory panel facilities at ICFT that will have applications in areas other than peanut sensory work and funding to utilize these facilities and continue to develop expertise might be forthcoming. Once a baseline funding albeit in other areas is established this should provide the flexibility needed to continue with some of the peanut CRSP initiatives.

As a member of the Central American Common Market, Honduras applies a harmonized external tariff on most items at a maximum of 15 percent, with some exceptions. Under the CAFTA-DR, 100 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods enter Honduras duty free. Nearly all textile and apparel goods that meet the Agreement's rules of origin also enter Honduras duty free and quota free, creating opportunities for U.S. fiber, yarn, fabric, and apparel manufacturers. In addition, most U.S. agricultural exports enter Honduras duty free. Honduras will eliminate its remaining tariffs on nearly all U.S. agricultural products by 2025. Honduras will eliminate tariffs on yellow corn and pork by 2020; on rice and chicken leg quarters by 2023; and on dairy products by 2025. For certain products, tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) permit some duty-free access for specified quantities during the tariff phase-out period, with the duty-free quantities expanding during that period. Honduras will liberalize trade in white corn through continual expansion of a TRQ, rather than by the reduction of the out-of-quota tariff. The Honduran government is required under the CAFTA-DR to make TRQs available on January 1 of each year. Honduras monitors its TRQs through an import licensing system, which the United States is carefully tracking to ensure Honduran issuance of these permits occurs in a timely manner. 228 | foreign trade barriers .

These include watershed management and promote increased agricultural productivity through strategies such as climate-smart agriculture, water conservation, soil fertility management, erosion control and soil management. Another key policy that supports agroforestry is the national horticulture policy, which promotes fruit tree planting by establishing incentive mechanisms, strengthening value chains and developing markets for horticulture products; it has a significant effect on the promotion of FLR in Rwanda. In particular, the horticulture policy promotes the establishment of village nurseries for fruit trees. Other policies that support agroforestry include the Agroforestry Strategy and Action Plan 2018-2027, which is being developed to promote leadership and synergies in agroforestry as well as to engage coordinated action and implementation in Rwanda's National Forestry Policy and National Agriculture Policy.

The advantages of these tools over traditional mechanisms (i.e. using trained taxonomists) for phytosanitary services are inter alia: * quick development of the identification and information tools * quick, inexpensive training in the use of the tools * quick, accurate identification of intercepted organisms * more thorough inspection due to easy access to information on signs and symptoms, and the identification of organisms * expansion of the organism groups an inspector can consider * quick access to applicable information for the treatment of intercepted organisms and/or infested goods * quick identification and communication with taxonomists, and other experts * dispatch of quality information, e.g. electronic images and test results, to specialists * enabling taxonomists to undertake more taxonomic revisions and to develop new, better identification and information products. After initial investment in the development of these tools, it is reasonable to suggest that: * routine identifications will take place at the ports of importation or exportation * services at small regional border posts will be dramatically improved * support services from taxonomic organizations will be improved.

Better Work is modeled on the Better Factories Cambodia program, which was introduced in conjunction with the bilateral trade agreement between Cambodia and the United States. Results of evaluations of Better Factories Cambodia, covering more than 90 percent of participating factories, found that compliance on occupational safety and health improved 20 percent. Correct payment of wages, overtime, and benefits increased 37 percent. Initially, incentives to improve working conditions were driven by the quota increases called for under the trade agreement; however, with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), quota increases were no longer possible. Nevertheless, the Cambodian garment industry has continued to invest in monitoring, having identified labor compliance as an important part of its claim to a niche in the global garment industry. This niche exists despite the expiration of the MFA largely because of the role that reputation plays in the supply chain. 308 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 proposals in the Doha agenda and in regional trade discussions offer prospects for significant liberalization (figure 9.7). 102 However, the productivity gains from services liberalization would be substantial. Electricity, finance, telecommunications, and trade have a direct impact on production and transaction costs, making downstream sectors more competitive. By boosting job creation and raising labor earnings, these productivity gains should also lead to improved living standards. Social impacts can be more mixed. They are clearly positive when cell phones connect people (especially the poor) to markets for their products, to employment opportunities, or to government services. They can be negative when the disappearance of retail trade leads to the decline of traditional urban areas and affects the livelihoods of older shopkeepers who may not find alternative employment easily.

The political declaration at the UN high-level meeting included the first global financing target for TB research and development to be agreed by all UN Member States.

Despite these problems, the future of social protection will inevitably include creative ways of applying new technology. extent by differentiating the level of benefits between the two systems and financing the parallel system on at least a partially contributory basis.83 Another approach is to partially subsidize participation by farmers and the self-employed in general social insurance programs. In Vietnam, those classified as poor get their health insurance cards fully paid by the budget, while the ""near poor"" get a 50 percent subsidy.84 This second approach may look similar to the previous one, as funding relies on general tax revenue too. But it has the advantage of not discouraging formalization. From a social cohesion point of view it also allows building universal systems, rather than two-tier systems."

Millions of men , women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year .	Millions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year. Disruptions such as cyclones, floods and wildfires destroy homes and assets, and contribute to the displacement of people. Slow-onset processes - such as sea-level rise changes in rainfall patterns and droughts - contribute to pressures on livelihoods, and access to food and water, that can contribute to decisions to move away in search of more tenable living conditions. Advances in meteorological and other sciences which inform about the dynamics and pace of climate change indicate that disruptions ranging from extreme weather events to large scale changes in ecosystems are occurring at a pace and intensity unlike any other known period of time on Earth.2 Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increasingly affect migration and other forms of people moving to manage these changing risks.3 This chapter provides an up-to-date overview of environmental change and the spectrum of human mobility. It first explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration, ranging from the view that human mobility including migration is a security issue, that it is an issue of protection, and that it is a matter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change. The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world. It then summarizes recent developments in the international policy sphere on the topic. The conclusion draws out the implications for research, policy and practice.

The hybrids have a yield advantage of 15% to 20% over the currently inbred high-yielding varieties. Rice hybrids were developed in China. The increase in rice yields in China during 1975-90 was due largely to the diffusion of hybrid varieties to 50% of the rice area. The Chinese hybrids are not suitable for the tropical climates in Southeast and South Asia. IRRI scientists have developed suitable hybrid lines for the tropics and these are now being used by scientists in India and Vietnam to develop varieties for release to farmers. However, with the high cost of seeds and low prices (because of inferior grain quality), hybrid rice varieties do not have an advantage over the high-yielding varieties with regard to profitability. This will constrain the adoption of hybrid rice by farmers unless breeders are successful in developing better quality hybrids with higher heterosis. Another constraint may be that, when using hybrids, farmers need to change seeds every season, which is an unconventional practice.	Rice around the world 65 for the tropics.

These laws were part of a national security legal architecture introduced in 2014 - which also included the Anti-espionage Law , Criminal Law Amendment ( 9 ) , National Security Law , Anti-terrorism Law and Cyber Security Law - and presented serious threats to the protection of human rights .	"Sweeping national security-related laws and regulations continued to be drafted and enacted, giving greater powers to the authorities to silence dissent, censor information and harass and prosecute human rights defenders. On 1 January the foreign NGO management law, whose provisions impeded independent operations of registered NGOs, came into effect. Foreign NGOs that had not yet registered and continued to operate in China could face a freeze on bank accounts, sealing of venues, confiscation of assets, suspension of activities and detention of staff. 126 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 In June, the National Intelligence Law was adopted and entered into force. These laws were part of a national security legal architecture introduced in 2014 - which also included the Anti-espionage Law, Criminal Law Amendment (9), National Security Law, Anti-terrorism Law and Cyber Security Law - and presented serious threats to the protection of human rights. The National Intelligence Law used similarly vague and overbroad concepts of national security, and granted effectively unchecked powers to national intelligence institutions with unclear roles and responsibilities. All lacked safeguards to protect against arbitrary detention and to protect the right to privacy, freedom of expression and other human rights.1 The draft Supervision Law, which opened for consultation in November, would, if enacted as is, legalize a new form of arbitrary detention, named liuzhi, and create an extrajudicial system with far-reaching powers with significant potential to infringe human rights.2 The authorities continued to use ""residential surveillance in a designated location"", a form of secret incommunicado detention that allowed the police to hold individuals for up to six months outside the formal detention system, without access to legal counsel of their choice, their families or others, and placed suspects at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. This form of detention was used to curb the activities of human rights defenders, including lawyers, activists and religious practitioners."	These laws were part of a national security legal architecture introduced in 2014 - which also included the Anti-espionage Law, Criminal Law Amendment (9), National Security Law, Anti-terrorism Law and Cyber Security Law - and presented serious threats to the protection of human rights.

Malaysia's food product standard, MS1500:2009, which establishes guidelines on halal food production, preparation, handling, and storage, imposes requirements beyond those reflected in internationallyrecognized halal standards contained in the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex). Specifically, the Malaysian standards require slaughter plants to maintain dedicated halal production facilities and ensure segregated storage and transportation facilities for halal and non-halal products. In contrast, the Codex allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed. All domestic and foreign meat (except pork) must be certified as halal by the Malaysian authorities or a Foreign Halal Certification Body (FHCB). The halal practices of foreign producers must be inspected and approved for conformity with Malaysian standards before being permitted to export to Malaysia. To date, Malaysia's Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), in conjunction with Malaysia's Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM), has approved only one U.S. beef plant and one U.S. poultry (turkey) plant for export of halal products to Malaysia.	In contrast, the Codex allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed.

Resource-rich countries face similar pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and the commodity booms of the last few years have only made these pressures stronger. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance are needed to jump-start development, cope with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact on export diversification.77 An enabling business environment. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase, is the top constraint in low-and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets have the potential to allocate resources toward more productive uses, thwart the channeling of resources to those with political connections or economic power, and expand financial in- those jobs. If this is the case, policies should remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily removed, offsetting them may be an option, but the costs and benefits of doing so need to be carefully assessed.

Despite these efforts and bilateral commitments, U.S. firms and citizens continue to report corruption in the government, including in the judiciary, to be a significant concern and a constraint to successful investment in Honduras. These reports suggest that corruption is pervasive in government procurement, the issuance of government permits, and the regulatory system in general. Telecommunications, health, and energy sectors also appear to be particularly problematic, as do real estate transactions (particularly land title transfers).

The following field case study was carried out under the auspices of the ProVention Consortium. The field case study was undertaken in the southern provinces of Mozambique to collect information about postemergency recovery interventions and their impacts on households affected by the 2000 floods. Field work was carried out in the provinces of Maputo, Gaza, and Inhambane approximately two years after the disaster. The results of the fieldwork are described and aspects of best practice identified. The last section of the document presents lessons learned as identified by the people interviewed and the team of researchers during the field work exercise. The study is part of a larger review that intends to examine how patterns of recovery assistance have evolved following major natural disasters, and the strengths and weaknesses of such patterns in terms of their furtherance of disaster reduction and sustainable development in these countries. The lessons learned and good practice identified through this analysis are intended to be of use to the donor community and governments in developing more effective policies and procedures and in crafting future disaster assistance programs. The exercise will focus on how replicable good practice is achieved and how constraints to overcoming good practice are overcome. The lesson learning exercise is comparative; it is intended to draw out similarities and differences between the different experiences of recovery.

Singapore and Hong Kong ( China ) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region .	Obviously, a country does not need to be self-sufficient in domestic food production to achieve or sustain food security. Singapore and Hong Kong (China) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region. Malaysia meets almost one-quarter of its rice needs through imports. It is a prudent policy because Malaysia maintains domestic production with subsidies; resources tied up in rice cultivation can be used more productively in alternative economic activities. What is important for food security is achieving food self-reliance. This requires (1) a favorable export growth at the national level, permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost; and (2) at the household level, developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food. Most countries in East and Rice around the world 67 Southeast Asia are fortunate in this respect. With growing economic prosperity and alleviation of poverty, they are able to fulfill these conditions. In fact, as the cost of rice production increases with growing wage rates, land prices, and scarcity of water, it makes sense to readjust resources away from labor-intensive rice cultivation, if improving economic efficiency is the primary consideration.

One student completed a Ph.D. degree and five completed M.S. degrees. Institutions and scientists in the U.S.A. and host countries have benefited from training in new procedures and techniques. Expertise in data collection, software development and modeling has been gained in UFL13 and NCS19. UGA28 has contributed to improved transformation techniques resulting in greater recovery of transgenic plants with better fertility. TAM17 has refined the introgression of useful traits from wild species, the identification of markers for useful traits, fatty acid and oil quality assay capabilities, and molecular biological techniques. FAM51 has characterized biochemical responses to drought and has identified drought-resistant genotypes. Screening techniques have been improved, and markers for identification of drought tolerant genotypes have been identified. Proteins are being evaluated for their anti-microbial activity against Aspergillus flavus. Items of equipment have been made available to some host countries and include vehicles, computers, digital cameras, and Global Positioning Systems (UFL13 and NCS19).

Expenses related to cultural activities Households struggling to access food via rice farming strategies remained saddled with other income stresses .	Expenses related to cultural activities Households struggling to access food via rice farming strategies remained saddled with other income stresses. These could be large significant events such as weddings or repeat small-scale household expenditures, e.g., for medicine. Weddings presented households with substantial costs, but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor. As a result, scarce financial resources were not invested into enhancing returns from rice farming. For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13). The costs of weddings often exceeded rice farmers' financial capabilities, resulting in loan taking or sales of land. The knock-on effect is reduced investment in rice cropping, increased loan taking, or asset sales serving to reduce rice cropping households' long-term climate resilience.

Yet , it is argued that it is exactly the extent to which countries manage to transform their agriculture away from staple crops , as they get richer and their staple crop productivity reaches sufficiently high levels , which determines whether they can generate productive employment for the poor and sustain the pace of rural poverty reduction .	There are also caveats to the somewhat more pessimistic perspective from the demand side. While Engel's Law holds globally, its strength at the national level depends on the tradability and comparative advantage of the countries' agricultural commodities. Furthermore, part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture, following the lower (relative) demand for staples as incomes rise, will be offset by the increasing demand for higher-value and processed agricultural products as countries and their populations get richer. This creates new jobs on the farm, but increasingly also offthe farm, in the expanding agricultural value chains and agribusinesses that is in extended agriculture. The latter effects are currently largely hidden in the numbers as they are largely incorporated in the manufacturing (food processing, machinery) and service (storage, transport, wholesale, retail) sectors of the national accounts.

"Partial separation of the Judiciary from the executive has been achieved.

The legal and administrative framework to achieve this was only put in place in 2007. Successive governments in waiting pledged in their manifestos to effect the separation but once in government, did nothing. The catalyst of the recent move towards independence from the executive was a case brought by over 400 judicial officers in 1995 requesting a ruling on the question of separation of the judiciary from the executive.52 The High Court heard the case in 1997 and gave what is now a historic judgment comprising 12 directives relating to separation of the judiciary.

Trade organizations offer two important finance services under various terms and conditions .	The intangibility of services makes financing somewhat more difficult--given that no form of collateral is involved--and financial institutions may be less willing to provide financial support to your company. However, many public and private institutions will provide financial assistance to creditworthy service exporters. Trade organizations offer two important finance services under various terms and conditions. One is a guarantee program that requires the participation of an approved lender; the other program provides loans or grants to the exporter or a foreign government. Exporters who insure their accounts receivable against commercial credit and political risk loss are usually able to secure financing from commercial banks and other institutions at lower rates and on a more liberal basis than would otherwise be the case.

Such are the questions you will encounter when calculating your personal Ecological Footprint online .	"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month?

Regulation of legitimate commerce to deny traffickers the chemicals they need is one of our most valuable tools in the battle against drug criminals .	"257. Measures to monitor trade in precursor chemicals and prevent their diversion into illicit channels are key components of all strategies to prevent or curb illicit manu facture of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 258. The mechanism for the monitoring of licit trade and the prevention of diversion is laid down in article 12 of the 1988 Convention, which has been complemented over the years by a series of resolutions at various levels of the international drug control system. The fundamental assumption underlying the system of international precursor control is that chemicals that can be used as drug precursors are licit commodities and that any transaction involving them is therefore presumed to be legitimate unless there is suspicion or evidence that the chemical concerned is to be used for illicit purposes. As such, ""the procurement of chemicals necessary to manufacture drugs is one of the few points ... where drug trafficking intersects with legitimate commerce. Regulation of legitimate commerce to deny traffickers the chemicals they need is one of our most valuable tools in the battle against drug criminals.""14 259. INCB has reviewed the achievements, progress and challenges of international precursor control in its annual reports on precursors.15 Over the past 25 years, since the entry into force of the 1988 Convention on 11 November 1990, States have succeeded, through the Convention and the oversight work undertaken by INCB, in substantially reducing the diversion of substances listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 Convention from international trade into illicit drug manufacture. After a quarter of a century, the 1988 Convention enjoys near universal adherence by States worldwide. Through its provisions and requirements, the Convention has served to establish, in 14 Chemical Action Task Force, Status Report for the 1992 Economic Summit (Washington, D.C., June 1992), p. 11. 15 SEE E/INCB/2011/4, E/INCB/2012/4, E/INCB/2013/4 and E/ INCB/2014/4."

Winners and losers Information for a resource scarce world Population is an important factor The big picture High quality of life with fewer resources Ecological traps The poor become poorer Part 2 Ecological accounting Does the second point concern urban structure? Yes, in fact. The way a city is built, how it functions, how spread out or compact it is, how efficient or resource-sparing the energy provision is, all determines the resource efficiency for a city. Urban structure determines at least 80 percent of its residents' Footprint. The Footprint is dependent on where food comes from, how mobile people are, what people buy. Take Houston as an example, a very spread out city in Texas. Its houses are not energy efficient compared to European standards and are poorly insulated. In addition, the houses are widely scattered requiring car trips for even simple errands like getting milk or a newspaper. The residents of Houston use about 12 global hectares of ecologically productive area per person. If someone from Houston moved to Siena, Italy, they would require one-third or quarter of this Footprint to support the same quality of life, because one can reach many places by foot in Siena. Besides, the houses are smaller and more compact. The food is more local and seasonally oriented. In general, Siena offers a charming and attractive life for which one only needs a quarter or a third of the resources. The interesting thing is this: people in Siena don't need to be instructed in having a lower Footprint. It happens because the city structure invites them to live a particular lifestyle. If we enhance Siena with the technological possibilities that we currently have on this planet, even larger Footprint savings would result. For instance, in Italy, a large portion of energy is still produced by coal burning power plants. If this energy were to be produced renewably, or with cleaner technology, Siena's Footprint would shrink without people in Siena having to change anything about their lifestyles.

Participation in primary education is nearly universal Between 1990 and 2012, primary education was extended to an ever increasing proportion of the world's children. Over that period, substantial progress was made towards universal primary education, with the global adjusted net enrolment rate7 in primary education rising from 77 to 90 per cent for girls and from 87 to 92 per cent for boys (figure 3.2). The enrolment of girls in primary education has increased faster than that of boys, which helped to close the gender gap at the primary level. This is particularly true in those regions where girls' enrolment rates were historically much lower than that of boys. Outstanding gains in primary enrolment have been registered in developing regions, particularly in Northern and sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Asia and Oceania. This is largely due to increased investment in primary education and measures taken such as the abolishment of school fees. However, many countries in some of these regions are still far from attaining universal primary education.

This also plays to its potential comparative advantage in cash crop production and takes advantage of the rising demand for high-value and processed agricultural produce following rising incomes and dietary diversification, especially among its large urban population. For the country to grasp these opportunities, agricultural labor productivity will need to be made competitive with off-farm opportunities in the cities. Otherwise the exit of youth out of agriculture, some degree of which is normal, will only accelerate.

Burgeoning industries see greatest demand for English Agriculture , manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade are the main contributors to GDP .	Burgeoning industries see greatest demand for English Agriculture, manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade are the main contributors to GDP. Combined, these industries represent almost 50% of total GDP in Bangladesh, according to the Bangladesh Bank. IT and technology are the fastest growing industries in the country, achieving growth of 8% over 2007-2009. There are marked differences in the development of English between economic sectors. Construction and manufacturing saw the poorest performance in terms of English speaking in the work environment due to a limited requirement for the language in the labour force, while services, banking and technology registered the best performance. According to interviews with companies in these areas, English is essential for communication within and between companies, both within Bangladesh and abroad. English is also used as a common language for internal training in many companies.

The main challenges are related to (self) organization, in time and effort, caused by the unexpected current pandemic situation that has forced us to work from home. It is more demanding to follow (and succeed in) an online course, compared to face-toface course. And the risk of drop-out is much bigger too than in face-to-face courses. Continuous assistance and mentoring are the key to fight these challenges. Partnership would be most welcome to explore one aspect of the project in which an IT specialist is needed, i.e. data science, artificial intelligence, and semantic scholarship. Funding could allow us to hire specific services (e.g. administrative support), and/or to provide for scholarships (e.g. research scholarship). Other types of partnerships are envisioned for instance with political/official stakeholders in education. A strong innovating social entrepreneurship spirit has kept the project self-sustained. The principles of open access and open science we have been following are aligned with the Portuguese national strategy for digital skills (Portugal INCoDe.2030) and, at an international level, particularly with the SDG 4. It all started in only one school. In this school year we have been working with 6 schools. We were reaching only the district of Lisboa, and now we are also reaching the district of Santarem. In the near future, we expect to further replicate the project (e.g. in the United Republic of Tanzania), aiming at continuing to foster the development of digital skills and competences, including ICT and informational, on an individual or global-society scale, ultimately where most needed in close alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

The Ministry of Environment , Science , Technology and Innovation is the sector lead for Environment and Climate Change Issues and works closely with the Environment Protection Agency .	Success factor: policy frameworks, institutional arrangements, financial commitments The concept of FLR was introduced in Ghana when the government supported the establishment of a National Working Group on Forest Landscape Restoration in 2004 to develop a National Plan of Action on FLR to encourage innovative restoration efforts. In addition, a national workshop on International Tropical Timber Organization guidelines for the restoration, management and rehabilitation of degraded and secondary tropical forest was held in Ghana in 2006 (IUCN and Nyame, 2018). The Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation is the sector lead for Environment and Climate Change Issues and works closely with the Environment Protection Agency. Ghana has developed multiple plans and programmes in relation to FLR: Among them are the Forestry Development Master Plan (2016-2040), Youth in Afforestation programme, Ghana Redd+ Strategy (2016-2035), Ghana Forest Plantation Strategy (2016-2040), Ghana Cocoa Forest Redd+ Programme and the joint Framework for action under the Cocoa & Forests Initiative (Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, and Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). Since Ghana's pledge in 2015, the total domestic public expenditure made available for FLR activities totals US$ 10,613,545.52. Total private investment (including microfinance and impact investments) is US$ 16,895,460, which was also supported by a total of international donor support of US$ 55,437,500.

The main analysis in this chapter is based on anonymized firm-level data from the Registrar of Companies for the modern enterprise sectors, collected by the National Statistics Institute (INS). The Registrar of Companies collects information upon incorporation including physical location, sector classification and shareholdings for all shareholders. All registered operating firms are then legally required to submit annual filings to the INS, the tax administration (Direction Generale des Impots, DGI), the court of justice, and the Central Bank (Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, BCEAO) with detailed financial and employment information, which are reported under the West Africa accounting system standards, Systeme Comptable Ouest Africain (SYSCOA).90 Firms hand in hard copies of their forms between March and June following the closing of the fiscal year in December, after which the data are processed by INS.91 The resulting panel dataset, Centrale des Bilans (CdB), covers the years 2003-2012. It spans part of the conflict episodes in 2003-2006, recovery after the Ouagadougou peace accord of 2007, the post-electoral crisis in 2010/2011 and establishment of a new government in 2011. It includes unique firm identification which allows us to track firms over time. The dataset covers the universe of registered firms in all sectors --agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, and services. A major advantage of this dataset is that it does not have a cut-off point in terms of size either by revenue or employment, including one-person firms (firms without employees). While smaller firms --those below certain revenue thresholds --are subject to different tax regimes, they are required to submit financial and employment information in a simplified format. As a result, the data allow us to have a full picture of the formal economy.

Most returned to their countries of origin because of the 2012 crisis, funded by donor States. However, the return and reintegration support that was available was often lacking. The returnees who had previously found success working in urban areas in the Central African Republic were frustrated to find themselves in rural surroundings upon return. When assistance to returnees dried up due to donor interests shifting to the insurgency in the Lake Chad region and resulting displacement, Chad was unable to continue to support returnees, and the reintegration support effectively ended.36 Thailand: Migrants' involvement in emergency management as a driver of integration Although migrants caught by the floods in Thailand were a particularly vulnerable group, they also were active members of their communities, providing relief and clean up services where needed and supporting preparedness, response and recovery efforts. This, in turn, made them feel more integrated in their host community. As one male migrant commented: ""Do you know, I even helped the soldiers and Thai citizens make dams against the flood? I lived like a Thai citizen and felt like I had a responsibility to support neighbours to prevent the flood."" Local Thai CSOs reported the involvement of migrants in supporting the communities they lived in, including support for host community members: ""In Samut Sakhon, some groups of migrant workers tried to form support networks and mobilized monks to collect alms as a fund for relief supplies. These were mostly Burmese, but they did it to support all flood victims, not just their compatriots."" Source: The above is an abridged extract of the Thailand Case Study (Bravi et al., 2017)."

Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants ' journeys .	The IJMBS contributed to the understanding of how the logics of borders are confronted by migrant realities and everyday experiences. Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants' journeys. Being in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move. Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities. In particular, there has been a mounting pressure on the first countries of asylum to double efforts to locally integrate refugees they are hosting. However these countries struggle to meet the social and economic needs of refugees who often face discrimination. As described in an article, the desire to move on with their lives and escape the interminable temporariness in Turkey propelled some Syrian refugees to engage in secondary movements throughout the EU, despite the risks of the journey. For similar reasons, the vast majority of one million refugees who landed in Greece and Italy in 2015-2016, then engaged in secondary movements to escape the temporary status and the exploitative economies of transit. Another contribution shed light on the situation of asylum seekers confined in Indonesia and who hope to be resettled in Australia. It demonstrated that limbo in transit encouraged migrants to agree to assisted voluntary return, in many cases, to places where they may face persecution.

The caretaker government amended rules relating to the appointment, posting, discipline and removal of the judiciary; properly constituted the Judicial Service Commission;78 set up a Judicial Service Pay Commission; and amended the Code of Criminal Procedure to give effect to the separation in the subordinate courts. The current government has since reversed some of this progress, giving back some judicial powers to executive magistrates.79 The GoB's Strategy for Legal and Judicial Reforms (2000), which was designed as a 10-15 year road map for capacity building and reform, appears to have been abandoned. 5.30.

The indicator ""leisure time"" considers the respondent adequate if he or she ranks his or her level of satisfaction equal to or higher than 5, which means he or she is indifferent to or satisfied with the time available for leisure. The percentage of women with adequate leisure time is 65.8 in Bangladesh, 83.1 in Guatemala, and 68.3 in Uganda. As this is a subjective question, it reflects respondents' frames of reference as well as their actual achievements. Male and female reference standards may differ, making gendered and trend comparisons problematic. For example, in Bangladesh men's dissatisfaction with their leisure was higher than women's. In large-scale multipurpose household surveys, a more accurate short time-use module could be used for both time-use questions, and survey administration could be staggered to better capture seasonality."

The main distinguishing features of indigenous peoples' protected areas have to do with the sociopolitical arrangements that are established between indigenous peoples and national authorities for the government of lands and resources in indigenous peoples' lands. Basically such features are that: 1. They are based upon the collective rights of the respective indigenous people, nation or community to lands, territories and resources, under national contexts; 2. They are established as protected areas in application of the right of self-determination, exercised mainly through: * Self-declaration of the protected area by the indigenous people or nation with collective territorial rights on the area; * Free, prior and informed consent of the people, nation or community with territorial rights on the area, in cases where the designation proposal is originated in government agencies, conservation organizations or other actors. 3.

People work their way out of poverty and hardship through better livelihoods. Economies grow as people get better at what they do, as they move from farms to firms, and as more productive jobs are created and less productive ones disappear. Societies flourish as jobs bring together people from different ethnic and social backgrounds and nurture a sense of opportunity.

Source and additional information: www.virtuelles-wasser.de www.waterfootprint.org Part 2 Ecological accounting We know that approximately 26 percent of the Earth's surface provides most of the materials and ecosystem services that humans demand, and that currently there are 2.1 global hectares of biocapacity available per person on the planet. However, the Earth's biosphere does not serve a solely anthropogenic purpose; the same land that supports human existence must also support the existence of other species. If society places a value on biodiversity, we must also reserve biologically productive land and resources for other, nondomesticated species. The Ecological Footprint does not measure biodiversity - it focuses only on the available supply of and demand for biocapacity by humans. But with the Footprint, we can quantify the pressure that humans put on the planet, and better address the root causes of biodiversity loss, including the pressure humans put on the habitat of plant and animal species. We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited.

Notwithstanding increasing globalization , geography is one of the most significant factors shaping patterns of migration and displacement .	The previous chapter provides an overview of migration globally, with specific reference to international stocks and flows. Particular migrant groups - including migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons (IDPs) - as well as remittances, were outlined. Chapter 3 focuses primarily at the regional level in order to provide a more detailed picture of migration, which sets out a different, but complementary, perspective of migrants and movements in different parts of the world.1 Our starting point is geographic, rather than thematic, given that geography is one of the fundamentals underpinning migration today, just as it was in the past. Notwithstanding increasing globalization, geography is one of the most significant factors shaping patterns of migration and displacement. Many people who migrate across borders do so within their immediate regions, to countries that are close by, countries to which it may be easier to travel, that may be more familiar, and from which it may also be easier to return. For people who are displaced, finding safety quickly is paramount. People, therefore, tend to be displaced to safer locations nearby, whether that is within their own countries or across international borders.

This is because the determinants of health are an integral part of many other goals .	Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well being for all persons with disabilities (SDG 3) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (1975) Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (1993) World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons (1982) Goal 3 needs to be interpreted in alignment with other SDGs because of their impact on health. This is because the determinants of health are an integral part of many other goals. A person's state of health is determined by features of the social environment - poverty (Goal 1), hunger (Goal 2), education (Goal 4), work (Goal 8), gender (Goal 5), economic inequality (Goal 10) and peace (Goal 16) - and the physical environment - clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), energy (Goal 7) and climate (Goal 13). The health of persons with disabilities, like everyone's health, is affected by these determinants. Moreover, all of the specified targets of Goal 3 are relevant to persons with and without disabilities. Target 3.8 concerning UHC is of notable importance, because it is the primary mechanism for achieving other Goal 3 targets and because persons with disabilities tend to have less access to health care.

Junior secondary schools no longer exist, as Grades VII and VIII have become the two upper classes of the second cycle of primary education. Secondary education is divided into two cycles: the first (Grades IX and X) or general secondary education, and the second cycle (Grades XI and XII) or preparatory secondary education. Since the education reform, completion of Grade X leads to the Ethiopian School Leaving Certificate Examination (ESLCE). It used to be at the end of Grade XII. The second cycle prepares students to continue their studies at the higher education level or select their profession. It offers a science option and a social science option. At the end of this cycle, students take the Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance examination to enter higher education institutions *Technical and vocational education and training is institutionally separate from the regular education system and runs in parallel with it.

"In order to implement agricultural development policy in deltas that builds farmer resilience, we first need to be able to assess the conditions that create resilience. Increasingly, it is recognized that resilience assessments have two essential components. The first identifies the characteristics of farmers that explain heterogeneous responses to shocks (Carter et al. 2007, Hoddinott and Quisumbing 2010). The second identifies the social, economic, and institutional factors that create feedbacks reproducing this differential response capacity (Bahadur et al. 2013, Bene et al. 2016a). The first of these assessment components identifies ""proximal"" factors that affect or predict the resilience of rice farmers to climate hazards. Knowledge of these proximal factors is important for targeting within agricultural development policy ensuring the resilience of vulnerable groups of farmers is bolstered."

Populations in many countries are ageing rapidly The share of older people ( aged 60 and over ) in the global population has increased over time .	Populations in many countries are ageing rapidly The share of older people (aged 60 and over) in the global population has increased over time. In 2015, the proportion is 12 per cent, compared to 10 per cent in 1995, and is projected to increase to 21 per cent by 2050. The older population itself is also ageing, with the proportion of those aged 80 or older projected to grow from 14 per cent in 2015, to 19 per cent by 2050.3 Population ageing is taking place in all regions and countries, although each of them is at a different stage in the transition. In developed regions, where the transition occurred earlier, the proportion of older persons is currently at 24 per cent. By comparison, in developing regions, the proportion is 10 per cent. Nevertheless, population ageing is also occurring in developing regions and at a faster pace than in developed ones. The same demographic shift experienced by developed regions is expected to take a shorter period of time in developing regions.4 This means that countries in developing regions have much less time to put in place the infrastructure to address the needs of a rapidly expanding older population. A life-course approach to healthy and active ageing is becoming crucial. Continuous participation in and contribution to society, including at older ages, can be supported by promoting healthy behaviours at all ages, preventing and detecting chronic diseases early, encouraging lifelong learning, and gradual retirement at older ages (see Chapters on Health, Education and Work).

The lack of adequate drinking water , sanitation and hygiene are important environmental health risk factors with a tremendous impact on morbidity and mortality for both women and men .	"The lack of adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are important environmental health risk factors with a tremendous impact on morbidity and mortality for both women and men. As noted above, many people do not have access to drinking water sources that are considered improved. In addition, not all sources considered improved provide safe, good quality water. For example, some of the drinking water sources considered ""improved"" may not be adequately maintained and protected from outside contamination, including from naturally occurring elements such as arsenic, pollution from industry and agriculture and from poor sanitation.9 Furthermore, when the source of water is far away, the quantity of safe water that gets collected is less likely to be sufficient for minimum drinking needs or for good hygiene practices.10 It has been shown that the quantity of water that gets collected declines drastically if more than half an hour per trip is needed to collect the water.11 This is often the case in sub-Saharan Africa where 29percent of the population (37percent in rural areas and 14percent in urban areas) are at 30 minutes or more away from an improved source of drinking water.12 The health burden related to water and sanitation remains substantial in developing regions In 2012, an estimated 842,000 people died as a result of diarrhoea caused by inadequate drink- 8 UNICEF and WHO, 2015. 9 UNICEF and who, 2012. 10 UNICEF and who, 2011. 11 ibid. 12 Unweighted averages calculated by the United Nations Statistics Division based on data for 36 countries provided by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, 2014a.

High levels of repetition and drop out hinder a considerable number of children from transitioning to secondary education .	Poverty and other barriers further reinforce gender disparities in learning opportunities The reasons why children do not attend school vary, but they are often associated with poverty, ethnicity, social exclusion, living in a rural area or slum, geographic remoteness, disasters, armed conflict, lack of basic facilities and poor-quality education. These barriers often interact with gender to create even greater disadvantages in learning opportunities. Countries face different challenges and need different policies depending on their circumstances. Among interventions that have successfully been used to reach the disadvantaged and the marginalized, especially girls include: the abolishment of school fees; increased education budgets; social cash transfers, especially to support poor families, making it easier for them to send their children to school; increasing attention to ethnic and linguistic minorities; overcoming conflicts that keep children out of school because of hostilities; and improving the quality of education.15 School progression at the primary level In order to achieve universal completion of primary education, it is important that all boys and girls of primary school age attend school and progress through primary education. High levels of repetition and drop out hinder a considerable number of children from transitioning to secondary education. Difficulty in progressing through the primary grades (repeating) or leaving school before completing the last grade of primary education (dropping out) occur for a variety of reasons, mostly related to the educational system and social and economic factors. Gender plays a significant role in school progression and completion in most countries. 15 UNESCO, 2014a.

Safety and security , in particular , has been a major challenge for the country 's T & T industry .	However, despite these strengths, Brazil has become less competitive since the 2017 edition of the report, dropping five places on the overall global ranking. The chief reason is its deterioration in the aforementioned advantages. While still impressive, a drop in natural (12th) and cultural (10th) digital demand, and in the number of association meetings, potentially indicates waning interest in Brazil's T&T attractiveness. In part, this can be explained by the country's worsening tourist service infrastructure (39th to 59th), price competitiveness (41st to 72nd) and already poor safety and security (106th to 124th). Safety and security, in particular, has been a major challenge for the country's T&T industry. In addition, even with recent improvements, Brazil still has unfavorable business conditions (127th), a constrained human resource and labour market (88th) and underdeveloped ground and port infrastructure (114th), all of which are compounded by the nation's recent economic woes. In general, to meet its full potential, the country needs to prioritize T&T (106th) and maintain its edge in natural and cultural resources, while simultaneously removing business, infrastructure and security barriers. One example of how Brazil is doing this is the country's increased international openness (96th to 89th), stemming from reduced visa requirements (108th to 81st) and better trade integration (78th to 63rd).

The UAE has a very good business environment (9th), human resource and labour market (26th) and safety and security conditions (7th), and is gaining momentum on ICT readiness (15th to 4th). Consequently, the nation has favourable conditions for T&T investment and growth. However, the UAE's biggest edge over average regional competition is its infrastructure, which ranks 13th globally. The country's central location between Europe and Asia, strong business environment and government investment has allowed it to turn into a major global aviation hub, with the fourth highest Air Transport Infrastructure pillar score in the rankings. The UAE also boasts high-quality roads (9th) and ports (9th) and improved tourist service infrastructure (27th to 22nd).

Sectors such as transport, sales, or bar and restaurant activities are more productive than trade (Figure4.14). These sectors are generally more capital intensive. For instance, operators in sales (for example, retails of personal articles, cereals, clothes, and so on) are estimated to be, on average, between 23 to 28 percent more productive than those trading alcohol, juice, and fruits.

Among cash crops , yield growth has also been revived , especially in cotton and cashew , indicating diversification beyond cocoa , though the production of coffee and pineapples declined ( not reported in Figure3.4 ) .	For rice, cotton, and cashew nuts, the productivity increase has started. The overall objectives of the 'Agriculture for Jobs Agenda' are to enhance agricultural labor productivity in existing crops, to diversify the agricultural output mix, and to add value. In recent years, a beginning has been made on each of these fronts. Among staple crops, progress has been especially noticeable for rice, with FAO statistics suggesting annual yield gains in the order of 20 percent (Figure3.4). In light of the much lower yield levels recorded in the micro data, such a growth rate seems somewhat large and deserves further scrutiny.56 Nonetheless, irrespective of the exact growth rate, progress in rice production since the 2008 world food price crisis is real and consistent with concerted government efforts to boost domestic rice production (see section 3.3). Yield growth was negative however among other staple crops (such as roots and tubers). It reflects the longstanding neglect of staple crops in favor of cash crops and presents an area of attention, also in light of the poverty rates among food crop growers. Among cash crops, yield growth has also been revived, especially in cotton and cashew, indicating diversification beyond cocoa, though the production of coffee and pineapples declined (not reported in Figure3.4).

Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agriculture , and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary education or more .	Education influences access to employment opportunities. Education contributes both to the occupations where individuals work, as well as the productivity in these occupations. Patterns of occupational selection are rather strong in Coted'Ivoire. Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agriculture, and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary education or more. The share of nonagricultural self-employment is relatively stable across levels of education, although it slightly decreases at secondary levels and above (Figure1.10). Education is a key determinant of access to certain types of job. As such, stronger gender differences in educational attainment contribute to the strong gender differences in occupation. Box 1.4 further describes the likelihood of employment in the main types of employment given individual characteristics (gender, education) while controlling for other situational factors (social origin, region of residence). Results show that the descriptive patterns of occupational selection by educational level are strong. Chapter6 further discusses the links between education, skills and training, and productive employment in Coted'Ivoire.

These include articles looking at resettlement policy and practice, and analyzing the work of non-governmental and governmental organisations and local authorities in providing arrival support and integration. Interestingly we have published articles that look at the challenges that social workers and civil society organisations face in their work but also papers that look at the integration barriers that migrants and settled refugees face once at the destination country. There is clearly a focus on the gender dimension and particularly on the challenges faced by women, but also on issues of parenting and on the special integration and belonging challenges faced by youth.

However , distances from the port and poor road communication operate against realizing this potential .	There has already been a major impact in production in a very short time. Increased production has impacted negatively, as over-production has already occurred. However, there is potential for increased local consumption, and alternate uses and new products need to be investigated. There is interest, and potential benefit, from developing cottage industries, where peanut products could be used in school feeding projects. The children dislike the powdered milk currently used. The increased production already achieved has stimulated the industry, and raised interest in exports. Traders from Georgetown have shown interest, and sales into these markets have resulted in 20% increases in net returns. However, distances from the port and poor road communication operate against realizing this potential. Farmers, although few women appear to be involved, will benefit from improved food security and higher income through adoption of new technologies.

Diversity matters: Many of the approaches used to prevent and respond to COVID-19 in the most affected areas thus far (e.g., China, Europe and the United States of America) will not be feasible in most humanitarian settings. Numerous humanitarian organizations are creating guidance and tools for the field, but there is a need for more evidence describing how such programs are being adapted according to varying contexts and socio-cultural settings. These adaptations and innovations need to be shared widely so others can learn from them and adopt or modify them according to their specific setting.Time constraint: On the platform, users can click on 'Share field experience' to provide inputs. However, knowing that humanitarian actors are busy in responding to COVID-19 and many will not have the time to respond, we have undertaken interviews with colleagues in the field, and then uploading the content to the website using the standardized forms. The three centres and their belonging universities are partners of the COVID-19 Humanitarian platform project. These provide sufficient research and administrative capacity. However, the nature of the project is to engage local partners to share their experience. In addition, partners with ideas on how to improve the flow of information from the field to the platform are of interest. The project is designed in a way to facilitate self-reporting, so organisations can continue to share their experiences and learning. The knowledge captured will be useful for professionals from the humanitarian sectors and health sectors as COVID-19 evolves and in future epidemics and crisis situations. It is also used for learning in the future in both sectors, as field based experiences can be synthesized and analysed to identify transferable lessons. As the project is with a global coverage, replication should avoid duplication and rather consider pooling efforts.

The current development strategy focuses on agricultural and crop diversification through reallocation of resources away from the production of rice , to be achieved through a continuous increase in the productivity of land and labor , and timely supply of high-quality seeds and fertilizer .	Agriculture, the main occupation of the people, employs 63% of the active labor force. It contributed 30% to GDP in 2000, 57% of which came from crop production. Rice accounts for about 77% of total cropped area and two-thirds of the value added in crop production. The emphasis of government policy and research has been on achieving food grain production self-sufficiency with positive support for the distribution of modern agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilizers and irrigation water. This policy support and major achievements of the publicsector research and extension agencies have enabled the country to achieve a record 5% per year growth in cereal production from 1996 to 2000.

The previous chapter provides an overview of migration globally, with specific reference to international stocks and flows.

Chapter 3 focuses primarily at the regional level in order to provide a more detailed picture of migration, which sets out a different, but complementary, perspective of migrants and movements in different parts of the world.1 Our starting point is geographic, rather than thematic, given that geography is one of the fundamentals underpinning migration today, just as it was in the past. Notwithstanding increasing globalization, geography is one of the most significant factors shaping patterns of migration and displacement. Many people who migrate across borders do so within their immediate regions, to countries that are close by, countries to which it may be easier to travel, that may be more familiar, and from which it may also be easier to return. For people who are displaced, finding safety quickly is paramount. People, therefore, tend to be displaced to safer locations nearby, whether that is within their own countries or across international borders.

The effects of protracted conflict have often been different for men, women, and girls in South Sudan. South Sudan has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world (Cone 2019, 9). Research found that in several conflict zones in the country, up to 65 percent of women and girls had experienced some form of physical and sexual violence (Global Women's Institute and International Rescue Committee 2017, 12). Since the onset of the 2013 conflict, women and children have accounted for approximately 85 percent of the displaced persons (UNFPA 2019). In addition, traditional communal gender roles are rigid in South Sudan. Women are generally expected to occupy the private space rather than assuming leadership and decision-making roles in the public sphere. These strict gender roles, the high illiteracy rates among women, and high rates of child, early, and forced marriage have all limited women's participation in the humanitarian sector.

Jobs in enterprises that produce wind mills for electricity generation, construct water and soil conservation systems, and plant and manage trees fall in this category. These are often called green jobs, with different definitions attached to the term. Industries matching the most common definitions of green jobs tend to be relatively small in many developing countries, with Brazil and China notable exceptions (box 5.6).58 Pending a precise quantification of environmental spillovers from jobs, it is likely that the activities with the greatest potential to mitigate adverse environmental damage in develop- for cost efficiency, bringing smaller local companies into the value chain. Contracting out provides opportunities for small and microenterprises to also reap the benefits of knowledge spillovers.52 Research can also shed light on the obstacles preventing the productivity spillovers from globally integrated jobs from materializing. Crosscountry analysis shows that the degree of labor market flexibility, barriers to firm entry, and infrastructure development substantially influence the impact of openness on growth.53 Knowledge spillovers hinge on the ability of the local economy to absorb them--human capital and research and development capacity are important. Local firms need a certain level of production and technological capabilities to be selected as suppliers by foreign companies. When technology gaps between local firms and foreign companies are large, productivity spillovers are less likely to occur.54 Environmental impacts. Jobs that overuse natural resources or damage the environment are less productive than their direct output might suggest. The environmental damage they create imposes a negative spillover on others, resulting in a lower net contribution to aggregate output. Natural resources such as the atmosphere, water, forests, and soil provide services useful for economic activities and necessary for human life, but they are often overused because their cost from a private point of view falls short of their true social cost.55 The emission of greenhouse gases is an example of a negative spillover.

In this context , it is essential to better understand the dynamics of employment in formal enterprises , and the constraints to the creation of formal jobs .	Given the higher-quality of jobs in the modern formal sector, expanding the size of the formal sector is key to more and better jobs. As indicated in the analysis in Chapter1, Coted'Ivoire's main employment challenge stems from the concentration of employment in informal and low-productivity occupations. An analysis of the employment profile illustrates a very low share of wage employment among the employed population. In particular, less than 4 percent of the employed population holds formal private wage jobs. In this context, it is essential to better understand the dynamics of employment in formal enterprises, and the constraints to the creation of formal jobs. This is also particularly relevant as the formal sector constitutes a large share of aggregate value added in the economy.

The Ecological Footprint of carbon dioxide emissions is calculated by assuming that all emissions must be taken up by forests. This neglects biotic carbon uptake in other biomes, which if included might affect the estimated Ecological Footprint per unit of carbon dioxide emissions. * Bioproductivity occupied by hydroelectric reservoirs and other infrastructure. These areas are assumed to have world average productivity. Greater specificity would be desirable. * Ecological tradeoffs of land conversion. By the current National Footprint Accounts methodology, loss of forest cover to urbanization may provide counter-intuitive results in biocapacity. This is due to a lack of geographic specificity. All cropland is assigned the global average equivalence factor, weighted by yield. This means that if national average yields are not substantially affected, newly added cropland hectares may be assigned a higher biocapacity than the land cover they replace. In addition, all land occupied by infrastructure is assumed to have the biocapacity per hectare of cropland, rather than of the land cover it has displaced. * Aquaculture production. Aquaculture production systems are not currently included in the National Footprint Accounts. Aquaculture fish and wild catch are aggregated in trade data, so the Footprint of consumption may be underestimated for large exporters of aquaculture fish and overestimated for large importers of aquaculture fish.

Secondary education covers six years divided into two three-year cycles: grades 7 to 9 in middle school (Maktabeh Motevaseteh) and grades 10 to 12 at high school (Doreyeh Aali). At the end of the first cycle, pupils sit for an examination. At the end of the second cycle, they sit for intra-school examinations. Technical secondary education is offered in the lower and upper secondary cycle at middle schools in such subjects as Commerce, Applied Arts, Teacher Training, Agriculture and Civil Aviation.

Rice around the world 111 Recent developments in the rice sector Myanmar has a predominantly agricultural economy based on rice production. The agricultural sector, including livestock and fisheries, accounts for 53% of the country's GDP. Rice is the single most important crop, grown on 6.0 million ha or about two-thirds of the country's total cultivated area. Rice production employs 40% of the total labor force and consumes 70% of total commercial fertilizers. Rice maintains its position as the main staple food crop, accounting for 97% of total food grain production. The importance of rice as a major foreign exchange earner, however, has declined over time. Before World War II, Myanmar was the largest riceexporting country in the world. However, because of stagnation of production since the early 1960s, Thailand took the place of Myanmar in the export market, as exports declined from 1.7 million t in 1962 to 0.3 million t in 1975. Annual exports had fluctuated from 0.5 to 0.9 million t during 1976- 86, a period of respectable growth in rice production. Exports in recent years have fallen below 100,000 t. Myanmar has the capacity to substantially increase rice exports, but it is constrained by poor grain quality, inadequate processing and marketing infrastructure, and an underdeveloped trading system.

Finding funding is a major concern, although the government has adopted many initiatives to involve private players. For example, the government opened the country up to foreign universities, which will undoubtedly help re-shape the educational landscape. According to the Bangladesh Ministry of Education, major reforms undertaken by the government in order to improve education include: * Introduction of unitrack curriculum in secondary-level education from 2006; * School-based assessment (SBA) in secondary-level education; * Reform of existing examination systems in secondary-level education; * Privatisation of textbook writing and publication; * Formation of oversight committee for the supervision of teaching in classrooms; * Strengthening of teacher training; * Delivery of textbooks to students on time; * Modernisation of secondary, technical and Madrasah (Islamic primary school) curricula; * Distribution of 20,000 computers to secondary-level educational institutions, including Madrasah; * Training of secondary-level teachers in computer applications. Individuals represent prime source of demand According to Euromonitor's research, one of the main drivers of demand for English education comes from individuals. This is mainly due to the perception that English can aid personal economic growth and provide better career prospects, with the chance to escape poverty.

How do you categorise World Heritage sites and Biosphere reserves? All new and most existing natural World Heritage sites are protected areas and comply with the IUCN definition of a protected area. So are some cultural sites, especially World Heritage Cultural Landscapes. Some countries have older natural World Heritage sites that are not regarded as protected areas or contain parts that are outside protected areas. Categories should be assigned in a similar manner to other protected areas whilst noting the special emphasis that is given to managing to maintain the site's outstanding universal value as the basis for inscription. The IUCN definition should equally be applied to Man and Biosphere Reserves as part of the category assignment process. In most cases this would apply to core areas and in many cases also to buffer zones (often with different categories); however, transition zones are often managed for purposes of sustainable use and may not comply (see 2008 Guidelines, Chapter 7, for discussion of the categories and international designations).

Developing economies require access to English There are a number of clear unifying factors between the countries selected for this research despite their diverse geographical location. All are developing nations, attempting to set in place growth strategies and reposition themselves in the new global economy. An important element of these growth strategies is recognition of the importance of English, in order to communicate in the international business world. A focus on improved language skills has helped to attract more foreign investment, further increasing the need for English speakers in these countries. This underpins the growth of national and individual wealth, and helps drive economic development. Workers with solid English language skills are therefore in the best position to take the fullest advantage of new opportunities in these rapidly developing economies. Demand for English language education is driven by a number of factors. These include inward investment (with international companies typically using English for internal communication), ambitious individuals looking to sharpen their competitive edge in the labour market, as well as government efforts to encourage business investment by allocating greater budgets to the teaching of English.

For example , in 2017 , it enacted a law , On State Support of Cinematography , to address prominent online marketplaces facilitating piracy and counterfeiting that continue to be hosted in , or operated from , Ukraine .	Ukraine remained on the Priority Watch List in the annual Special 301 Report in 2018. This designation reflects the continuing need to address the inadequate protection and enforcement of IPR and remedy the related market access barriers to U.S. exports and investment. Ukraine has taken several positive steps to improve the protection and enforcement of IPR. For example, in 2017, it enacted a law, On State Support of Cinematography, to address prominent online marketplaces facilitating piracy and counterfeiting that continue to be hosted in, or operated from, Ukraine. The 2017 law, despite limitations, was a sign of progress in the fight against online piracy in Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine has engaged in enforcement actions in the last two years aimed at combatting online piracy. Due to concerns that Ukraine was not providing adequate and effective protection of IPR and, in particular, the unfair and nontransparent administration of collective management organizations (CMOs) in Ukraine, the United States suspended a portion of Ukraine's GSP benefits in April 2018. Ukraine subsequently adopted a law in July 2018 to reform its CMO system. While the law is an improvement, it fails to remedy many shortcomings in the previous CMO system, including concerns about the governance of CMOs, the method for calculating royalty rates, payment of royalties for cable retransmissions, risk of overlapping CMOs, and the accreditation procedures to establish a CMO. Draft laws pertaining to patents and geographical indications (GIs) are also of concern. Industry has raised concerns with the introduction of draft patent legislation containing provisions on compulsory licensing and restrictive patentability criteria particularly. The draft legislation on GIs falls short on transparency and adequate safeguards for generic terms and prior trademarks. Finally, concerns with the widespread use of unlicensed software by the Ukrainian government remain, but a recently adopted Cabinet of Ministers resolution requiring government agencies to stop using unlicensed software by the end of 2019 appears promising. The U.S. Government continues to press Ukraine to improve all aspects of its protection and enforcement of IPR.

These livelihoods are susceptible to losses from climate hazards and do not generate resources that farmers can utilize in response to climate impacts. This is a partial explanation as to why rice farmers lack resilience; it does not answer what led to this state occurring nor fully explain why it persists. To understand why such a state persists it is necessary to identify the underlying contextual drivers of this situation. We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional, social, cultural, and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming. Our research suggested that these underlying contextual drivers were (i) the institutions surrounding land ownership, (ii) the nature of formal institutional support, (iii) lack of employment diversity, and (iv) expenses related to cultural activities.

In Sierra Leone, the government has redeployed hospital staff and CHWs to be trained in case management and contact tracing. Health system resources were already strained, so this reassignment of staff is likely to significantly reduce the availability of non-COVID-19 services. In early March, even before the first case was confirmed in the country, the EOC registered reduced patient attendance at routine services. Similar effects were seen during the Ebola outbreak in 2013 to 2016, with disastrous effects on maternal and neonatal health (Sochas et al., 2017), as well as malaria, TB, and HIV treatment (Parpla et al., 2016). Similar effects on non-maternity reproductive health services have been examined earlier; routine childhood immunisation is also expected to fall due to lack of remaining staff and resources, compounded by international supply bottlenecks. As well as staff shortages, use of services may have been reduced by patient fear of acquiring COVID-19 and by health staff reducing patient attendance in an attempt to decongest facilities.

Using this as a benchmark, private schools clearly provide a better education and more effective teaching of English than public schools. Public schools suffer from lack of funding, meaning that English tuition is of lower quality. Although high-quality English tuition remains restricted to the wealthier parts of the population, the government is promoting countrywide usage of the language. As such, the gap in the cost of private and public education in Pakistan is pronounced.	Public schools suffer from lack of funding, meaning that English tuition is of lower quality.

A neighborhood of 5,000 outside the city of Tangerang, Indonesia, started coming to life 25 years ago, when iron, rubber, garment, and thread factories sprang up in the surrounding areas. Some in the neighborhood still work as farmhands. But most women and men earn their living in the factories, as well as in a variety of jobs that rose up alongside them. Many men drive ojeks (motorcycle taxis); women sell sweets and other items by the gates of the factories. Residents also make a living through home-based garment piecework, handicrafts such as broom-making, and construction work; some are civil servants and teachers. Poorer women collect and resell scraps of fabric. The flow of newcomers has also offered an income-generating opportunity to local families from renting rooms for lodging.

Six of the eight projects evaluated in this area by the 2000 EEP review were continued into the 2001-2006 period. One project on utilization of wild Arachis species was discontinued, although some aspects were transferred to a similar, existing project. In addition, two projects were added to the Production Efficiency portfolio bringing the total to eight. Three projects involve biotechnology, including the development of molecular markers, and transformation of germplasm for disease resistance using pathogen-derived resistance. Four projects are using conventional means for genetic enhancement, and have concentrated on the deployment of technologies such as improved varieties, production practices, harvesting, and post-harvest operations. Two projects have concentrated on the development of integrated pest management (IPM) practices, characterization of production constraints, development of models for risk management, and the transfer of these technologies to research and extension agencies, and to farmers. 2.2.2 outputs and achievements. In most cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies and interventions. Improved production practices, including site and seed selection, agronomic practices, pest and disease control, and harvest practices have led to yield increases in most host countries. Improved varieties and useful germplasm have been developed or identified in a number of projects: (1) Bolivian germplasm collected and evaluated (UFL16) has led to the identification of useful resistances to TSWV, leaf spots, rust, white mold and invasion by Aspergillus flavus. These have been used in crosses and two derivatives have been included in UPPT (pre-release) tests in the U.S.A. One could be released in the U.S.A. in 2006, and a release from these crosses can soon be expected in Bolivia as well. In Bolivia a line introduced from the USA has been released.

"Similar considerations apply to the evidence supporting a "" rural pipeline "" approach , with health education institutions established preferentially in rural areas and opportunities for practical training in rural areas ( 91 ) ."	"The systematic review of reviews found that CHW training should include a mix of approaches (knowledge and skills based) (17, 86, 87). 7.4.4 Interpretation of the evidence and other considerations by the GDG The broader literature on effective training approaches published in other sectors points to one-off theory and discussion-based trainings as being only moderately helpful in increasing the knowledge of practitioners, and they are generally ineffective in practical skill building that is of measurable benefit in real-world practice settings (88). Substantial changes in practice behaviour could first be observed when on-the-job coaching and continuous feedback was used to support practitioners. This broader literature may be of value when considering the development of practice guidelines for CHWs in this area (89, 90). The GDG considered that the evidence base from other health occupational groups - showing that a balance between theoretical and practical training is associated with positive outcomes - can be assumed to apply also to CHWs. Similar considerations apply to the evidence supporting a ""rural pipeline"" approach, with health education institutions established preferentially in rural areas and opportunities for practical training in rural areas (91). Efforts should also be made to ensure that digital health education approaches complement, rather that replace, traditional face-to-face instructional modalities (92). 7.4.5 Implementation considerations Countries will need to identify the appropriate balance in their context between theoretical and practical training, taking into account a variety of factors, including the pre-existing literacy and educational attainment of trainees. The use of dynamic teaching methodologies, as well as the use of multimedia resources, have the potential to make the training more attractive and effective. The role of simulated practice may be considered for skills development and in areas where exposure to practical training in communities or health facilities may present logistical or operational challenges."

Both in China and in Germany, a considerable reduction of carbon emissions could significantly reduce the ecological deficit. Due to the high degree of urbanization in both countries, infrastructure investments that lead to a reduction in resource consumption will be important. trade and the ecological Footprint Both China and Germany are reliant on net imports from other countries to balance their ecological deficits. China has developed into a global hub for product manufacturing. Its trade relations are characterized by raw material imports (e.g., metals and wood from Latin America, oil and cotton from Africa, or wool from Australia), of which only a quarter remain in the country. Changing Chinese consumption habits that have accompanied an improved standard of living (such as increasing meat and milk consumption) are demanding a growing number of imports, namely, agricultural and grazing land products. Although a major portion of resources leave China again in the form of finished products (e.g., paper, furniture or textiles) for the USA, Japan, Australia, South Korea and the EU, overall imports exceeded exports in 2005; the trade balance in this year was negative. Germany, on the other hand, had a positive trade balance and exported more than was imported in 2005; the German Footprint of consumption was 0.4 gha per capita smaller than the production Footprint.

A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).

Global trends: Colorectal cancer trends vary substantially worldwide, even within levels of HDI. Incidence rates are decreasing in some very high-HDI countries, such as the US, Israel, and Japan.69 These countries have had widespread uptake of screening programs and early-detection programs since the 1990s, which resulted not only in decreasing mortality, but also in decreasing incidence due to the detection and removal of precancerous lesions. In other very high-HDI countries with decreasing incidence and no longstanding screening programs, such as Australia, New Zealand, and some European countries, decreasing incidence is likely due to favorably changing risk factors.69 In contrast, incidence rates are increasing in other very high-HDI countries including Sweden, Italy, and Slovenia, as well as several lower-HDI countries undergoing rapid human development transition, likely due to increased prevalence of risk factors such as unhealthy diet, obesity, and smoking.69 The most rapid increases of about 3% or more annually over the past 10 years are in high-HDI countries such as Costa Rica (men); Brazil (women); and Colombia and Bulgaria (both sexes).69 In contrast to the 18 Global Cancer Facts & Figures 4th Edition Global Cancer Facts & Figures 4th Edition 19 wide variation in incidence trends, colorectal cancer mortality rates have been decreasing in many countries worldwide, particularly very high-HDI countries, likely due to improvements in treatment and early detection.

The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association is in discussion with a coalition of UN agencies and other organisations to upgrade production facilities , while sourcing certified virus-proof fabric from China ( Dhaka Tribune , 2020 ) .	In Bangladesh, there are no provisions in the national preparedness plan for any emergency supply chain management. Instead, procurement continues to use forecasts by the respective hospital directorate office. While there was adequate stock of consumables and drugs at the beginning of the outbreak, logistics surge capacity is limited. However, the government has procured 1.5 million items of PPE from international and national markets by 24 April, with more in the pipeline. After distribution, the PPE inventory as at 24 April amounted to 0.27 million items. The procurement department is presently struggling to procure a standards-compliant particulate respirator (N-95 or equivalent) internationally, reflecting the global shortage of quality PPE. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has started converting existing production capabilities to PPE equipment locally. Given present limitations of access to virus-proof fabric, local factories can only produce waterproof equipment, which has obtained government approval for the intended level of protection. This lower-grade equipment has been deployed for use by support workers, leaving valuable virus-proof resources for frontline workers.

Integrate disability-inclusive education into the curriculum and training for health professionals. Involve persons with disabilities in the design and provision of training, to the extent possible. Develop strategies for holistic, people-centred care so as to improve the quality and continuity of care for persons with disabilities. 5) Empower persons with disabilities to take control over their own health-care decisions, on the basis of free and informed content. Ensure access to and accessibility of health-related information, including through alternate means of communication accessible to persons with disabilities. Disseminate health information through training of persons with disabilities and peer support, so that persons with disabilities are better prepared to make decisions about their own health and become aware of the healthcare services they can benefit from. 6) Prohibit discriminatory practices in health insurance and promote health insurance schemes offering coverage for assistive products and rehabilitation services. Private and public insurance schemes should not limit the availability of coverage for pre-existing conditions. These discriminatory practices disproportionately affect persons with disabilities. In addition, discriminatory practices on the basis of disability should be prohibited.

In this context , links between gender and environment have been assessed most often based on qualitative or small-scale quantitative studies .	Box 7.1 Gaps in gender statistics related to the environment Environment statistics is a relatively new statistical fielda that describes the biophysical aspects of the environment--the natural environment (air/climate, water, land/soil), the living organisms within these media, and human settlementsb--and those aspects of social and economic systems that directly influence and interact with the environment.c This field of statistics, considered gender-neutral, was initially developed without much consideration of the dimensions related to individuals. In this context, links between gender and environment have been assessed most often based on qualitative or small-scale quantitative studies. Such assessments are useful in highlighting the socially constructed vulnerabilities and challenges faced by women and men and in providing information on the importance of integrating a gender perspective in policymaking. The extrapolation of their results, however, to the level of a whole society or across countries may lead to misconceptions about the status of women relative to men in different settings.

But it's hard to imagine in the United States or anywhere else businesspeople meeting for the first time or even after several times and engaging in head touching or hair messing. So by all means read the literature and talk with people who know the culture. But don't be intimidated and don't be reluctant to meet people. And do keep these general rules in mind.	So by all means read the literature and talk with people who know the culture.	A Basic Guide to Exporting, 11th Edition	Doug Barry	2015

At the beginning of the reform process, cities and towns could afford basic social welfare only for a limited population. Inflows of rural workers were therefore seen as a double-edged sword that could increase the well-being of rural residents but also lead to congestion and overcrowded infrastructure.

The institutional capacity and independence of formal oversight functions (e.g. C&AG, ACC, Election commission, PSC) have been systematically diluted. Although Bangladesh has a free press and active civil society, there is an overall lack of citizen empowerment to hold the government to account. Corruption is notable in sectors such as land, police, education, health, the judiciary and financial services. As a result, the social contract between the State and the wider public and the quality of public service delivery have been undermined.7 A more detailed picture of the role of these actors (state and non-state) in the process of tackling corruption is provided in Section 2.

Productivity studies can help quantify the spillovers from employment in FDI companies , in firms connected to global markets , or in functional cities .	Misaligned incentives exist when good jobs for development are not rewarding enough to individuals or profitable enough to farms and firms. Data and analysis can be used to identify gaps between the individual and the social value of jobs. Arguably, many key areas in development economics deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can be applied to measure the tax burden on capital and labor and to assess the extent of cross-subsidization between individuals or firms. Labor economics methods can be used to uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kinds of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on poverty reduction.

Design could mean the creation of artefacts , it could mean problem-solving activity , it could mean a way of reasoning , reflecting and creating meaning ( Johansson-Skoldberg et al ., 2013 ) .	"69. Design has been defined in many ways. Design could mean the creation of artefacts, it could mean problem-solving activity, it could mean a way of reasoning, reflecting and creating meaning (Johansson-Skoldberg et al., 2013). For the purpose of developing a curriculum for entrepreneurship, Boni et al. (2009, p.409) defined design as ""a process of actions and decisions aimed at producing products, services, environments, and systems that addresses a problem and improves people's lives"", i.e. an inherently action-based approach to value creation. Brown (2008) pictures design thinking as a team-based iterative three-step process of 1) being inspired by the world through observing it closely looking for problems and opportunities, 2) brainstorming around plausible ideas for concepts that can help people and 3) testing these ideas on users through prototypes. Design thinking focuses on a creative search for what might be, instead of being limited by what is and what ""should"" be (Dunne and Martin, 2006). For teachers, design thinking represents yet another field where an emerging set of practices, tools and methods could be transferred and contextualized to an educational setting, supporting student learning and creativity. Students can ask themselves questions such as ""How can we observe people in their authentic environment and reflect on their needs?"" and ""How can we solve their problems differently from anyone else?""."

Audiopedia Corona Awarenesses WhatsApp Campaign URIDU Civil Society, Germany https://www.uridu.org & https://www.audiopedia.org/corona The coronavirus affects all of our lives. However, in the poorest countries it will be devastating. Especially for women and girls, who will be on the frontlines of the response.Knowledge about symptoms, transmission, and prevention of COVID-19 is vital. But how can we provide this information to marginalized, often illiterate populations? The audio recording of localized messages and their distribution via WhatsApp is an efficient and timely solution, not only to spread accurate information, but also to counter fake news.Audiopedia is a non-profit project that makes health knowledge audible. For this project we set up a global Corona Awareness Campaign using WhatsApp Audio which currently includes +62 translations and audio recordings in more than 30 languages (see https://www.audiopedia.org/corona/). The campaign provides easily shareable text and audio information on a dedicated web site, which has been optimized for mobile web (www.audiopedia.io/corona). Both smartphones and smart feature phones can access the contents, people can share to WhatsApp with just one click. To ensure credibility of the messages we are cooperating with NGOs that work in health education, disaster risk management, and social and behavior change communication. Being a member in relevant networks enables us to be able to reach out to thousands of NGOs that can act as multiplicators with high credibility among the local population. NGOs can become part of our Audiopedia NGO Network (https:// www.audiopedia.org/ngo) to coordinate their efforts with us.

In the future , the service sector will loom even larger in the U.S. economy .	In the future, the service sector will loom even larger in the U.S. economy. Small and mediumsized entrepreneurial companies--those employing fewer than 500 employees--overwhelmingly lead this service-driven business expansion. More than 4 million small U.S. service companies account for more than 16 million jobs. Although small service companies make up most of the service sector, many of the most prominent U.S. service exporters are large companies. Seven of the 30 companies that constitute the widely cited Dow Jones Industrial Average are service companies.	In the future, the service sector will loom even larger in the U.S. economy.

Given the focus of the Rwandan Government on developing a high-tech economic base that requires strong competence in English, its membership of the Commonwealth and East African Community, and the current high spend on education, demand for English from both government and private companies will be high.

In ecology , resilience is the degree to which a system can adapt , learn , and self-organize ( Walker et al. 2004 ) .	Central to the notion of resilience is the ability of a system to absorb shocks or stresses while maintaining existing structure and function (Folke 2006). In ecology, resilience is the degree to which a system can adapt, learn, and self-organize (Walker et al. 2004). Resilience to disasters is the ability to manage change, by maintaining or transforming living standards in the face of shocks without compromising long-term prospects (DFID 2011). Recognizing the strength of resilience as a concept to guide understanding of system response to change and exogenous shocks, researchers and policy makers are utilizing the concept to address development challenges (Barrett and Constas 2014, Bene et al. 2016b). In this context, the concept of resilience has been adapted to be cognizant of issues such as marginality, power, and agency and associated social and institutional structures that the vulnerability literature has flagged as being important to explain differential susceptibility to harm (Bene et al. 2012, 2014, Tanner et al. 2015). Recent definitions of resilience, adopted herein, describe it as a capacity, possessed by a unit, e.g. household, community, or country, to maintain or improve standards of living while facing an uncertain risk landscape (Barrett and Constas 2014).	In ecology, resilience is the degree to which a system can adapt, learn, and self-organize (Walker et al. 2004).	Resilience to hazards: rice farmers in the Mahanadi Delta, India	John M.

"The presentation of these experiences leads to a discussion of the descriptive categories of these "" mobilities "" and "" elites "" ."	"Contemporary situations are also examined through the lens of history, which makes it possible to grasp ruptures and continuities and to develop comparative perspectives. This was the case in the dossier on ""Romanian Roma migration in Europe: inclusion policies, strategies for distinguishing and (de)building identity borders"" coordinated by Mihaela Nedelcu and Ruxandra-Oana Ciobanu (32/1, 2016). It is also the perspective adopted in the dossier ""Migratory movements of yesterday and today in Italy"" coordinated by Paola Corti and Adelina Miranda (34/1, 2018) which critically reviews Italy's migratory history, at a time when this country is becoming increasingly present on the international scene due to policies of refoulement of foreigners at national borders. The analysis of the Italian case suggests, in the wake of the migration studies, that it is not possible to define the migration fields within which old and new protagonists move through the simple analysis of territorial trajectories. The research presented shows, on the one hand, that the adoption of a distant perspective is essential to relativize current analyses and, on the other hand, it shows the heuristic interest in varying the focus of the historical perspective on migration facts. Similarly, since it is no longer conceivable to use categories that semantically reflect the typologies used by a political discourse that instrumentalize them, it is useful to consider the various spatial-political scales - local, regional, national and international - while appropriating the subjective level to understand the complexity of the phenomenon. This historical perspective is also present in the dossier ""Training elites: mobility of students from Africa north of the Sahara in the countries of the former socialist bloc"" coordinated by Michele Leclerc-Olive and Marie-Antoinette Hily (32/2, 2016), which sheds light on a forgotten part of our history, examines collaboration between countries in the name of an ideological project, and the ""qualified migration"" that these programmes generate between these States.

In all pilot surveys and case studies, informed consent pages were translated into local languages, and copies were left with respondents so that they retained the contact information for the study. 17 Particular care was taken in modifying informed consent for the case study narrative, as the case studies included photographs and in some cases video footage. To protect the identity of the case study respondents, pseudonyms are used in the presentation of results.

A Ugandan man, age 46, says, ""People who are empowered 'see change in their lives.'"" Naturally, context and culture also shape one's definition of empowerment. In Uganda, women interviewed in the qualitative case studies related empowerment as the ability to improve quality of life, whether fiscally or in relation to autonomy, or as decision-making capacity and tended to define empowerment as ""someone who is independent."" Women in Guatemala generally defined empowerment as ""decision-making capability"" and ""equality"" with men. For example, a 63-year-old woman said, ""Being empowered, it means that the woman can do things too, not just the man."" Women in Bangladesh tended to view empowerment more narrowly, related to their financial position, as directly resulting from ""having money"" and assets as well as cooperatively ""succeeding"" at work. In Bangladesh, individuals cited a communal, rather than a singular, understanding of empowerment focused on the family unit rather than the individual woman or man--which includes the ability to work jointly and well together. Therefore, doing work and income-generating activities successfully empowers not just an individual but an entire family (Becker 2012)."

Sectors that are relatively more capital intensive tend to be more productive. The heterogeneity in household enterprises is reflected by strong variation in productivity across types of activities. Sectors such as transport, sales, or bar and restaurant activities are more productive than trade (Figure4.14). These sectors are generally more capital intensive. For instance, operators in sales (for example, retails of personal articles, cereals, clothes, and so on) are estimated to be, on average, between 23 to 28 percent more productive than those trading alcohol, juice, and fruits. These estimates are highly statistically significant (Figure4.15; Table C.3, in AnnexC).	These sectors are generally more capital intensive.

Of course , it is not easy to foresee how technology will unfold , so any decision involves uncertainty .	Apart from spillovers, recent work in the economics of clean-energy innovation has emphasized that optimal policy may be quite different in the long term simply because expenditures today may have long-term effects. Some of the approaches to reducing emissions that are more expensive in the short term may spur innovation that could lead to lower long-term costs than existing approaches. Consider December 2019 | FINANCE & DEVELOPMENT 11 THE ECONOMICS OF CLIMATE subsidies for electric vehicles, which include rapidly improving technology such as batteries. If policy today for clean technology can reduce costs substantially in the future, then it may make sense to undertake more expensive options today (Acemoglu and others 2016; Vogt-Schilb and others 2018). In principle, this finding holds even if only a single firm adopts the low-carbon innovation (so there would be no innovation spillovers), although in practice there will almost certainly be spillovers leading to lower long-term costs. The key insight is that when society chooses how best to address climate change, the optimal long-term decision may differ from the short-term, myopic decision. Of course, it is not easy to foresee how technology will unfold, so any decision involves uncertainty. But we know that mature technologies are less likely to see major leaps than nascent ones. Thus, the long-term view applies only to newer low-carbon technologies with real potential to reduce costs in the future.

However, it found no misconduct or responsibility for human rights violations during the state of emergency. In June, legislation was passed to create ""zones of special operations"" as part of a crime prevention plan. INDECOM hosted a Caribbean Use of Force Conference to develop a region-wide Use of Force Policy consistent with best practice in human rights. Law enforcement officials from across the region participated in the forum, along with experts in policing and human rights."	During the year, 168 people were killed by law enforcement officials, compared with 111 people in 2016.

Ninth, development of rural areas and secondary towns in Coted'Ivoire is further called for to productively absorb labor exiting agriculture. At first sight, the rural employment structure is broadly consistent with current development. About four in five rural workers work in agriculture, which is consistent with the ratios observed in other countries at similar levels of development (Figure2.10).47 Yet only a very small (and relatively 44 Detailed analysis of the national accounts showed that while the value added in agriculture was estimated at 17.5, 6.5, and 2.5 percent, in Nicaragua (2006), Peru (2007), and Chile (2008), respectively, the value of forward and backward linkages added 5.2, 3.2, and 2.2 percentage points (Anriquez 2016), with the share of these linkages in the total value added by agriculture (production and linkages) increasing as countries become richer (Nicaragua, 1,849 (2010 US$) GDP/capita, in 2015; Peru (5,974 (2010 US$) GDP/capita in 2015; Chile 14,626 (2010 US$) GDP/capita in 2015) and the value added in agriculture declined. 45 Surprisingly, there is not much difference across age cohorts. Much of the occupational transformation usually happens through younger age cohorts, who are more skilled and flexible. 46 When asked about the type of business they would like to run in the future, about 60 percent of people employed in agriculture aspire to run a farm. When asked about the type of job they would like, more than 80 percent of those currently employed in agriculture, indicate to be aspiring a job outside agriculture. 47 Davis, Di Giuseppe, and Zezza (2015).

More evidence of corruption can, perversely, be an indication of success: systems working better detect more of it. 10. Projects must be prepared to respond swiftly and repeatedly to opportunities as they arise. This principle is successfully utilised by TIB in their work to reduce corruption in public service institutions, such as hospitals and schools. Community watchdogs monitor the institutions after a TIB intervention. If improvements are not sustained, TIB will intervene repeatedly until the reforms are sustained. Entry points for intervention need to be chosen carefully. 11. Development partners need to focus on prevention of corruption by continuing their support to civil society: to strengthen, meet and make visible the population's desire to end corruption. The desire for change needs to come from citizens. civil society is a significant driver of change in Bangladesh. 12. Experience with TIB also shows the importance of pressure from civil society. Pressure from civil society can curb government action or force the government's arm. For example pressure from civil society forced the government's arm in setting up the Human Rights Commission and entrenching the powers of the Comission more firmly than those of the ACC under the ACC Act. 13. The lack of results in governance reforms can be blamed on both sides. The lack of continuity, coupled with the lack of high quality technical advisory support, means that donor-funded projects in public sector reforms do not get enough buy-in. At the same time, GoB knows how to manipulate donors and play one against one another. They know donors' own dynamics, namely that they have to spend a certain amount of money to meet their annual spending targets. 14. Check and balance institutions will be as effective as the GoB wants them to be. As donors continued to support institutions, GoB has shown strong resistance to revising essential laws, including in tax, police and parliament. In addition, successive governments have tampered Acts regulating the mandate of key institutions and with it, continue to interfere and curtail their independence.	Lessons from civil society 9.

Rice around the world 111 Recent developments in the rice sector Myanmar has a predominantly agricultural economy based on rice production .	Rice around the world 111 Recent developments in the rice sector Myanmar has a predominantly agricultural economy based on rice production. The agricultural sector, including livestock and fisheries, accounts for 53% of the country's GDP. Rice is the single most important crop, grown on 6.0 million ha or about two-thirds of the country's total cultivated area. Rice production employs 40% of the total labor force and consumes 70% of total commercial fertilizers. Rice maintains its position as the main staple food crop, accounting for 97% of total food grain production. The importance of rice as a major foreign exchange earner, however, has declined over time. Before World War II, Myanmar was the largest riceexporting country in the world. However, because of stagnation of production since the early 1960s, Thailand took the place of Myanmar in the export market, as exports declined from 1.7 million t in 1962 to 0.3 million t in 1975. Annual exports had fluctuated from 0.5 to 0.9 million t during 1976- 86, a period of respectable growth in rice production. Exports in recent years have fallen below 100,000 t. Myanmar has the capacity to substantially increase rice exports, but it is constrained by poor grain quality, inadequate processing and marketing infrastructure, and an underdeveloped trading system.

Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic , social and political spheres .	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.	Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres.

The early decision to work across the full value chain of the crop was visionary, since the program is already addressing the new USAID Peanut CRSP External Evaluation Report 2005 - 31 - strategic plan. One of the lessons learned from the past program was to match projects addressing production with projects creating demand. The extensive list of achievements and benefits to both the U.S.A. and the host countries is an indication of the quality and commitment of scientists participating in the program. Technology transfer has been achieved through partnerships with multiple stakeholders. The Peanut CRSP has been very successful in expanding its budget, and in leveraging funds from other sources. However, progress in a number of projects has been limited by the amount of funds allocated.

Two studies were conducted in the United States , one of which reported on state-based credentialing of CHWs occurring in four states ( 68 ) , while the other summarized certification experience from New York City ( 97 ) .	"To reduce CHW drop-out rates and to ensure a sense of commitment to service, an earlier review suggested that CHW programmes should set up clear appointment and deployment strategies for CHWs who pass the final exam at the end of a training and receive a certificate of course completion (13). However, there is little formal evidence that suggests that certification improves outcomes. In this section, the guideline explores the evidence and provides policy guidance on competency-based, formal certification for CHWs who have successfully completed pre-service training. 7.5.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that the very limited evidence points to a positive, though largely untested, potential of formal credentialing of CHWs. While credentialing may in theory negatively impact equity (by limiting the number of CHWs authorized to practise to those awarded a formal licence, thereby restricting access to services), in many contexts it can be a pathway to greater competency of CHWs (and hence improved patient safety through better quality of care). Further, it can enhance credibility, recognition and employability of CHWs. On this basis, the GDG supported a conditional recommendation in favour of formal certification. 7.5.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.5) addressing the question - ""For community health workers who have received pre-service training, should competency-based formal certification be used versus not?"" (96) - identified four eligible qualitative studies that reported on how certification processes were perceived by small, non-representative samples of CHWs. Two studies were conducted in the United States, one of which reported on state-based credentialing of CHWs occurring in four states (68), while the other summarized certification experience from New York City (97). A national view on certification was also included in a study from the Islamic Republic of Iran, where certification is the norm and is required to achieve employment as a CHW (75). In a fourth study, from Ethiopia, certification was one among many topics discussed with interviewees who represented a scoped community mobilization project (98)."

A package of improved agronomic practices has been developed by ANAPO researchers to introduce to farmers whose practices are very traditional .	Breeding and Variety Selection: One peanut variety was released by ANAPO in 2004. A good range of germplasm has been developed through crossing, both in the U.S. and Bolivia, and some derivatives show considerable potential for resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), leaf spot diseases, and Aspergillus flavus (producer of aflatoxin) fungal invasion. ANAPO released a new variety (Mairana, a white-seeded variety) in 2004, a selection from the earlier introduced U.S. genotypes. It is now under seed production by ANAPO for wider distribution in peanut growing areas in the Mairana valley and other zones. Three potential lines (Accession 32, 72, and 75) are being tested in advanced trials in three zones (in Mairana, 26 Agustos, and Saavedra). A new variety from these three lines could be released in Bolivia in 2005. Some ANAPO promising lines (including genotypes from U.S.) are being tested by the Promocion de Investigacion de Productos Andianos (PROINPA) for adaptability for the altiplano (mountain zone). Crosses with local wild peanut species is also planned. Programa Investigaciones de Mani (PIROMANI), a private institution that maintains a peanut germplasm bank, including wild relatives, in Cochabamba has given access to its collection to ANAPO's breeders through a formal agreement. ANAPO has also received germplasm from Argentina and Brazil that is included in the ongoing trials. Production, harvesting, and processing technologies. A package of improved agronomic practices has been developed by ANAPO researchers to introduce to farmers whose practices are very traditional. These include: (1) planting density (rows closer together and more plants per meter of row); (2) one pre-emergence and one post-emergence herbicide spraying based on intensity and weed species; (3) one or two fungicide sprayings based on disease and intensity of inoculum; and (4) zero tillage technology for sustainable peanut production.

The project aims to bridge the current digital gap. It also addresses the unavailability of good internet access, expensive commercial software packages, and the inability to pay for accessing learning content. We are looking for partners who can take the tutorials to different countries and cater to the needs of IT literacy and health training. Government agencies, private agencies, individuals and organisations working in this domain can also partner with us. Using Spoken Tutorials, we have trained 5 million students during past six years. Since August 2018, we went for paid model for online tests and certificates. More than 1,000 colleges have participated in it, simultaneously with the completion rate going up three fold. During the COVID-19 lock down, page views of our portal have gone up dramatically, with about 250,000 page views a day currently. Naturally, our Alexa rank is improving: from about 225,000 three months ago to about 80,000 now, dropping by about 4,000 every day. Our India rank is 4,000, dropping by about 400 every day. Coincidentally, our Spoken Tutorial courses also got included in the SWAYAM portal about a month ago, with an AICTE tag. This project is replicable in any country of the world. We already have the audio-video tutorials. These tutorials are ready of adoption by translating them into the local language of the country. The tutorials are made in such a way that the graphics remain the same and only the audio can be translated. The project has signed a MoU will Afghanistan where these tutorials will be used for IT literacy after translating them.	The project aims to bridge the current digital gap.

In Bangladesh, Bangla language is our mother tongue so Bangla gets priority in our country. The language movement was the foundation of Bangladesh's independence. It is said that Bangladeshis are very much emotional about language. So the nation has given priority to Bangla ignoring English. But English should not be ignored as it is needed to survive in this competitive world. Nowadays, many students do not get job after obtaining their university degree. The main reason behind this is they are very weak in English. From primary level to university, students study in Bangla medium. They face the brutal reality when they face job interviews. It is often very tough to get job without knowing English in this competitive job market. For this reason, most of the parents are worried about their children future. So now-adays they give extra attention to their child's English learning. But English teaching quality is not very standard at primary level Bangla medium schools. So in this case, parents seek efficient private tutors for their child's purpose. In this way, most of the young learners involved with private tutoring.

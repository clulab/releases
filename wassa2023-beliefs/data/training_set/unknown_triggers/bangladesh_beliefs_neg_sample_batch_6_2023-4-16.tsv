Continual intervention is needed because the ecosystem has been created or at least substantially modified by management .	Distinguishing features Category IV protected areas usually help to protect, or restore: 1) flora species of international, national or local importance; 2) fauna species of international, national or local importance including resident or migratory fauna; and/or 3) habitats. The size of the area varies but can often be relatively small; this is however not a distinguishing feature. Management will differ depending on need. Protection may be sufficient to maintain particular habitats and/or species. However, as category IV protected areas often include fragments of an ecosystem, these areas may not be self-sustaining and will require regular and active management interventions to ensure the survival of specific habitats and/or to meet the requirements of particular species. A number of approaches are suitable: * Protection of particular species: to protect particular target species, which will usually be under threat (e.g., one of the last remaining populations); * Protection of habitats: to maintain or restore habitats, which will often be fragments of ecosystems; * Active management to maintain target species: to maintain viable populations of particular species, which might include for example artificial habitat creation or maintenance (such as artificial reef creation), supplementary feeding or other active management systems; * Active management of natural or semi-natural ecosystems: to maintain natural or semi-natural habitats that are either too small or too profoundly altered to be self-sustaining, e.g., if natural herbivores are absent they may need to be replaced by livestock or manual cutting; or if hydrology has been altered this may necessitate artificial drainage or irrigation; * Active management of culturally-defined ecosystems: to maintain cultural management systems where these have a unique associated biodiversity. Continual intervention is needed because the ecosystem has been created or at least substantially modified by management. The primary aim of management is maintenance of associated biodiversity.

"Learning disparities begin in early grades and remain throughout primary education. There is a very strong correlation between the rural/urban parity index for learning in early grades (grade 2 or 3) and at the end of primary education (grade 6).b In other words, countries with huge disparities in early grades are rarely able to make up their lost ground later on. a. While some studies demonstrate that learning mathematics does not necessarily require reading skills, a vast majority of research findings show that reading is key to learning mathematics (G. Fite, ""Reading and Math: What Is the Connection?""; H. Korpershoek, H. Kuyper, and G. Van Der Werf, ""The relation between students' math and reading ability and their mathematics, physics, and chemistry examination grades in secondary education""). b. R2=0.87; GPE compilation based on data of the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (database), Montreal, http://www.uis.unesco.org (most recent data points available between 2005 and 2015, grade 6). comes. Across the 10 countries with PASEC data, 45 percent of the schools were underperforming with fewer than 20 percent of their students achieving minimum proficiency level, while in other schools the majority of students achieved minimum proficiency levels (see Appendix F). The degree of variance between schools differs across countries. For example, in Chad and Niger more than 80 percent of schools are underperforming, while this figure is only 1 percent in Burundi. The vast majority (88.7 percent) of the underperforming schools are located in rural areas, and a majority (53.1 percent) of the students in these underperforming schools come from the poorest 40 percent households."

It is done in the form of homework and learning what was asked by the schoolteachers .	Private tutoring is defined as fee-based tutoring that provides supplementary instruction to children in academic subjects they study in the mainstream education system (Dang & Rogers, 2008, p.161). Educational institutions are the places where tuition is supposed to take place. The teachers and the students jointly participate in classroom situation to achieve education. The education provision is such that in majority cases the students require study at home in order to supplement school education. It is done in the form of homework and learning what was asked by the schoolteachers. Studying at home requires tutoring support, which sometimes the parents, relatives or the household members provide and sometimes do not, so, an external support is often sought for this and such support is sometimes provided free of cost and often on a payment basis. Therefore, private tutoring means payment-based tutoring support to the students outside official school hour (Nath, 2006, p.1).

They are most common in the graphs showing indices of production , area , and yield because some countries expanded production and area harvested very rapidly in percentage terms ( often from a very low base ) during the past 35 years .	There are exceptions to this scale consistency, however. They are most common in the graphs showing indices of production, area, and yield because some countries expanded production and area harvested very rapidly in percentage terms (often from a very low base) during the past 35 years. Given such extraordinary rapid growth, the use of a common scale for all countries would nearly obliterate the time trends of many countries, including most if not all of the world's major rice producers. Thus, a decision was made to use different scales for certain countries on some graphs. When the scale is not identical across all countries, a note to that effect is included for the countries with different scales. In addition to different scales for indices of production, area harvested, and yield per hectare, several countries also have different scales for per capita production (Cambodia, Guyana, Suriname).

Obviously, a country does not need to be self-sufficient in domestic food production to achieve or sustain food security. Singapore and Hong Kong (China) produce very little food but have better records of food security than the major rice-growing countries in the region. Malaysia meets almost one-quarter of its rice needs through imports. It is a prudent policy because Malaysia maintains domestic production with subsidies; resources tied up in rice cultivation can be used more productively in alternative economic activities. What is important for food security is achieving food self-reliance. This requires (1) a favorable export growth at the national level, permitting food-deficit countries to import food from food-surplus countries that can produce it at a lower cost; and (2) at the household level, developing productive employment that enables the population to buy adequate food. Most countries in East and Rice around the world 67 Southeast Asia are fortunate in this respect. With growing economic prosperity and alleviation of poverty, they are able to fulfill these conditions. In fact, as the cost of rice production increases with growing wage rates, land prices, and scarcity of water, it makes sense to readjust resources away from labor-intensive rice cultivation, if improving economic efficiency is the primary consideration.

Similarly , despite improvement , poor environmental sustainability remains a challenge that threatens the subregion 's natural assets .	Subregion Analysis Though the North and Central America subregion is more competitive than the South America subregion, it did experience minimal TTCI score improvement from 2017 to 2019. The subregion accounts for most of the parent region's T&T industry, including high international arrivals and departures, thanks to the larger economies of Mexico, Canada and, especially, the United States. Overall, the subregion scores higher than both the South America and global averages on international openness, T&T prioritization, air transport and tourist service infrastructure--but lower on safety, health, ICT readiness and cultural resource indicators. In particular, improvement on indicators in the T&T Prioritization and Enabling subindex pillars have been the primary drivers of the subregion's enhanced competitiveness. This includes slightly greater international openness, the subregion's most significant advantage relative to the global average, and far greater price competitiveness, an area where many of its countries trail. The subregion also improved safety and security performance, the area with the largest gap compared to global averages. North and Central America's greatest advantage over South America is its more developed infrastructure, especially air and ground transport infrastructure. Yet the region lags behind global competitors on the latter category.

He ended up taking on a far bigger problem: the shortage of water in India, a drought-plagued country with 17 percent of the world's population but just 4 percent of its freshwater resources. It's a crusade that has earned him the moniker ""Waterman of India."" In 1983, Singh quit an unrewarding civil service job to take advantage of his training in Ayurveda, an Indian system of medicine based on herbal remedies. He moved from Jaipur, the capital of the northern state of Rajasthan, to Gopalpura, a small village where a number of people suffered from night blindness, a condition in developing countries caused by vitamin A deficiency. ""I wanted to set up an Ayurvedic clinic to help cure them,"" Singh says. ""While I did do that as well, the people in the village underscored the fact that their immediate crisis was one of water."" One of Singh's patients told him about johads, traditional reservoirs made of rocks and earth. Singh, the son of a farmer, quickly understood the need for the reservoirs, which capture rainwater and so help prevent a decline in the water table. He enlisted the help of several friends and a few villagers to build the first johad, in 1985. ""There weren't many people as most had migrated to the city as a result of water scarcity in the village,"" Singh, 63, explains. ""Most often it was the women in the village who helped."" He persuaded villagers to overcome caste divisions and work together. ""That was the only way water would become a collective and community project,"" he says. It took more than eight months Rajendra Singh (center) confers with villagers in Bhupkera, Rajasthan."	Rajendra Singh set out to cure the sick.

The National Strategy for Watershed Management addresses the need to foster agriculture that is both sustainable and resilient to climate change through FLR activities , such as reforestation , improved irrigation and soil management practices in aquifer recharge zones and dry regions .	The policies and strategies under MAG include (1) the Institutional Strategic Plan, aimed at promoting the restoration of priority ecosystems, riparian areas and forests and enhancing sustainable agriculture to create integrated biological corridors, and (2) the National Forestry Policy, which has as its primary objective the sustainable management of water and soil resources. FLR activities linked to good agricultural practices and afforestation/reforestation activities are supported by Second Bonn Challenge progress report MAG to improve the resilience of farming systems and achieve climate change mitigation under the National Forestry Policy. The National Strategy for Watershed Management addresses the need to foster agriculture that is both sustainable and resilient to climate change through FLR activities, such as reforestation, improved irrigation and soil management practices in aquifer recharge zones and dry regions. There is also the National Forestry Strategy, which enumerates a series of actions to restore ecosystems and increase forest cover. The strategy includes five activities that directly relate to FLR: (i) managing financial resources to implement forest restoration projects; (ii) establishing forestry incentives; (iii) promoting forest conservation; (iv) fostering agroforestry and commercial plantations; and (v) providing support to set up forest communities and non-profit associations that will implement reforestation and forest conservation. Finally, mag is responsible for the national policy on climate change for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture. The primary objective of this policy is to promote the sustainable management of natural resources through soil and water conservation practices that both improve local adaptive capacities and unlock the climate change mitigation potential of the land-use sector, giving priority to the most vulnerable populations. Fostering FLR activities, such as conservation agriculture and the management, instead of burning, of crop residues is part of what is proposed to achieve this objective.

Guidelines for applying protected area management categories Protected areas Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation. They are the cornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation strategies, set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or endemic species from becoming extinct. They are complementary to measures to achieve conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity outside protected areas in accordance with CBD guidelines such as the Malawi and Addis Ababa Principles (CBD VII/11-12). Most protected areas exist in natural or near-natural ecosystems, or are being restored to such a state, although there are exceptions.

T he Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of diseases, ideas, food crops, and populations between the New World and the Old World following the voyage to the Americas by Christo pher Columbus in 1492. The Old World--by which we mean not just Europe, but the entire Eastern Hemisphere--gained from the Columbian Exchange in a number of ways. Discoveries of new supplies of metals are perhaps the best known. But the Old World also gained new staple crops, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava. Less calorie-intensive foods, such as tomatoes, chili peppers, cacao, peanuts, and pineapples were also introduced, and are now culinary centerpieces in many Old World countries, namely Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries (tomatoes), India and Korea (chili peppers), Hungary (paprika, made from chili peppers), and Malaysia and Thailand (chili peppers, peanuts, and pineapples). Tobacco, another New World crop, was so universally adopted that it came to be used as a substitute for currency in many parts of the world. The exchange also drastically increased the availability of many Old World crops, such as sugar and coffee, which were particularly well-suited for the soils of the New World. The exchange not only brought gains, but also losses. European contact enabled the transmission of diseases to previously isolated communities, which .

Access to finance is a constraint , as indicated by the relatively low levels of capital intensity and high rate of returns to capital in Ivorian firms .	Comparisons of firm dynamics patterns and business climate with a set of comparator countries lead to a range of potential policy actions. Access to finance is a constraint, as indicated by the relatively low levels of capital intensity and high rate of returns to capital in Ivorian firms. Within Coted'Ivoire's formal sector, there seems to be substantial heterogeneity in capital constraints across sectors and firm size. In contrast to conventional wisdom, smaller firms are not necessarily more capital constrained. At the institutional level, Coted'Ivoire still has margin for improvements in its access to finance regulations, due to a lack of a credit registry or credit information sharing, and a movable collateral registry. Doing Business reforms in these areas could reduce the overall cost of lending and improve access to finance especially for smaller and less-established firms. In addition, for the small and medium firms in particular, combating corruption and lack of competition in the transport sector, will help improve their access to regional markets. Indeed, in the short run, growth in output demand is most likely to come from tradable sectors, but high transportation costs due to outdated infrastructure and inefficient logistics are limiting Ivorian firms' ability to reach regional and global markets.

Some migration journeys are highly gendered , such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry , or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity .	Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration. Some migration journeys are highly gendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity. Many other migrations, the majority, include both boys and girls, though sometimes in different ratios, depending on country of origin. Much child migration, particularly outside the context of conflict or disaster, is safe and undertaken as part of a family unit. However, there is an increasing tendency for children to be involved in migration that jeopardizes their safety and violates their rights. Examples of this type of migration include not only the obviously life-threatening forced migrations across treacherous routes - such as the Eastern and Central Mediterranean, where drownings are frequent - but also migrations where children are routinely exposed to physical and/or sexual violence. Unsafe migration also includes situations where children rely on exploitative intermediaries who take advantage of the need for migration assistance to extract labour or other types of services from children in their custody. The discussion focuses on these aspects of child migration.

In West Africa, O. glaberrima is a dominant crop grown in the flooded areas of the Niger and Sokoto River basins. It is broadcast on hoed fields. On shallowly flooded land, a rainfed wetland crop is either directly sown by broadcasting or dibbling, or transplanted. About 45% of the land planted to rice in Africa belongs to the upland (dryland) culture, largely under bush fallow or after the ground has been hoed. Some African farmers still use axes, hoes, and bush knives in land preparation. In hydromorphic soils, O. glaberrima behaves like a selfperpetuating weed.

Universal health coverage, which refers to systems in which all people have access to adequate health care without financial hardship and in an equitable manner, has been instituted in only some developed countries.2 Its prioritization in developing regions is likely to be based on each country's epidemiological conditions, demographics, economic resources and current state of the health system.3 Biology determines the health needs and vulnerabilities specific to women and men. It is one of the main factors behind men's increased risk for a number of health problems, their higher mortality (starting from day one and extending throughout their lives), and their shorter life expectancy. However, medical and technological improvements over several decades are extending the lives of both men and women.

Attitudes refer to the sets of beliefs that the learner holds towards members of the target group and also towards his own culture (Brown, 2000). Language attitude is an important concept because it plays a key role in language learning. In education, attitudes are considered both as input and output. Motivation is the most used concept for explaining failure or success of a learner. Also motivation has been regarded as one of the main factors that influence the speed and amount of success of foreign language learners. (Gardener, 2006).

Reduced FDI from France over 2006-2008, English-speaking countries hold low share France is the main single source of foreign investment in Cameroon. However, FDI inflow from France declined to only US$53 million in 2008, down from just over US$113 million in 2006. FDI from the US also fell from US$33 million in 2005 to just US$4 million in 2008 in fixed exchange rate terms, according to the OECD. The main reason behind the decline in overall FDI from 2006 onwards is high commodity prices on items such as coffee and palm oil as well as the global economic downturn. Other leading investors in Cameroon include Germany, Belgium and China, with the gas and oil industry attracting the most investment. The FDI of English-speaking countries represented less than 2% of total FDI in Cameroon in 2008. This has a dampening effect on the development of English in Cameroon, particularly when compared with high levels of French FDI. Nevertheless, this has not diminished the importance placed on the English language by ambitious individuals or the government. 375 264 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow (2005-2009) - US$ million English language quantitative indicators !

This is broadly understood within the business community - however, rising tensions between French-and English-speaking territories in Cameroon may hinder this. Research shows that Cameroon is continuing its investment in education, as this is seen as fundamental to FDI. According to company interviews, the banking, services, technology, mining and quarrying industries are the leading industries that are in need for English speakers. Euromonitor's research also indicates a correlation between industry productivity and the percentage of English speakers.

These nurse specialists are categorized by education , training , and competence .	Nurse Types and Titles The Middle East uses common nurse types such as RNs, practical nurses, and midwives; however, some nurse types and categories are very detailed (Tables C35 through C38). For example, Israel recognizes a particularly specialized nurse--the academic registered lactation consultant. There are two types of registered nurses, RNs and technique superior registered nurses, in Lebanon. The four types of nurse specialists in Saudi Arabia are General Specialists 1 and 2 and First Specialists 1 and 2. These nurse specialists are categorized by education, training, and competence. For instance, Nurse Specialist 1 requires successful completion of a bachelor's degree program in a specialty for entry into the Nurse Specialist 1 program, whereas a master's degree or equivalent in a specialty is required for entry into a Nurse Specialist 2 program. Furthermore, 2 years of post-master's degree experience in nursing is required for First Specialist 1 program entry, and 3 years of post-master's degree experience in nursing is required for First Nurse Specialist 2 program entry. Georgia has two types of general nurse, a Type 1 practice nurse and a Type 2 practice nurse. The Type 1 practice nurse requires completion of secondary education before program entrance, whereas and Type 2 practice nurse requires passage of the National Entrance Examination. Oman requires the demonstration of English language proficiency including admission interviews held in both Arabic and English languages for psychiatric nurses, infectious disease nurses, and pediatric nurses. Most Middle Eastern jurisdictions also recognize a general midwife and some form of nurse assistant. In Bahrain, Iran, Israel, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates, a nursing assistant is also called a Practical Nurse. Jordan has suspended its practical nursing program from new applicants.

Across survey years and labor input variables (family and hired), rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective. Cotton and cashew producers make the most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Finally, consistent with findings from other countries (for example, Damiani (2003) for Brazil), vegetable production is also highly labor intensive. Its potential has so far been largely left unexploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but much scope for improvement remains.

For instance, PASEC schools with the greatest allocation of pedagogical resources are not necessarily those with the highest levels of achievement in reading.

Wechtler, ""The Effectiveness of Inputs in Primary Education""; H.-A. Dang, L. Sarr and N. Asadullah, ""School Access, Resources, and Learning Outcomes: Evidence from a Non-formal School Program in Bangladesh""). b. Given a selected set of input and output variables, DEA estimates a frontier of best practices. It is a relative measure. The most efficient schools are on the frontier and the efficiency of the other schools is evaluated by measuring the distance to this empirical frontier, and a score between 0 and 1 is given to each school. The higher the efficiency score, the closest is the distance to the frontier and the more efficient is the school. A total of six inputs and two outputs have been included in the analysis. c. The DEA results show that returns to scale are increasing in these schools. An increase in the school resources would lead to a higher than proportional increase in learning outcomes. 21. Results for Lesotho and Tanzania are linked to their participation in the regional assessment program Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), which has not had a round of evaluations recently.

Recent initiatives and policy processes include regional dialogues on migration in Africa , the Americas , and Central and South-East Asia ; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 ; the Paris Agreement ; and the World Humanitarian Summit .	The situations of people who have moved from their countries of origin only to find themselves caught in a crisis that threatens their security and ability to thrive are of growing concern to the international community. While crises affect both nationals and non-nationals, the ability of migrants to cope with their impacts may be reduced, due to conditions of vulnerability associated with migrants' legal, economic and social status, as well as practical challenges, such as linguistic differences, geographic displacement and even cultural context, which can limit access to timely and understandable information, services, resources and safety. While not all migrants are equally affected in times of crisis, they are often among the most vulnerable, at increased risk and in need of specific support.2 Addressing the needs of migrants living in places affected by crisis has become a priority of policy forums at both global and regional levels. Recent initiatives and policy processes include regional dialogues on migration in Africa, the Americas, and Central and South-East Asia; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030; the Paris Agreement; and the World Humanitarian Summit. The Migrants in Countries in Crisis (MICIC) Initiative and the development of the set of Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster3 provide concrete examples of efforts to improve current practice.4 The situation of migrants in crisis contexts is also acknowledged in the 2018 Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, where it is highlighted as an essential element for the achievement of objective 2 on minimizing the drivers of forced migration, and objective 7 on reducing migrants' vulnerability.

Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries. Rates of new firm registration are low in most countries in the region.83 And even when they do get started, small firms face barriers in growing into sizable companies. The vast majority of Tunisian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them are one-person entities, and only 0.4 percent have 100 workers or more. But these large firms account for more than one-third of all jobs, more than all the one-person firms combined. A study of their dynamics over a decade shows that micro-and small firms hardly ever become large firms. Moreover, one-person firms only very rarely graduate into the small size category, and many are likely to shut down.84 While countries with high youth unemployment may face a large youth bulge or education quality issues, problems are often on the demand side, with limited competition reducing employment opportunities, especially for highly skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased. This prospect is unlikely to materialize, however, as long as political connections remain more important than entrepreneurial capacity to enter they would make a major dent in the aggregate unemployment rate is unclear. Better matches between jobseekers and employment opportunities would result in large increases in total employment only if there were many unfilled vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle East and North Africa. Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and by increasing privatization and deregulation.79 Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for the most part.80 The problem is similar with training programs. Educated youth have the capacity to learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could even provide on-the-job training as needed. But training may not change aspirations.

A higher score on the Corruption Perceptions Index indicates a lower level of perceived corruption. 6. Economies are selected on the basis of the number of reforms and ranked on how much their ease of doing business score improved. First, Doing Business selects the economies that implemented reforms making it easier to do business in 3 or more of the 10 areas included in this year's aggregate ease of doing business score. Regulatory changes making it more difficult to do business are subtracted from the number of those making it easier. Second, Doing Business ranks these economies on the increase in their ease of doing business score due to reforms from the previous year (the impact due to changes in income per capita and the lending rate is excluded). The improvement in their score is calculated not by using the data published in 2018 but by using comparable data that capture data revisions and methodology changes when applicable. The choice of the most improved economies is determined by the largest improvements in the ease of doing business score among those with at least three reforms. The order of economies is based on the difference of unrounded scores. 7. Considering the areas that constitute the ease of doing business ranking. 8. Ramalho and Saltane 2019. 9.

Female enrollment in primary education is particularly low in Coted'Ivoire. Enrollment in primary education lags other Sub-Saharan African developing countries, and the problem appears most acute among females (Figures 6.2a and 6.2b). Before the conflict that began in 2002 enrollment of females in primary school in Coted'Ivoire stood about 15 percentage points below the regional average at 65 percent compared to 80 percent, while enrollment of males was closer at 88 percent compared to 93 percent. Both the enrollment of boys and girls was detrimentally affected by the conflict and crises. However, by 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, male enrollment had recovered to 96 percent compared to a regional average of 103 percent, while female enrollment stood at 84 percent, still more than 10 percentage points below the regional average of 96 percent. As such, inequality in access to education is particularly marked among women. This analysis can be complemented with other Coted'Ivoire specific sources of information on GERs, such as the 2012 Demographic Health Survey and the 2013 Employment Survey (ENSETE 2013). While these show higher aggregate GERs of 95.7 percent and 100.8 percent, respectively, they also uncover gender gaps with the male/ female rates being 101.9 percent / 89.3 percent and 107.3 percent / 94.3 percent, respectively.

According to UIS and World Bank data, the overall volume of public expenditure on education increased in DCPs by 1.58 percent on average annually from 2015 to 2017,8 amounting to an additional US$2.1 billion. Despite the school-age population growth (1.09 percent on average annually), the average public expenditure per school-age child increased by 0.5 percentage point during the same period. The public education spending per child is US$100 on average in DCPs, but it can vary significantly across countries, from US$13 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (a low-income country) to US$380 in Albania (a middle-income country).9 6.

After the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, recovery funds allocated to the education sector were proportionally less than others: Education was allocated an estimated US$397 million (6 percent of the total recovery need), whereas the housing sector, for example, received an estimated US$3,278 million (49 percent of the total need), according to the 2015 Post Disaster Need Assessment. This caused a declining ratio of education spending to total public spending, from 20.1 percent in 2015 (fiscal year 2017) down to 17 percent in 2017 (fiscal year 2019), while the dollar amount for education increased. 8.

Fourth , global demand for Coted'Ivoire 's agricultural export commodities points to continuing opportunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture .	Fourth, global demand for Coted'Ivoire's agricultural export commodities points to continuing opportunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. The extent to which Engel's Law acts as a constraint on the demand for a country's agricultural products (and labor), depends also on the tradability of its agriculture, the evolution of global (as opposed to domestic) demand, and the country's comparative advantage. The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity, the less constrained the country is by domestic demand and the larger is its agriculture's potential for generating jobs. The production and export of cash crops, especially cocoa, but also of coffee, cotton, and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Coted'Ivoire's economy and job creation. They also feed other sectors of the economy, particularly agro-processing, commerce, and transportation and contribute importantly to formal wage job creation, many of them low skilled (Chapter5).

Ecuador remained on the Special 301 Watch List in 2018. Enforcement of intellectual property (IP) against widespread counterfeiting and piracy remains weak. With respect to the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical industries, Ecuador does not appear to adequately protect against the unfair commercial use or the unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products. On August 22, 2016, Ecuador issued a Presidential Decree 1159 to amend Presidential Decree 522, which affects the labeling of off-patent medicines. Stakeholders were concerned that Presidential Decree 1159 might prejudice the legitimate interests of affected trademark holders and added an additional labeling requirement to batches sent to Ecuador. Decrees 1159 and 522 were repealed on May 4, 2018, by Presidential Decree 385, resolving the labelling issue.

The Police Act of 1861 governs policy administration with operational aspects guided by the Policy Regulation of Bengal 1943 .	The main law enforcement agency is the police under the Ministry of Home Affairs with 539 police regions or 'thanas' across the country. The Police Act of 1861 governs policy administration with operational aspects guided by the Policy Regulation of Bengal 1943. Other enforcement agencies include the Chaukidars and Dafadars (village police), Ansars and Village Defence Party, Bangladesh Rifles (paramilitary force charged with border protection and prevention of smuggling) and the Rapid Action Battalion (charged with crime control, confiscation of illegal arms, trafficking, money laundering, etc.). Both TIB surveys and a BBC Survey in 2005 confirmed that Bangladeshis have very little trust in the police. The major problems for the police include the role that politics plays in the transfer and posting of police officers. Working conditions are quite poor, and training and career opportunities reserved for senior level officers police do not attract sufficiently skilled and motivated staff. There is no support system for police and their families, housing and medical facilities for lower ranks are poor and welfare benefits in the case of accidents or death are not distributed in a timely manner.

The second of these resilience assessment components identifies contextual drivers of resilience .	"The second of these resilience assessment components identifies contextual drivers of resilience. These are the underlying social, institutional, and economic factors that generate feedbacks determining the distribution of proximal factors and the observed heterogeneity in resilience. The vulnerability literature emphasizes the importance of contextual factors in determining the differential impacts of natural hazards, most notably referred to as ""root causes"" within the pressure and release model (Wisner et al. 2004). Within a resilience framing, contextual drivers of resilience interact with proximal factors, as well as contemporary characteristics of the farming system generating feedbacks that create path-dependency in the trajectory of farm resilience. This is exemplified by Enfors (2013) and Enfors and Gordon (2008) who use evidence from drought prone catchments in Tanzania to show that institutional change, drought, and population growth reinforce a cycle of ecosystem degradation, low crop yields, and poverty. They argue that destabilization of these feedbacks is necessary for alternative development trajectories to take place. Awareness of ultimate contextual, social, and institutional factors is important for realizing sustained impact from social protection interventions; this is encapsulated in the concept of transformative social protection (Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux 2011). Bene et al. (2012) draws upon this to argue that awareness of these same factors are important for building resilience to shocks (among certain groups). Inclusive and effective institutions, social capital, and equity have been reported as key characteristics of climate resilient systems (Bahadur et al. 2013)."

Carry out educational system reforms , with a view to promote inclusive education and to ensure equal learning opportunities .	There is an urgent need to improve access to education for persons with disabilities because educational disadvantage could lead to higher rates of social exclusion and poverty and therefore have long-term implications for their capacity to participate in the labour force. The disability education gap could undermine the achievement of Goal 4 as well as other SDGs. To achieve Goal 4 for persons with disabilities, in line with the CRPD, more political commitment and efforts are needed, particularly in implementing and scaling up the following actions: 1) Strengthen national policies and the legal system to ensure access to quality education for all persons with disabilities. Ensure that national legal and policy frameworks reflect the rights of persons with disabilities to education and eliminate discriminatory policies and laws. Promote the enrolment of persons with disabilities into mainstream education. Carry out educational system reforms, with a view to promote inclusive education and to ensure equal learning opportunities. This would also help prevent risks of segregation and contribute to ensuring a truly inclusive learning environment for all. 2) Build the capacity of policymakers as well other decision makers at both the community and national levels to enhance their knowledge of the educational needs of persons with disabilities and to identify and implement strategies on inclusive education. 3) Make schools and educational facilities accessible by creating an enabling environment for students with disabilities and by making physical and virtual environments accessible. It is essential that students with disabilities can access all school buildings and other educational and recreational facilities, including classrooms, common rooms, libraries, dining areas, toilets and playgrounds. Universal Design, a set of principles that can be applied in the construction or refurbishment of buildings, should be used as a guide for improving school accessibility as well as analysing the current situation in schools.

Enhancing productivity and sustainability of favorable environments The major factor in poverty alleviation in recent years has been the reduction in the unit cost of production and the downward trend in real prices of food. Improved technologies were adopted fastest in the favorable irrigated environment, which accounts for nearly 45% of the rice land and more than 70% of total rice production. Because of its importance, we must continue to focus on this favorable environment as the major source of rice supply to meet the growing demand from the expanding urban population and the rural landless. The challenges are how to sustain the high yields already achieved in this ecosystem and whether modern science can be used to explore possibilities of a further shiftin yield potential. The options for extending the area under high-yielding modern rice varieties by developing irrigation infrastructure will no longer be available for many countries because of the looming water crisis. Farmers need assistance from rice scientists on how to grow rice with less water and how to operate irrigation systems more efficiently. Technological options must be developed to maintain soil fertility and control pest pressure.

Juvenile detention facilities remained overcrowded and detainees suffered inhuman and degrading conditions. In Ceara state, torture by state officials was recurrent inside juvenile detention facilities. During the year, there were at least 20 riots and 37 escapes from units in Ceara. Out of 200 formal reports of torture of adolescents inside juvenile detention units in Ceara between 2016 and September 2017, only two reports resulted in a formal inquiry by the state for further investigation. Reports of the chaotic state of the juvenile justice system in Ceara resulted in a formal visit by Brazil's National Human Rights Council in September. Early in the year, Espirito Santo state held 1,198 juvenile detainees in a system with capacity for only 754, a rate of overcrowding of more than 39%. Of the state's 13 detention facilities, only four were operating within their intended capacity. On 3 June, seven boys aged between 15 and 17 were killed by other teenage detainees during a riot in a juvenile detention facility in Lagoa Seca, Paraiba state.

Linking the National Footprint Accounts with Ecosystem Services The notion that the human economy is a subset of the surrounding ecology is integral to identifying the economic linkages between nature, human activities, and biodiversity. Various initiatives are currently underway to analyze the economic benefits of biodiversity and weigh the costs of effective policies against resulting deceleration of biodiversity loss. One of the more ambitious projects is the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which categorizes three types of ecosystem services: (1) provisioning (e.g. of food, fresh water, wood and fiber, fuel, etc.), (2) regulating (e.g. climate regulation, flood regulation, disease regulation, water purification, etc.), and (3) cultural (e.g. aesthetic, spiritual, educational, recreational, etc.) (MA 2005). In this context, the biocapacity and Ecological Footprint indicators focus on the biomass-based flows of the ecosystem's provisioning services and the waste uptake of its regulating services. Examples of the services quantified in the National Footprint Accounts include provisioning of food, fiber, and timber, and uptake of carbon dioxide by forests and oceans.

If agriculture matters most for poverty reduction , successful urbanization may hold the key to more rapid productivity and income growth as well as social cohesion .	The job structure in the cities is dominated by self-employment, with petty commerce growing quickly. If agriculture matters most for poverty reduction, successful urbanization may hold the key to more rapid productivity and income growth as well as social cohesion. In most of Sub-Saharan Africa, however, urbanization has failed to create the dynamism observed elsewhere in the developing world. Migration from rural to urban areas continues, but migrants are simply swelling the ranks of the self-employed earning subsistence wages. In the absence of dynamic cities, migration is driven by despair, and not hope. In Mozambique, for example, young people are moving to urban areas, but few are moving into regular wage employment. Meanwhile, levels of trust are falling and are lowest among young workers.16 Some have argued that the jobs challenge in these urban areas can be addressed through the creation of greater opportunities for selfemployment. For example, building space for informal markets around bus stops would allow more rural migrants to make a living. But selfemployment of this sort is unlikely to support the agglomeration effects and knowledge spillovers that make cities thrive elsewhere.

The policies and strategies under MAG include (1) the Institutional Strategic Plan, aimed at promoting the restoration of priority ecosystems, riparian areas and forests and enhancing sustainable agriculture to create integrated biological corridors, and (2) the National Forestry Policy, which has as its primary objective the sustainable management of water and soil resources. FLR activities linked to good agricultural practices and afforestation/reforestation activities are supported by Second Bonn Challenge progress report MAG to improve the resilience of farming systems and achieve climate change mitigation under the National Forestry Policy. The National Strategy for Watershed Management addresses the need to foster agriculture that is both sustainable and resilient to climate change through FLR activities, such as reforestation, improved irrigation and soil management practices in aquifer recharge zones and dry regions. There is also the National Forestry Strategy, which enumerates a series of actions to restore ecosystems and increase forest cover. The strategy includes five activities that directly relate to FLR: (i) managing financial resources to implement forest restoration projects; (ii) establishing forestry incentives; (iii) promoting forest conservation; (iv) fostering agroforestry and commercial plantations; and (v) providing support to set up forest communities and non-profit associations that will implement reforestation and forest conservation. Finally, mag is responsible for the national policy on climate change for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture. The primary objective of this policy is to promote the sustainable management of natural resources through soil and water conservation practices that both improve local adaptive capacities and unlock the climate change mitigation potential of the land-use sector, giving priority to the most vulnerable populations. Fostering FLR activities, such as conservation agriculture and the management, instead of burning, of crop residues is part of what is proposed to achieve this objective.

A quarter of a century ago, a renewed emphasis on poverty reduction as the key objective of development policy launched a long-term data effort. Across the world, information on household living standards was collected through standardized surveys, the sampling methods and the variable definitions used were duly documented, and the data and documentation were made available to researchers and practitioners whenever possible. A similar approach should be envisioned to move jobs center stage. only sporadically. Where labor statistics do exist, data quality is a concern throughout the statistical production chain, from the use of appropriate definitions to questionnaire design, from sampling frames to interviewing protocols, and from data entry and coding to verification and estimation procedures. Planning, coordination, and communication issues are exacerbated when different institutions are responsible for collecting and disseminating the data.119 The most urgent priorities are to standardize the employment modules attached to the household surveys used for poverty analysis, and to aq: no triple asterisks here like other chapters? Increased reliance on disaggregated survey data, together with rigorous program evaluation and controlled experiments, has pushed the knowledge frontier on jobs and development in recent years.

"Climate hazards affect agriculture through both short-and longterm adverse impacts on economic growth and human well-being (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Barrett and Santos 2014, Hsiang and Jina 2014). These impacts are heterogeneous; some groups, e.g. households, communities, or countries, face higher probabilities of exposure, some are better able to resist shocks, and some are better able to recover. At the same time, hazard impacts on agriculture can reinforce poverty traps, and heighten risk. In the absence of markets for insurance and credit, these impacts can lead farmers to choose low-return agricultural technologies to maintain stable livelihoods, often at levels below the poverty line (Carter et al. 2007, Dercon and Christiaensen 2011, Barrett et al. 2015). Repeated exposure to climate hazards can undermine current and future coping capacity (Bene et al. 2016a, Duncan et al. 2017).

"Today, that sense of wonder still permeates Glaeser's work as an urban economist. He deploys the economist's theoretical tool kit to explore questions inspired by his youth in New York. Why do some cities fail while others flourish? What accounts for sky-high housing costs in San Francisco? How does the growth of cities differ in rich and poor countries? ""I have always thought of myself as fundamentally a curious child,"" Glaeser, 52, says. Rather than ""pushing well-established literature forward,"" he seeks to comprehend ""something that I really don't understand when I start out."" While still a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Glaeser made his mark as a theorist of the benefits of agglomeration--the idea that dense and diverse cities are hothouses of innovation, energy, and creativity that fuel economic growth. In the years since, his work has ranged across a breathtaking variety of subjects, from rent control and real estate bubbles to property rights, civil disobedience, and carbon emissions. ""For a couple decades now, Ed has been the leading thinker about the economics of place,"" says Lawrence Summers, a Harvard professor who served as director of the National Economic Council under US President Barack Obama. ""And the economics of urban areas are increasingly being seen as central to broad economic concerns."" Glaeser and Summers are collaborating on a study of the hardening divide between welleducated, affluent coastal regions of the United States and islands of economic stagnation in what they call the ""eastern heartland,"" the interior states east of the Mississippi River. There, in cities like Flint, Michigan, the proportion of prime-age men who aren't working has been rising--along with rates of opioid addiction, disability, and mortality."

We provide training to students who are weak in English, so this will also result in the number of students familiar with English increasing."" English considered important to educational achievement English-medium schools are typically private schools that teach a state-set curriculum in English. The system is widespread in Pakistan, as all state universities require candidates to pass an in-house English language test. This underlines the importance of good English to a student's academic success. Levels of English are likely to improve over the next five years, following the government's decision to convert Urdu-medium schools to English. Every interviewee from educational institutions and companies said that demand for English language in the workplace will continue to rise, and this, coupled with government policy and individual ambition, will boost levels of fluency. The Pakistani Government is taking several steps to improve English teaching in the public education system: * In July 2010 the government appointed 50 English teachers to fringe parts of Islamabad such as Jaba Tall, Jaglot and Noorpur Shahan. This was accompanied by an increase in the fiscal budget allocated to education. * Efforts are being made to train teachers in English to ease the conversion of Urdu-medium schools to English. However, an article from Associated Press - 'Pakistan Sees Surge in Private Schools Over Failing Government System' - published in November 2009, noted that: ""Feudal structures in the rural areas [...] give landowners an incentive to keep farm workers uneducated and submissive."" This suggests that the improvement of rural education is likely to remain an uphill struggle. * At tertiary level, in a bid to improve the standard of English in public universities, the government launched Phase I of the English Language Teaching Reforms (ELTR) project in 2004. The ELTR has to date provided training to 1,540 teaching staff and updated teaching resources at 64 state-funded universities. Phase II of the ELTR project, launched in May 2010, aims to train another 1,400 teachers by 2013."	This underlines the importance of good English to a student's academic success.

When asked about their most preferred jobs , respondents in China , Colombia , Egypt , and Sierra Leone give different answers from those they offer when asked to identify the most important jobs to society ( figure 11 ) .	As jobs provide earnings, generate output, and influence identity, they shape the wellbeing of those who hold them--and they also affect the well-being of others. To understand how much jobs contribute to development, it is necessary to assess these effects--the spillovers from jobs. Jobs that generate positive spillovers have a greater value to society than they have to the individual who holds the job, while the opposite is true when spillovers are negative. Intuitively, many people have notions about such broader payoffs. When asked about their most preferred jobs, respondents in China, Colombia, Egypt, and Sierra Leone give different answers from those they offer when asked to identify the most important jobs to society (figure 11). Working as a civil servant or as a shop owner is generally preferred by individuals, while teachers and doctors are quite often mentioned as the most important jobs for society.

The index evolved in late 2010 and early 2011 out of discussions among US government agencies involved in the Feed the Future Initiative regarding the need for an indicator to monitor women's empowerment. The discussions initially revolved around using a gender perceptions index but eventually focused on an index similar to the multidimensional poverty indexes being developed by OPHI. Following the definition of 5DE in agriculture by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), work began at IFPRI in June-July 2011 to develop questionnaire modules that could be used to elicit responses on each of these domains. The full survey--with household and individual questionnaires, administered to a primary male and a primary female respondent in each household 4 --was piloted from September to November 2011 in Feed the Future zones of influence in Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda. Index development took place from November 2011 to January 2012. Qualitative interviews and case studies with individuals, as well as a technical consultation with outside experts in January 2012, provided further input into the choice of indicators that comprise the index. The WEAI itself was launched on February 28, 2012, at the 56th session of the Committee on the Status of Women at the United Nations, New York, and subsequently in three separate presentations in March in London, New Delhi, and Washington, DC.

While roasting , shelling and peanut butter making devices are available , they are undergoing continuous improvements , often with input from the locals .	Training and capacity building have been of major benefit to the HC. Technical staff at the Beacon Foundation have been trained in research methods and maintenance of equipment. Field trials, surveys and workshops were conducted in 2002 and 2003. Field trials and workshops were held in 5 villages in 2004. The better farmers are being trained as trainers to impart knowledge to their peers. There has been a rapid shiftin training emphasis as the production has expanded. Leveraging this project the Beacon Foundation has initiated training of women's groups to process these peanuts and add value. Five village factories have been established. The technologies being promoted for production, processing, roasting and making peanut butter are labor intensive and will absorb the available labor in the region. While roasting, shelling and peanut butter making devices are available, they are undergoing continuous improvements, often with input from the locals. Processing technologies for new products yet to be selected will need to be developed and fitted to local circumstances and the peanut CRSP will be on hand to offer help in those transitions.

They organized and led many of the workshops that we visited and were key players in generating questions and stimulating discussions. The demonstration exercise where we were introduced to the use of the shelling, roasting, de-skinning and peanut butter grinding technologies were run mainly by women. The making of the cassava bread which will also be sold in the school feeding program was demonstrated by women.

The second is to incorporate these new digital practices into the routine of health professionals. Awareness and training are being used to overcome this challenge. This project is organizationally and financially sustainable, since telehealth has already proved to be viable and an important instrument to complement face-to-face healthcare. Partnerships and financial support in the public and private sectors are viable alternatives, due to the scalability of the solution, and recognition of the cost-benefit ratio of digital practices. In addition, our institution is a recognized and solid public university in Brazil, with 73 years of commitment to society, the environment and the country's economy. Our technological strategy can be easily adopted and translate to other languages. However, Internet access must be available, teleconsulting specialist team is according to availability, ethical and regulatory aspects need to be considered, and telecommunications fee can be applied.

Principal Investigator's concept of addressing the objectives of the PUR10 project via singlemulti-center studies, a team concept has resulted with the three partnering institutions, Purdue University in U.S.A, the Food Technology Institute in Ghana, and Viscosa University in Brazil. In these Project PUR10U - 128 - countries, close relationships have been developed with consumers who participate in the studies as Subjects and benefit from the learning experience about their personal health relative to diet and nutrition. In Accra, Ghana, researchers have developed a partnership between the Food Research Institute and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. The partnership is helping to understand the nutritional needs of populations in three parts of the world, North America, South America and West Africa. Much of the nutrition technology coming from these studies show our problems and ways to overcome them are similar, at least in these three parts of the world. It is noted that the Purdue University Administrators are strong supporters of international programs. Peanut CRSP is a highly regarded program at the university, and the U.S.A. Principal Investigator (Dr. Richard Mattes), is highly regarded by his colleagues. He is a collaborating scientist on three CRSP programs (Peanut, Bean-Cowpea, and Sorghum-Millet). Dr. Mattes brings his nutrition expertise to these programs and a number of University Departments as he serves on key committees. Recently, he was instrumental in the development of a Nutragrain Bar made with bean paste fitting the sensory and nutritional needs of the peoples of Honduras, Central America.

"Previously fearful of the threat posed to his business by Chinese competitors, Wu feels he has a more accurate view of what he's up against. ""The Chinese don't have the imagination piece. This may be a cultural thing that's very hard to change. We have that in this country. Some countries are good at copying things. They are content takers, not makers. As a result, the takers are hiring Americans to do the imagination part because we are content makers. Just look at Apple. No surprise that most Asian car manufacturers design the cars here. Freedom is an integral part of this, and the Chinese don't have it and probably won't for the foreseeable future."" Hard to say how long the foreseeable is, but Wu plans to keep innovating and not wait to find out. He believes that part of imagination is sustainability and that it should be considered in everything the company does. He says sustainability generates imagination when you are forced to look at the whole process, the whole life cycle, as Infinity does with everything it repairs and sells. ""It's not easy and takes time. We start by telling people that they are unconscious and unskilled, and that at the end of the process they will be conscious and skilled. And finally they will be unconscious and skilled. In other words, looking at things in new ways will become second nature; they won't have to think about doing that."" It may sound ""very southern California,"" but Wu insists it works. ""We're all doing it, including me. We think it works. When we say you are unconscious and unskilled, don't take it personally; it's not a criticism. The goal is unconscious and skilled. The goal is for insights to become second nature. It's a long process."" Lastly, Wu has learned to be optimistic about the future of manufacturing in the United States. ""It has been more than 30 years since my parents overcame hardships in China to bring our family to the United States.

How did the Japanese demand for natural resources ( their Footprint ) , change since 1961 ?	Japan is one of the industrialized nations with the highest human development according to the UNDP. With an HDI of 0.953, it ranks 8th among 179 countries - ahead of Germany and the United States. While the Japanese population has grown relatively slowly (by about one-third from 1961 to 2005), no other country presented in this brochure has a higher population density. Japanese biocapacity has fallen both on a per capita basis and as a whole. In 2005, there was 0.6 gha of productive area per Japanese. The island chain comes in last in comparison to the countries presented in this brochure, in terms of biocapacity. How did the Japanese demand for natural resources (their Footprint), change since 1961? Both the total and the per capita Footprint grew due to increasing personal consumption over this time period, by a factor of 3.2 and a factor of 2.3, respectively. The average Footprint of a Japanese resident amounts to 4.9 gha. The country's demand for biocapacity exceeds its supply by more than eightfold. Japan has an ecological deficit of 4.3 gha per capita and is, in per capita terms, the largest ecological debtor in the East Asian Pacific region. At the global level, Japan plays a large role in international trade. The country attempts to balance a portion of its ecological deficit through imports from other countries. The Japanese Footprint of imports is 2.8 gha per person, and their overall trade balance is negative - Japan imports more Ecological Footprint embodied in goods than it exports each year. Japan's ecological deficit may present risks for the country since the cost of emitting carbon will likely become higher, and resources for import will be in greater demand. However, Japan's high population density may allow for more effective investment in low-carbon infrastructure and transportation systems in the future, which will help mitigate these risks. 0 40 80 120 19 61 19 65 19 69 19 73 19 77 19 81 19 85 19 89 19 93 19 97 20 01 20 05 population in millions biocapacity and footprint in GHA per person Population Footprint Biocapacity 1 3 5 GHA/person World Japan Footprint 2.7 4.9 biocapacity 2.1 0.6 Part 6 national footprints: Living on large feet and on small .

This more granular knowledge is fundamental for our long-term security , and is also part of our research agenda .	During the so called green revolution of the past years and decades massive amounts of artificial fertilizer was put on fields throughout the world which led to higher biocapacity. But ultimately that is fossil energy, because fertilizer is produced from natural gas. The criticism is; fossil energy sources are finite. The harvests are therefore unsustainable, consequently, the Footprint is calculating with unrealistic numbers. We measure the amount of biocapacity that the Earth provides every year. If the biocapacity decreases because the inputs are no longer there or the soils are leached out or not enough water is available, then these will be shown in future accounts - through declining biocapacity. Our numbers are not predictive; rather, we document the way things are, year by year. Our analysis could be supplemented with more detailed in-country data, or by evaluating how much of today's biocapacity might become fragile in the future due to fossil fuel shortages, soil depletion or freshwater shortages.

We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional , social , cultural , and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming .	Rice farmer resilience: contextual drivers The results presented above illustrate that the majority of rice farmers have limited resilience to climate hazards; they persist in Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ a livelihood system typified by low-productivity rice cropping and ineffective coping strategies. These livelihoods are susceptible to losses from climate hazards and do not generate resources that farmers can utilize in response to climate impacts. This is a partial explanation as to why rice farmers lack resilience; it does not answer what led to this state occurring nor fully explain why it persists. To understand why such a state persists it is necessary to identify the underlying contextual drivers of this situation. We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional, social, cultural, and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming. Our research suggested that these underlying contextual drivers were (i) the institutions surrounding land ownership, (ii) the nature of formal institutional support, (iii) lack of employment diversity, and (iv) expenses related to cultural activities.

This holistic approach and the AU 's ambition to address the root causes of conflict offer real opportunities to mobilize an effective regional response for better protection of civilians , respect for human rights and tackling the entrenched culture of impunity .	"While 2017 saw protracted and, in some cases, deepening challenges to the state of human rights in Africa, it also offered hope and opportunities for change. A key source of hope lay in the countless people across the region who stood up for human rights, justice and dignity - often risking their lives and freedoms. Africa's regional bodies remained key to the realization of positive change; they too are presented with many opportunities. During the year, the AU endorsed an ambitious plan to realize its commitment to ""silence the guns"" by 2020. It embarked on a major institutional reform agenda, which includes mobilizing significant resources for its operations and for peace and security interventions. This holistic approach and the AU's ambition to address the root causes of conflict offer real opportunities to mobilize an effective regional response for better protection of civilians, respect for human rights and tackling the entrenched culture of impunity. The year also marked the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which - despite many challenges - made significant contributions towards the promotion and protection of human rights, including by formulating an impressive list of instruments and standards. In 2017 alone, the Commission adopted at least 13 such instruments; these gave specific content to the broad provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. The Commission should build on these successes and work towards refining and strengthening its processes and mechanisms; it needs to develop a single set of consolidated state reporting guidelines and to apply consistently the Commission's procedure for following up the implementation of its decisions and recommendations to states."

Individuals underpin demand for English education Individual demand is the largest single driver of English education in Nigeria, with 22 of 30 companies citing this as the prime factor. The reasons are simple: ambitious Nigerians know that to gain the strongest possible competitive edge in the job market, a good level of spoken and written English is required. As a result, there is strong demand for private language courses where state-educated students are looking to improve their level of English. According to the US Agency of International Development, more than 50 new private language schools opened over 2007-2009 in Lagos, many managed by Nigerians who have returned to the country after living abroad, particularly from the UK and US. Fourteen of thirty respondents also cited the Nigerian Government as a principal demand driver for English education. Government policy is to promote English as a means of standardising communication in the country, and thus the language is taught throughout the school system. However, despite increasing government expenditure on education, which grew by 12% over 2008- 2010 to reach US$1.3 billion, as well as the implementation of programmes and projects by local authorities and NGOs, the quality of English education is still poor in state-funded schools due to the lack of resources, such as enough schools, energy and water supply, and qualified teachers. particularly in rural locations. Eight of thirty interviewees also claimed that businesses are driving demand for English learning. There is pressure to maintain standards of English within the workforce, as English is the international business language. Moreover, market research, news and training manuals are increasingly published in English, and an ability to understand and use these tools is vital for a company.

One in four (24 percent) grows only food crops --they are poorer on average. Traditionally, cash crops have received the most attention.

Currently, there is no single straightforward measure of poverty from a gender perspective, and no single internationally agreed-upon indicator that can give more meaningful poverty counts for women and men. That would require taking into account intra-household inequality, including through the use of some individuallevel indicators on selected dimensions of poverty (see box 8.2 on multidimensional poverty). Nevertheless, recent methodological developments suggest a shiftin thinking on poverty and gender from a perspective focused on the household as an economic unit, to women and men with individual agency (capacity for individualized choice or action) and specific constraints, needs and preferences. This would include the measurement, at the individual level, of asset ownership (see box 8.5); individual experience of food insecurity (see box 8.4); and individual access to formal financial services (section B.2). a United Nations, 2014b.

The third section features recent , selected contributions from academia and intergovernmental organizations , and the reach and impact of some of the migration research materials published .	"It is important to highlight at the outset that there are fundamental differences in the publishing processes for academic and non-academic material, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The academic publishing system is largely focused on producing journal articles and books. This process typically involves multi-stage reviews and editorial comments involving authors, editors and reviewers. Most published academic research (""white"" literature) is behind paywalls (that is, not freely accessible), and often managed by commercial publishers. In contrast, the production of research and analysis publications outside of academic publishing (""grey"" literature) generally involves faster and simpler processes that are typically, although not always, characterized by more limited peer review. Contributions from grey literature (such as research reports, working papers and government/official documents) are usually freely available. A report such as this, designed to contribute to our collective understanding of migration and mobility in an increasingly interconnected world, would clearly be incomplete without describing the role of grey literature, which has been ""recognized as a key source of evidence, argument, innovation, and understanding"".6 The volume, diversity and growth of both white and grey literature preclude a systematic review of all the material produced and published on migration in 2017 and 2018. Instead, this chapter highlights examples of key contributions made during this period, published in English by a selection of academic journals and intergovernmental organizations. It provides an update to the chapter in World Migration Report 2018, including by focusing on different academic journals and intergovernmental organizations, and their key output in 2017 and 2018.7 The next section provides an overview of the different actors involved in migration research and analysis.

It welcomes more international visitors than any other country in the region and its T&T industry benefits from a large and growing domestic market. The cornerstone of China's competitiveness is its exceptional natural resources (4th) as well as the TTCI's highest score for cultural resources. The nation has the greatest number of UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites in the world as well as impressive wildlife (6th). It also ranks first on intangible heritage and cultural and entertainment digital demand, second for sports stadiums and eight for business events.

The private sector is the key engine of job creation, accounting for 90 percent of all jobs in the developing world.

The evidence suggests that, depending on the country, gender discrimination or barriers for persons with disabilities (e.g. lack of accessibility and discrimination on the grounds of disability) may play a bigger role. In Benin, Mali, South Sudan and Togo, the gap is wider between women (both with and without disabilities) and men, but narrower between women with and without disabilities. The ratios of men with disabilities who have ever attended school are closer to those of men without disabilities. This suggests that gender discrimination plays a major role in schooling. In Brazil, Indonesia, Tunisia and Timor-Leste, the gap is wider between persons with disabilities (both women and men) and persons without disabilities. In these countries, the percentage of women without disabilities who have ever attended school is close to that of men without disabilities, thus suggesting that attitudinal and physical barriers against persons with disabilities are a factor explaining the low rates of school attendance of women with disabilities.

Involvement of women and men in the management of the environment Loss of natural resources and environmental degradation are a growing concern worldwide. According to The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015, the stress on renewable water resources is severe in some regions, particularly Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. In 2014, only 15.2percent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 8.4percent of coastal marine areas (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) were protected. The annual net loss of forests declined from 8.3 million hectares worldwide in 1991-2000 to 5.2 million hectares in 2001-2010.82 Nevertheless, the loss of these forests continues to threaten biodiversity, increase soil erosion and contribute to the high level of emissions of carbon into the atmosphere.83 Emissions of greenhouse gases due to human activity, of which carbon dioxide and methane are the most significant, are causing climate change.84 The world has almost eliminated the use of ozone-depleting substances, but global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have shown an overall upward trend in the past decades and are now more than 50percent higher than their 1990 level.85 Environmental protection, and consequently sustainable development, require that both women and men are actively involved, including through daily activities aimed at preserving natural resources and through participation in local and high-level environmental decisionmaking. Moreover, as emphasized in the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, the involvement of women in environmental decision-making at all levels is a key step to ensuring that women's issues and gender perspectives on the environment are included in policymaking from the local to national and global levels.86 82 United Nations, 2015. 83 ibid. 84 Intergovernmental panel on climate change, 2014. 85 United Nations, 2015. 86 United Nations, 1995.

Migrants' inclusion has always been an important part of the migration phenomenon; however, it is today a particularly complex issue. In an increasingly globalized world, the growth in the absolute number of migrants over the past 50 years and the diversification of migrants' origins, socioeconomic backgrounds and reasons for migrating have led to more social, cultural, ethnic and religious diversity in receiving societies.3 As a result, the impact of migration and diversity on social cohesion has become an important concern.4 This is illustrated by inclusion policies adopted by some States to frame the relationship between migrants and receiving communities and preserve social cohesion. These inclusion policies have taken multiple forms over time in different countries, reflecting societal values, including attitudes on immigration and diversity.

"Crop modeling to integrate knowledge Crop modeling enables researchers to integrate knowledge from different disciplines in a quantitative way. That, in turn, helps researchers to understand the underlying processes that determine the behavior of complex agricultural systems. Mathematical models are representations of systems made from mathematical equations. Integrating and solving the equations enable a numerical description of the system to be produced. During the first phase of a modeling exercise, the modeler seeks to give names, magnitudes, and units to the component parts of the problem. In the second phase of modeling a problem, the processes are described as mathematical functions. In the final phase, ""what-if"" questions can be asked about the functioning of a system and numerical answers provided. Mathematical models that contain no clear logical link with the basic processes governing the relationship between the system inputs and outputs are unlikely to contribute much of significance to any debate concerning strategic decisions in relation to research management."

Methods of Market Research Because of the expense of primary market research, most companies rely on secondary data sources. These three recommendations will help you obtain useful secondary information: 1. Keep abreast of world events that influence the international marketplace, watch for announcements of specific projects, or simply visit likely markets. For example, a thawing of political hostilities often leads to the opening of economic channels between countries. A steep depreciation in the value of the dollar can make your product considerably more competitive. The opposite can happen when the dollar appreciates, making some markets less attractive. 2. Analyze trade and economic statistics. Trade statistics are generally compiled by product category and by country. Such statistics provide your company with information concerning shipments of products over specified periods of time. Demographic and general economic statistics, such as population size and makeup, per capita income, and production levels by industry, can be important indicators of the market potential for your company's products. 3. Obtain advice from experts. There are several ways to obtain this advice: T Contact experts at the U.S. Department of Commerce and other government agencies. T Attend seminars, workshops, and international trade shows in your industry. T Hire an international trade and marketing consultant. T Talk with successful exporters of similar products, including members of District Export Councils in your local area. T Contact trade and industry associations.

In fact , some patterns in inequality in access to education are more pronounced in Coted'Ivoire than other Sub-Saharan African developing countries , and addressing access and enrollment in basic education remains an important policy consideration to ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school .	Participation in primary education has been negatively affected by the crisis between 2002 and 2011 and Coted'Ivoire has not yet fully caught up with other countries in the region.106 Before 2002 Coted'Ivoire was almost on par with average primary education enrollment rates for developing countries in Sub-Saharan African. However, the gross enrollment rate (GER), which measures total enrollment relative to the primary age population, has deteriorated from 2002. In 2002 gross enrollment was 77 percent and it decreased to as low as 70 percent in 2007. While there was some catch-up in enrollment during the years of peace between 2008 and 2010, where the rate stepped back up to around 73 percent, the most significant improvement came after 2011 when the rate increased to 90 percent by 2014. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to 16. This should help close the gap in enrollment rates with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa, where the GER in primary education was 99.6 percent in 2013.

"Plain Vanilla Vanilla was completely unknown to the Old World prior to 1492, but despite having little nutritional importance, it has become so widespread and so common that in English its name is used as an adjective to refer to anything that is ""plain, ordinary, or conventional."" Vanilla comes from the tropical forests of eastern and southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. It is from the fruit of Vanilla planifolia, the only species of the orchid family that produces edible fruit. Neither the vanilla flower nor its fruit, which takes the shape of a long pod, naturally has any noticeable flavor or scent. Vanilla pods must be fermented to produce the chemical compound vanillin, which gives the pods their distinctive vanilla flavor and scent (Rain, 1992, p. 37). It is unclear whether vanilla was first brought back to Spain by Cortes or another Spanish traveler. In any case, it achieved popularity quickly in Spain, where factories were using it to flavor chocolate by the second half of the sixteenth century. Like chocolate, it was considered a luxury for the wealthy. King Phillip II was known to have drunk vanilla-flavored chocolate as a nightcap. It was also quickly adopted by aristocratic circles in other parts of Europe. Queen Elizabeth I of England was also known to have been a frequent user of vanilla products (Rain, 1992, p. 40). In the eighteenth century, the French began to use it widely as a flavoring for confectionaries and ice, and also as a scent for perfumes and tobacco. French colonial islands began to attempt to systematically cultivate cuttings of the plant taken from the Americas. However, because of a lack of proper insects for pollination, initial attempts ended in failure (Bruman, 1948, pp. 371-72). It was not until after 1836, when Belgian botanist Charles Morren was able to hand-pollinate vanilla orchids, that the French were successfully cultivating plants that flowered (Morren, 1838). As shown in Panel A of Table 3, the French colonial islands of Reunion and French Polynesia and the former colonial island of Comoros continue to be large suppliers of vanilla today.

We are deepening our work both in India and globally. While continuing to increase the number of organic cotton farmers, we also focus on strengthening farmer collectives. We need to drive a shift from philanthropic to market based models. Simultaneously, we will continue to support OCA's work to bring the industry together and embed newer business models in the sourcing operations of brands. These business models are aimed at both improving the business case for farmers as well as the integrity for brands. OCA will also coordinate industry investments into areas, such as seed research and breeding. While actively engaging with agriculture universities, research institutes and seed companies to address the seed challenge, C&A Foundation is committed to contributing towards a robust global strategy for non-GM seed.

"Further , the word "" student "" will in this report be used for learners on all levels of education , rather than adding the word "" pupil "" that some still use ."	"9. The two most frequent terms used in this field are enterprise education and entrepreneurship education. The term enterprise education is primarily used in United Kingdom, and has been defined as focusing more broadly on personal development, mindset, skills and abilities, whereas the term entrepreneurship education has been defined to focus more on the specific context of setting up a venture and becoming self-employed (QAA, 2012, Mahieu, 2006). In United States, the only term used is entrepreneurship education (Erkkila, 2000). Some researchers use the longer term enterprise and entrepreneurship education (See for example Hannon, 2005), which is more clear but perhaps a bit unpractical. Sometimes enterprise and entrepreneurship education is discussed by using the term entrepreneurship education only, which however opens up for misunderstanding. Erkkila (2000) has proposed the unifying term entrepreneurial education as encompassing both enterprise and entrepreneurship education. This term will be used extensively in this report to avoid confusion. Further, the word ""student"" will in this report be used for learners on all levels of education, rather than adding the word ""pupil"" that some still use. For an overview of terms, see figure 1. 10. In Northern and Eastern Europe some additional terms are used. In Sweden and the Balkans the term entrepreneurial learning is often used as an equivalent to enterprise education (See for example Leffler and Falk-Lundqvist, 2013, Heder et al., 2011). This sometimes causes confusion, since it is the same term used in the research domain of entrepreneurial learning, which is about studying how entrepreneurs learn outside of the educational domain. Another set of terms used in Finland is internal entrepreneurship education and external entrepreneurship education (See for example Seikkula-Leino et al., 2010). Internal entrepreneurship education is a synonym to enterprise education, and external entrepreneurship education is a synonym to entrepreneurship education. Adding to the confusion here is the fact that internal entrepreneurship is sometimes used as a synonym to intrapreneurship, i.e. when acting entrepreneurially in an established organization (See for example Burgelman, 1983). 9 ."

This will initiate activities and awareness raising campaigns within the region .	Roll out of the South African programme to the southern African region The Programme will seek to replicate these activities to the extent possible throughout the southern African region. The regional activities will be steered through a Regional Programme Task Force (RPTF) comprising representatives from each of the southern African countries, including the Island States. The RPTF will be assembled through nominations from the appropriate ministries within each country, and will convene an initial meeting in Cape Town to develop a regional action plan. Follow-up meetings of the RPTF will be held within other countries of the region. GloBallast funds will be used to survey two ports within the region for the presence of alien species. This will initiate activities and awareness raising campaigns within the region. Mr. Adnan Awad has been employed by IMO to implement the Programme in South Africa.

As some children struggle to keep up with their schoolwork , home tuition in particular plays a very important part in helping the weaker students cope with today 's competitive learning environment .	Private tutoring in English is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. During recent decades, it has grown to become a vast enterprise. A huge number of children receive this private supplementary tutoring in English in Bangladesh. Children receiving such tutoring are then able to perform better in school which is not a new phenomenon in Bangladesh but also other parts of the world. English is an international language and it is gaining more space in the national education curriculum in Bangladesh, at first, English was only an elective subject but now it is a compulsory subject. So, a substantial number of families hire private tutors of English for their sons and daughters to improve their English. Children's education is the top priority for most of the parents. As some children struggle to keep up with their schoolwork, home tuition in particular plays a very important part in helping the weaker students cope with today's competitive learning environment. In fact, home tuition has long been an integral part of our education scene. So in many ways private tutoring is necessary especially for Bangla medium young learners or primary school students in Bangladesh. While private tutoring have positive consequences, such as improving students learning, employment for tutors, help to get good grades in exam, it also have negative consequences, like pressure on young learners, establish social inequalities, de-motivated to learn in the mainstream system and manipulation of students by tutors. Therefore, this study aims to find out the reasons and necessity of private tutoring in English for primary school students in Bangladesh.

There are demands on nature that are significant but are not, or are not adequately, documented in UN statistics. Examples include data on the biological impact of water scarcity or pollution, and the impact of waste on bioproductivity. Some of the aforementioned distortions generate margins of error on both sides of the data point, but errors leading to an under-reporting of global ecological overshoot almost certainly outweigh the other errors. With every round of improvement in the Accounts and the ongoing integration of more comprehensive data sets and independent data sources, the consistency and reliability of data can be checked more effectively, and the robustness of the calculations will improve. Overall, Ecological Footprint calculations and the data sources employed have improved significantly since the 1990s, as additional digitized data have been added to the National Footprint Accounts and internal cross-checking and data set correspondence checks have been introduced. There is significant opportunity for methodological improvement. A research paper written by more than a dozen Footprint researchers, including members of the National Accounts Committee, identified open research topics for improving the existing National Footprint Account methods (Kitzes et al. 2007a).

"Many of those taking action to demand respect for human rights and accountability for violations were demonized and criminalized, leading to shrinking civic space. Police and security forces persecuted human rights defenders. Extrajudicial killings, torture and other illtreatment, and enforced disappearances persisted with impunity. The Myanmar security forces' campaign of violence against the Rohingya people in northern Rakhine State, which amounted to crimes against humanity, created a human rights and humanitarian crisis in the country and in neighbouring Bangladesh. Lawlessness and violence increased further in the Philippines. The President's contempt for human rights in the""war on drugs"" was characterized by mass killings, mostly of people from poor and marginalized groups, including children. The scope of the killings and rampant impunity led to growing calls for an investigation at the international level.

Strong productivity growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversified the cash crop mix, but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products. The expansion of rice, cotton, and cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective (Figure7). Rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. Cotton and cashew producers make most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive employment. An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Vegetable production is also highly labor intensive, but its potential has so far not been fully exploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but scope for improvement remains.

Controlling for other factors, per capita consumption was 9 percent higher among cocoa growers compared with those not growing export crops. Households growing oil palm, rubber, and cotton had even higher per capita consumption, averaging 10, 17 and 23 percent higher, respectively, than farmers that did not grow export crops. 39 Poorer rural households rely heavily on crop production.

For their part, governments should take advantage of training programs offered by international organizations--both for newly recruited employees as well as for experienced customs officers and executives.15 The future orientation of customs will require a transition toward a knowledge-based model.16 Greater investment in the education and skills development of clearance officials is important. The World Bank Group's Customs Modernization Handbook 2005--which emphasized human resources management--identified the education and training of staff as the most important factor affecting customs performance, a view that has been reiterated by several recent studies.17 Education also improves the transferability of skills18 and is key to building technology absorption capacity.19 Providing regular training to customs clearance officials is positively related to customs efficiency.

When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.	As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities.

They are also the interpreters of religious teachings and the performers of rituals , especially on the death of parents , which include feeding a large number of people , sometimes several villages .	"In almost all regions, the practice is rooted in culture and the economics of son preference, these factors playing a major role in the low valuation and neglect of female children. The practice of son preference emerged with the shift from subsistence agriculture, which was primarily controlled by women, to settled agriculture, which is primarily controlled by men. In the patrilineal landowning communities with settled agriculture which are prevalent in the Asian region, the economic obligations of sons towards parents are greater. The son is considered to be the family pillar, who ensures continuity and protection of the family property. Sons provide the workforce and have to bring in a bride-""an extra pair of hands"". Sons are the source of family income and have to provide for parents in their old age. They are also the interpreters of religious teachings and the performers of rituals, especially on the death of parents, which include feeding a large number of people, sometimes several villages.

Contemporary situations are also examined through the lens of history , which makes it possible to grasp ruptures and continuities and to develop comparative perspectives .	"Contemporary situations are also examined through the lens of history, which makes it possible to grasp ruptures and continuities and to develop comparative perspectives. This was the case in the dossier on ""Romanian Roma migration in Europe: inclusion policies, strategies for distinguishing and (de)building identity borders"" coordinated by Mihaela Nedelcu and Ruxandra-Oana Ciobanu (32/1, 2016). It is also the perspective adopted in the dossier ""Migratory movements of yesterday and today in Italy"" coordinated by Paola Corti and Adelina Miranda (34/1, 2018) which critically reviews Italy's migratory history, at a time when this country is becoming increasingly present on the international scene due to policies of refoulement of foreigners at national borders. The analysis of the Italian case suggests, in the wake of the migration studies, that it is not possible to define the migration fields within which old and new protagonists move through the simple analysis of territorial trajectories. The research presented shows, on the one hand, that the adoption of a distant perspective is essential to relativize current analyses and, on the other hand, it shows the heuristic interest in varying the focus of the historical perspective on migration facts. Similarly, since it is no longer conceivable to use categories that semantically reflect the typologies used by a political discourse that instrumentalize them, it is useful to consider the various spatial-political scales - local, regional, national and international - while appropriating the subjective level to understand the complexity of the phenomenon. This historical perspective is also present in the dossier ""Training elites: mobility of students from Africa north of the Sahara in the countries of the former socialist bloc"" coordinated by Michele Leclerc-Olive and Marie-Antoinette Hily (32/2, 2016), which sheds light on a forgotten part of our history, examines collaboration between countries in the name of an ideological project, and the ""qualified migration"" that these programmes generate between these States. The presentation of these experiences leads to a discussion of the descriptive categories of these ""mobilities"" and ""elites""."

The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities , especially in light manufacturing .	The movement of labor out of agriculture has been facilitated by close urban proximity, resulting from Bangladesh's high population density. Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors. The ready- Urbanizing countries Urbanizing countries endowed with abundant unskilled labor have the potential to enter a virtuous jobs circle. The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities, especially in light manufacturing. These jobs may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and limited or negligible benefits, but in general they are preferable to jobs in agriculture. They can also be the entry point to a process of economic and technological upgrading that leads to better jobs in the future.34 Employment opportunities for the unskilled thus provide avenues out of poverty for large numbers of households. In countries in which women's jobs choices have been restricted, new employment opportunities in urbanizing economies can bring about important changes at the household and society levels.

The splintering of production tasks has facilitated their delocalization and outsourcing to developing countries, resulting in greater trade volumes and lower prices of final goods. But it has also led to a global redistribution of jobs in manufacturing, and the same trend is increasingly visible in services as well.

"One year after the reform of the primary education system that aimed to facilitate the inclusion of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds into mainstream schools, Roma children continued to face discrimination in access to education. In July, the government published data which showed that over 24% of Roma pupils continued to be educated in ethnically segregated schools. In March, a district court ordered a primary school in the city of Ostrava to apologize to two Roma pupils. The school had refused to register the pupils in 2014, claiming that it had reached full capacity. Legal guardians of the pupils complained that the director justified his decision by claiming that nonRoma parents could start removing their children from the school as there were already nine Roma pupils registered in that grade. The court held that a fear of ""white flight"" could not justify the treatment of pupils on the basis their ethnicity. RIGHT TO HOUSING In July, an amendment to the law on welfare benefits entered into force and dozens of municipalities announced that they would restrict access to housing allowances. The amendment allows municipalities to declare zones of ""socially pathological behaviour"" where residents would be barred from claiming some housing allowances.

At the global level, GPE is taking action on a variety of fronts, primarily through the implementation of the Gender Equality Strategy 2016-2020 (Box 2.1). In the realm of advocacy, GPE is working with partners to build political support for girls' education and gender equality. For example, the Secretariat is working to ensure that girls' education is a key theme at the landmark Women Deliver global conference in June 2019, and engaging with the African Union Child Marriage campaign and Gender is My Agenda Campaign to provide an education perspective. GPE is a member of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI) working group on school-related gender-based violence, and is working with the Safe to Learn campaign to end violence in schools.

Before this adjustment, larger firms seem to account for most job creation and destruction. But the adjustment shows that microenterprises contribute about 80 percent of gross job flows. This estimate should not be taken literally, because the microenterprises for which information on job creation and destruction is available are not necessarily representative--the Chilean census started to include microenterprises only in the late 1990s. But even with a margin of error, the estimate is so large that it changes the picture of job creation and job destruction.

There are general secondary education schools, special schools for the physically or mentally handicapped within the system of general and vocational education, and full-or part-time vocational schools (10th/11th grade on). Four main types of general secondary schools covering compulsory schooling exist: Haupschule, Realschule, Gymnasium and Gesamtschule. Types and names of schools offering several courses of education at lower secondary level differ according to Lander. Secondary education is compulsory and tuition is free. Textbooks and other school material are either free or lent out. From grade 10, pupils may obtain grants if no other financial sources exist.

Environment 177 are members of local management groups, their opinions may not be given the same weight as those of men, or may be discouraged altogether.95 In some cases, women in local management of natural resources are able to bring positive changes; in others, however, they continue to face challenges. For example, some case studies in India and Nepal showed that greater participation by women in forest governance can foster more equitable distribution practices for forest access and goods, greater influence over funding allocations for women, stronger efforts to overcome fuel shortages, and improved conservation practices and resource regeneration.96 However, other studies, in Bolivia, Kenya, Mexico and Uganda showed that forest user groups with higher participation of women tended to be less effective due to women's lower access to technology, labour constraints and limited authority.97 Women are underrepresented in local management of forests Women participate far less than men in formal forest user groups. Their low participation in forest management, illustrated previously in research literature analysing results from qualitative and small quantitative case studies in developing countries, has been confirmed by a comparative multi-country study98 conducted in 2005-2008 in 24 developing countries covering the major tropical forest regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.99 Gender parity in local forest governance is far from being achieved in each of the three regions covered (figure 7.9). The study also showed that in about half the sites covered by the study, women were not involved at all in forest user groups.

Several systematic reviews and other studies demonstrate the effectiveness of various types of CHWs in delivering a range of preventive, promotive and curative services related to reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (4-8), infectious diseases (9), noncommunicable diseases (10, 11), and neglected tropical diseases (12). However, successful delivery of services requires evidence-based models for educating, deploying, remunerating and managing CHWs to optimize their performance and contribution to the health system across various health service areas. Other systematic reviews have identified the most effective policy approaches for successful integration of health workers into health systems and the communities they serve. These include providing CHWs with predictable financial and non-financial incentives, frequent supportive supervision, continuous training, and embedding CHWs in health systems and in the communities where they work, with clear roles and communication channels for CHWs (13-17). There is also substantial evidence that delivering essential health services through CHWs may represent a cost-effective approach in a diversity of contexts (18-20). Empowering CHWs also offers a critical opening for change towards achieving greater gender equity within communities. 19 Rationale The support for CHWs and their integration into the health system and in the communities they serve are uneven across and within countries; good-practice examples are not necessarily replicated and policy options for which there is greater evidence of effectiveness are not uniformly adopted.	These include providing CHWs with predictable financial and non-financial incentives, frequent supportive supervision, continuous training, and embedding CHWs in health systems and in the communities where they work, with clear roles and communication channels for CHWs (13-17).

The intention is that children enter the former at age 7, and remain there for 6 years, while they learn the basics of the same subjects that children learn everywhere. The secondary school model is a 2-tier one. After the first 4 of 7 years, examinations are held for the certificate of the lower cycle of secondary study, or brevet d'etude du premier cycle. With this in hand, students could go out to work, move on to a college or lycee, or enter a teacher-training institution.

Use of technologies adaptable/appropriate to Senegal include local clays, UV light for aflatoxin detoxification by cottage level peanut processors, peanut milk and protein isolates for protein deficient children, and fish by-products used to produce high protein peanut-based snacks. Peanut-based fish nuggets could enable recovery of fish by-products in Senegal and the U.S., where fishing industries are strong, and add value thereby enhancing both the fish and peanut industries. Product development: Two high-protein baked snacks from defatted peanut flour were developed and tested in the U.S. and Senegal: (1) cookies, and (2) chin-chin (a West African snack). Substitution of up to 40% roasted defatted peanut flour yielded snacks that was most acceptable to consumers. U.S. and West African sensory panels tested both snacks; the West African panel gave higher acceptability ratings to peanut-based snacks especially chin-chin compared to the U.S. panel. Shelf-life of chin-chin was determined to be good. The high protein-low fat products have health implications. Peanut milk from defatted peanut flour is being developed in Senegal by collaborating researchers for testing for acceptance by Senegalese consumers. Assessment of the level of aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products in Senegal, through sampling, was carried out. The results provided baseline on health risks to consumers and provide guidance on ways to reduce aflatoxin especially at the village/small-scale processor level. Aflatoxin detoxification: B1 and G1 Aflatoxin detoxification of peanut products using Senegalese Attapulgite clay was tested in Senegal in collaboration with NCA&T researchers. Addition of clay as low as 0.5% level resulted to non-detectable levels of aflatoxin in all samples. Samples of all peanut products in local markets in Senegal showed aflatoxin contamination; the products showing high levels of over 30% were: crude peanut oil (92%), peanut cake (90%), and peanut paste (55%), and kernels in local market (30%). Sorting and removal of skins proved effective in lowering aflatoxin for some uses, and the utilization of the Senegalese attapulgite clay reduced aflatoxin to none detectable levels in other uses of peanut.

In order to seek input from a variety of participants in Eastern and Southern Africa, meetings were held in three different locations. The first meeting was held at SG Resort in Arusha, Tanzania on 27th and 28th March, 2014 in partnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Selian Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) in Tanzania. Twenty-four participants (10 females and 14 males) attended the Tanzania event. Each agenda reflects the availability and needs from the host country, and therefore have slight variations in regard to time and sequence. The Tanzania event was scheduled for two days. Each event covered similar topics as described above, and all three covered a SWOT analysis exercise. Participants were asked to brainstorm ideas and compile feedback on various aspects in regard to SI. For clarification purposes, a SWOT analysis is a strategy commonly used in strategic program planning. It provides a simple framework for an entity to scan both the internal and external environment. The SWOT analysis provides information that is helpful in matching the entity's resources and capabilities to the environment in which it operates. It also acts as a filter to reduce the information generated through the exercise to a manageable number of key issues. As the name implies, a SWOT analysis consists of four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. These categories can further be defined as either internal or external factors. Strengths and weaknesses are often internal to an entity. Opportunities and threats tend to be external factors, often beyond the control of the FtF Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab (SIIL) -1 - SWOT Analysis Report - Tanzania entity/organization, but that impact and/or influence operations. The following matrix presents the components of the SWOT analysis.

In May 2018 , the government adopted ministerial decree No. 417 , publishing a list of 100 economic activities in sectors requiring government authorization for investment .	Entering Tunisia's domestic market, particularly the services sector, remains difficult for foreign investors. Foreign investment is limited to 49 percent in many sectors, and the process of investing is particularly challenging in areas that are not government priorities (i.e., where there are no public tenders). Under Tunisia's investment code, high-value joint ventures with a foreign investor must be approved by the Tunisian government, which assesses the potential benefit of the investment to the Tunisian economy. Investors in Tunisia frequently complain of delays, lack of transparency regarding rules and fees, competition from state-owned enterprises, and other bureaucratic complications in the process of registering a business. Provisions in Tunisian commercial legislation designed to protect minority shareholder interests confer disproportionate influence on Tunisian minority partners. On April 1, 2017, a new Tunisian Investment Law intended to facilitate increased foreign investment into Tunisia took effect. In May 2018, the government adopted ministerial decree No. 417, publishing a list of 100 economic activities in sectors requiring government authorization for investment.

In fact , compared to VCs , BAs invest in a wider range of sectors , including traditional ones , and geographies , which are not limited to VC hotbeds and are typically related to the BA 's entrepreneurial experience and personal networks .	Profile of firms 393. Angel investment concerns mainly seed and early stage companies, including young firms that are beyond the start-up phase but need capital to develop their product or business strategy. BAs invest largely, though not exclusively, in knowledge-based sectors. In fact, compared to VCs, BAs invest in a wider range of sectors, including traditional ones, and geographies, which are not limited to VC hotbeds and are typically related to the BA's entrepreneurial experience and personal networks. However, a common trait of the target companies is a high-growth potential and likelihood to generate substantial revenues over the mid-to long-term (3-8 years). In other terms, BAs and VCs look for scalable investments, that is, companies that can substantially grow their revenues within a few years (Villalobos and Payne, 2007). 394. As is the case for VCs, angel investors bridge the financing gap for new ventures that is largely due to information asymmetry. Since they tend to invest in an earlier stage of the business development than VCs, for BAs the asymmetry may be even more relevant. This also explains the greater emphasis placed by BAs on the personal relationship and trust with the entrepreneur, who should be willing to relinquish some control on the firm and accept an active role of the BA in the development of the business strategy. 395. Generally, the most appropriate time for companies to seek angel investment is when a product or service is developed or near completion and there exists a base of customers or potential customers that confirmed their interest in buying it. BAs are usually under little pressure to make an investment in order to generate income or capital growth. They can afford to wait until they identify the right opportunity and the right person. This means that entrepreneurs that seek angel investments need to be able to present not only an appealing idea and business plan but also themselves effectively (Stuart et al., 2007).	In fact, compared to VCs, BAs invest in a wider range of sectors, including traditional ones, and geographies, which are not limited to VC hotbeds and are typically related to the BA's entrepreneurial experience and personal networks.

Between 2012/13 and 2016/17, there has been growth in the number of farmers in India joining organic cultivation systems. However, during this time, production of organic cotton in some areas was replaced by production of other organic crops, as farmers respond to changes in the market. Additionally, a small but important portion of previously certified farmers have been demoted back to in-transition status as they resolve contamination problems. As a result, India's organic cotton production experienced an overall decline during this period, but that trend is now stabilizing. The decline between 2015/16 and 2016/17 was only 1.2 percent, compared to 20 percent the previous season, and the future looks bright as strong growth is forecast over the next few years.

The categories system and Ramsar sites In the original version of the management categories, biosphere reserves and World Heritage sites were identified as a category in their own right, yet Ramsar sites were not so identified. Subsequently, the 1994 guidelines did not treat any international designation as a separate category. It was agreed at the Ramsar Ninth Conference of Parties (Resolution IX.22) to include data about the IUCN category within the database of Ramsar sites. Out of the 84 sites designated since 1st January 2007, 37 (44 percent) include information on the IUCN category. Ramsar sites are nationally designated. The IUCN categories system is a means of classifying them on the basis of management objectives. Ramsar sites cut right across this approach because the very concept embodies the idea of a range of management objectives. On the other hand, some Ramsar sites often contain a series of management zones with differing management objectives, each of which may correspond to a category in the IUCN system.

Much of this increase has come in Heilongjiang and the other two northeastern provinces of Jilin and Liaoning , but production has also expanded noticeably in Henan and Shandong .	China is the world's largest rice producer, accounting for 32-35% of total world production (India has a larger rice area harvested, but lower per hectare yields). Except for Japan and the Republic of Korea, rice yields in China are the highest in Asia, due in part to favorable growing conditions. Rice area harvested has declined from its peak of 37 million hectares in the mid-1970s to just over 30 million ha today. The decline in area has been due to both economic reforms that reduced government requirements to grow rice and economic development that increased the opportunity cost of land. In recent years, much of the fall in rice area has occurred in coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Zhejiang. Hunan is the largest rice producing province, and most rice production is in the Yangtze River Valley (or further south) where ample supplies of water are available. However, rice production in northern China has increased substantially in recent years, with its share of national production nearly doubling from 7.6% in 1989 to 13.3% in 1999. Much of this increase has come in Heilongjiang and the other two northeastern provinces of Jilin and Liaoning, but production has also expanded noticeably in Henan and Shandong.

"Keywords: Nursing regulation, nursing education and practice, nursing regulation worldwide, Global Regulatory Atlas From its inception, nursing has been a global profession. Nurses have cared for patients in their respective countries and traversed the planet to provide care where needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated 2020--the bicentennial of Florence Nightingale's birth--as the ""Year of the Nurse and Midwife."" Nightingale embodied the cosmopolitanism that still infuses the nursing profession. By the age of 34 years, Florence was internationally famous for her service in Turkey as part of the British Army's employment of female nurses during the Crimean War. Nightingale and her fellow nurses practiced in the crosshairs of this flashpoint far beyond the confines of Victorian society traditionally placed on women and introduced hospital reforms and regulations. As we reflect on the 200 years that elapsed since the advent of modern nursing, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) reaffirms its commitment to regulatory excellence by forging the Global Profile of Nursing Regulation, Education, and Practice, an innovative initiative for information sharing and data collection among nurse regulators worldwide."

The Amnesty International Report 2017/18 shines a light on the state of the world's human rights during 2017. The foreword, five regional overviews and a survey of 159 countries and territories from all regions document the struggle of many people to claim their rights, and the failures of governments to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. Yet there are also glimpses of hard-won progress, demonstrating that the defence of human rights does yield positive developments. This report pays tribute to the human rights defenders who continue to fight for change, sometimes risking their own lives in the process. In a year when austerity measures and natural disasters pushed many into deeper poverty and insecurity, this year's report also shines a spotlight on economic, social and cultural rights.

"The scholarly dissemination system rotates around a well-established gravitational centre: publication, with some forms of publication (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than others (and within that, individual academic publishers have different standings). Publishing the results of research in academic journals is without any doubt the paramount objective of today's scholars.1 Journals alone constitute about 40 per cent (books 16%) of the revenues of the broader scientific, technical and medical publisher's market, the size of which has been estimated at USD 25.2 billion in 2013.2 Through academic publishing, scholars formally share their findings within the scientific community. This exchange enables other researchers to learn about the latest advancements, to design new studies for filling current knowledge gaps, to compare their findings with the ones of their peers and perhaps to avoid reinventing the wheel. Moreover, publication constitutes ""...a permanent record of what has been discovered, when and by whom - like a court register for science"".3 The world's first academic journal - Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society - appeared as early as of 1665, as an expression of the Royal Society's policy of promoting the progress of science through open sharing of results and ideas supported by empirical evidence. Since then, the number of active scholarly peer-reviewed English language journals had reached 28,100 in 2014,4 and it has been calculated that the global scientific output doubles every nine years.5 Many scholars today are overwhelmed by the mass of academic literature, and it is becoming impossible to find the time to read every piece of literature, even on the narrowest topic."

The national poverty rate in Mozambique is 69.4 percent. Two thirds of the population lives in absolute poverty with income below the established poverty line of US$0.40 per day. The poverty rate is higher in rural areas (71.2 percent) compared with urban areas (62 percent) and about 82 percent of the poor live in rural areas. Mozambique has a total population of 17,656,150.7 In the past ten years, since the end of the 17-year civil war, Mozambique has shown a tendency for strong economic growth. The government's main economic policies, as outlined in the poverty reduction strategy paper (PARPA) (GoM,2001), are to achieve high rates of economic growth, consolidate macroeconomic stability, and improve the delivery of social services. However, in January 2000, Mozambique was hit by devastating floods affecting the southern provinces of the country. In late February when Cyclone Eline hit the coast, there was a second wave of flooding in the provinces of Inhambane, Gaza, and Sofala. The dramatic nature of the floods resulted in an outpouring of goodwill and support; large amounts of emergency relief and recovery money were pledged to the victims of the disaster. The floods caused over US$750 million worth of damage and affected 2 million people. An estimated 500,000 people were left homeless or displaced. The large amounts of money received directly by the government of Mozambique or channeled through international agencies allowed the government and relief agencies to offer immediate support to the affected populations and also plan an extensive rehabilitation exercise. 7 World Food Summit document.

The following two subsections examine these labor supply and demand side considerations within the context of Coted'Ivoire. The working hypothesis is that, in general, as countries accelerate their develop, and in Coted'Ivoire today in particular, there is still a lot of scope for increasing earnings of the poor within agriculture. Increasing labor productivity in agriculture is also needed to help facilitate the labor movement out of agriculture (see section 2.2), which will in turn become more important as agricultural labor productivity increases and Engel's Law becomes more binding. This is not to say that facilitating labor movement out of agriculture is not part of the process, but rather to emphasize that lots of unexploited inclusive jobs potential remains in agriculture, which should be realized, also to facilitate the agricultural labor exit itself.

Traditional debt finance - bank loans, overdrafts, credit lines and the use of credit cards-is the most common source of external finance for many SMEs and entrepreneurs. The defining characteristic of straight debt instruments is that they represent an unconditional claim on the borrower, who must pay a specified amount of interest to creditors at fixed intervals, regardless of the financial condition of the company or the return on the investment. The interest rate may be fixed or adjusted periodically according to a reference rate. Straight debt does not include any features other than payment of interest and repayment of principal, i.e. it cannot be converted into another asset, and bank claims have high priority in cases of bankruptcy ('senior debt').

Doing Business 2020 also includes a literature review chapter on relevant research articles published in top-ranking economic journals since 2013 .	The contracting with the government case study measures the efficiency of public procurement. The case study describes a standardized scenario benchmarked by the indicator set and outlines a preliminary description of the methodology. Worldwide, public procurement accounts for 10-25% of GDP on average, and cumulatively governments spend $10 trillion on public contracts every year. The efficiency of the process varies considerably, however; currently, there are no global data to benchmark such practices. The contracting with the government database constitutes a repository of comparable data on how procurement processes are carried out. This indicator set, which has been under development for the past three years, will be included in the ease of doing business score in Doing Business 2021. 15Overview: Tackling burdensome regulation The case study on employing workers highlights the positive effects of flexible employment regulation for firms, which in turn affects job creation and productivity growth. It analyzes the advantages of operating under a less rigid hiring framework that, for example, permits fixed-term contracts. In light of the changing dynamics of work, the case study further examines the benefits of flexible rules on working hours. It shows that restrictions on dismissal due to redundancy hurt firms as well as youth employment.

Nine government institutions, either at the federal or state levels, are instrumental in the process of establishing the policy and legal framework relevant to landscape restoration in Quintana Roo (see Appendix 1, Table A1.3). CONAFOR is a key institution, promoting at least seven policies applied at the country level. Among these, the National Forestry Programme (PRONAFOR) represents the main operational instrument for the implementation of CONAFOR's Institutional Programme. PRONAFOR is the primary path for channelling public funds towards FLR and other activities related to sustainable forest management through the Mexican Forest Fund. Budget and operational rules established on a yearly basis determine PRONAFOR's implementation. Funds are channelled in the form of subsidies to potential beneficiaries through a set of different sub-programmes, each with specific eligibility criteria (size, location, land cover conditions, etc.).

In Bolivia: There have been significant outputs that are showing initial impact on peanut research and production in Bolivia. In four years, ANAPO led the development of a National Peanut Program and a Peanut Seed Production Program. The Bolivian Government has recognized ANAPO as the national reference institution for peanut research and development. This project has already resulted in increased peanut production, which is expected to stimulate the development of a local peanut industry. The area planted to peanut has increased from 2,000 ha in 2001 to 11,000 ha in 2004. Productivity of peanut has increased from less than 1.0 t/ha to 2.0-2.5 t/ha. Most farmers are small-scale producers with 1-5 hectare per farm. There has been increase in the capacity of ANAPO researchers and technicians resulting from shortterm training in the U.S. collaborating universities and from the sustained interaction of U.S. PIs during their visits to Bolivia. The new greenhouse funded by Peanut CRSP has improved the capacity of ANAPO to produce their own local crosses and maintain parent materials. In the United States: Improved germplasm and the potential to develop TSWV-resistant genotypes will have very strong applicability for the U.S. and other countries. Bolivia, in the region of the geographic origin of peanut, could provide wild relatives to be used by U.S. breeders in producing genotypes with specific characteristics such as disease resistance. This project will generate a wider range of improved germplasm, leading to new varieties with high yield and disease resistance. Already the project has generated interest with the U,S., and the Georgia Peanut Commission has been very Project UFL16P - 202 - supportive of the project. Two varieties from this project have already been entered in UPPT tests in the US for two years, and may result in variety release in 2006.

Other forms of asset-based finance , such as Purchase Order Finance and Warehouse Receipts , have received increasing attention in emerging economies , where international organisations and donors have been actively promoting projects intended to foster supply chain finance , as well as to develop stabilisation mechanisms in commodity markets .	Source: Klapper (2006), IFC (2010). 174. Other forms of asset-based finance, such as Purchase Order Finance and Warehouse Receipts, have received increasing attention in emerging economies, where international organisations and donors have been actively promoting projects intended to foster supply chain finance, as well as to develop stabilisation mechanisms in commodity markets. This is the case of programmes launched by USAID, which, based on the successful experience with these asset-based instruments in the United States, has introduced them in emerging markets such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, and South Africa, both through banks and specialised non-banking financial institutions (USAID, 2009). Box 4 illustrates the case of a POF pilot project in Bolivia.

In 2019 , overall response planning and implementation was further enriched by the collaboration between community engagement and accountability initiatives and the technical work delivered through various protection from sexual exploitation and abuse ( PSEA ) networks .	In 2019, overall response planning and implementation was further enriched by the collaboration between community engagement and accountability initiatives and the technical work delivered through various protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) networks. Effective community outreach and sensitization on PSEA in response to Cyclone Idai in Mozambique has been attributed to early interventions at the coordination level and highlighted as an important measure in supporting capacities across the response. As a priority for the IASC through its Results Group on Accountability and Inclusion, efforts are under way to harmonize and leverage the complementarities of these critical areas of accountability in Indonesia, Myanmar, South Sudan, Ukraine and Yemen.

In these Project PUR10U - 128 - countries, close relationships have been developed with consumers who participate in the studies as Subjects and benefit from the learning experience about their personal health relative to diet and nutrition. In Accra, Ghana, researchers have developed a partnership between the Food Research Institute and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. The partnership is helping to understand the nutritional needs of populations in three parts of the world, North America, South America and West Africa. Much of the nutrition technology coming from these studies show our problems and ways to overcome them are similar, at least in these three parts of the world. It is noted that the Purdue University Administrators are strong supporters of international programs. Peanut CRSP is a highly regarded program at the university, and the U.S.A. Principal Investigator (Dr. Richard Mattes), is highly regarded by his colleagues. He is a collaborating scientist on three CRSP programs (Peanut, Bean-Cowpea, and Sorghum-Millet). Dr. Mattes brings his nutrition expertise to these programs and a number of University Departments as he serves on key committees. Recently, he was instrumental in the development of a Nutragrain Bar made with bean paste fitting the sensory and nutritional needs of the peoples of Honduras, Central America.

In June, the Jamaica Constabulary Force completed an internal administrative review into the conduct of officers named in the Commissioners' report. However, it found no misconduct or responsibility for human rights violations during the state of emergency.

Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture , the largest sectors of employment in the economy .	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.

At the same time , the GOE approved the National Logistics Strategy , which permits the private sector to engage in multimodal transportation system to improve export competitiveness and efficiency .	Most goods continue to be transported by trucks to the Port of Djibouti; Ethiopia's government-owned trucking companies dominate the market, and the overall number of trucks is insufficient to meet demand. In November 2017, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway began operating on a very small scale, but currently is mainly transporting passengers. Plans to expand Ethiopia's rail systems beyond the Addis AbabaDjibouti link have been finalized, but construction, except for the Awash-Mekele rail line, has not begun due to a lack of financing. In September 2018, the government opened the logistics sector for foreign companies operating jointly with local partners holding minority shares. At the same time, the GOE approved the National Logistics Strategy, which permits the private sector to engage in multimodal transportation system to improve export competitiveness and efficiency. However, despite the change in legislation, private shippers and freight forwarders report they are still unable to engage in multimodal transportation. The recent political rapprochement with Eritrea, along with the GOE's recent purchase of a 19 percent share of Berbera Port in Somaliland, which is being developed by DP World, could also provide alternative routes to transport goods to markets, and should eventually improve logistics.

Given the sensitivities and complexities associated with resettlement, it is important that a thorough and independent participatory evaluation is undertaken of the resettlement program so that lessons can be learned for the future. 5.

Now , it is typically done in rotation with pasture ( two years of rice , three years of pasture ) or soybean .	"Much of Brazil's upland rice is planted on the Cerrado in central Brazil. Originally, rice was grown in this area primarily to facilitate deforestation. Now, it is typically done in rotation with pasture (two years of rice, three years of pasture) or soybean. Rotation is essential because of the ""yield collapse"" that occurs with continuous cultivation of such rice. In the second year of rice cultivation, yields typically decline by about 10%, but in the third year they can fall by as much as 70%. The cause of this problem has been variously attributed to autotoxicity, soil degradation, and soil pests. Thus, crop rotation is essential for profitable farm management."

Ponticelli and Alencar (2016) find that firms operating in Brazilian municipalities with less congested civil courts experienced a larger increase in the use of secured loans. In the years following a reform that increased the protection of secured creditors, firms also experienced a significant increase in investment and output value. These results underscore the importance of the timely enforcement of creditors' rights by the courts to improve access to finance.4 Faster and cheaper access to justice reduces some of the obstacles faced by entrepreneurs.

Traditional extension services are becoming less common across Africa, although the term is still used and applied to nontraditional approaches. Newer approaches empower farmers, in particular female farmers, and can be used to foster a more demand-orientated approach to learning where the farmers specify the information they require and select their provider of training (as described in Box 6.2). Finally, a growing and diversifying agricultural sector will create jobs that demand increasingly advanced technical and professional skills, from processing and marketing to agricultural research as has been described in Chapter2.

"Most published academic research ( "" white "" literature ) is behind paywalls ( that is , not freely accessible ) , and often managed by commercial publishers ."	"It is important to highlight at the outset that there are fundamental differences in the publishing processes for academic and non-academic material, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The academic publishing system is largely focused on producing journal articles and books. This process typically involves multi-stage reviews and editorial comments involving authors, editors and reviewers. Most published academic research (""white"" literature) is behind paywalls (that is, not freely accessible), and often managed by commercial publishers. In contrast, the production of research and analysis publications outside of academic publishing (""grey"" literature) generally involves faster and simpler processes that are typically, although not always, characterized by more limited peer review. Contributions from grey literature (such as research reports, working papers and government/official documents) are usually freely available. A report such as this, designed to contribute to our collective understanding of migration and mobility in an increasingly interconnected world, would clearly be incomplete without describing the role of grey literature, which has been ""recognized as a key source of evidence, argument, innovation, and understanding"".6 The volume, diversity and growth of both white and grey literature preclude a systematic review of all the material produced and published on migration in 2017 and 2018. Instead, this chapter highlights examples of key contributions made during this period, published in English by a selection of academic journals and intergovernmental organizations. It provides an update to the chapter in World Migration Report 2018, including by focusing on different academic journals and intergovernmental organizations, and their key output in 2017 and 2018.7 The next section provides an overview of the different actors involved in migration research and analysis. The third section features recent, selected contributions from academia and intergovernmental organizations, and the reach and impact of some of the migration research materials published."

Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education .	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education.

CHWs are uniquely suited to engage communities and lead community mobilization efforts by identifying and recruiting additional resources for health , working with communities to identify health priorities , and mobilizing key stakeholders .	"Community mobilization is a process of raising a community's awareness of an issue and involvement in identifying and activating resources and leadership to address it. Community mobilization has long been recognized as a critical strategy for improving health outcomes, and there exists a rich body of literature evidencing successful mobilization on a range of health issues (234-237). CHWs are uniquely suited to engage communities and lead community mobilization efforts by identifying and recruiting additional resources for health, working with communities to identify health priorities, and mobilizing key stakeholders. However, previous reviews of literature examining the tasks that CHWs perform provide little evidence of CHWs being conceptualized as community mobilizers (17). 7.14.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that the evidence found on this question suggests, but does not provide conclusive evidence of, a positive potential for a role for CHWs in mobilizing community resources for health. No known or theoretical risks arising from such activities were identified through the review of the evidence and the GDG discussions. As the evidence was extremely limited in volume and scope, and characterized by a very low level of certainty on the effects, the GDG adopted a conditional recommendation in favour of the policy option under consideration. 7.14.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.14) on the question - ""In the context of community health worker (CHW) programmes, should practising CHWs mobilize wider community resources for health versus not?"" (238) - identified as eligible for inclusion two studies (one quantitative, one qualitative), conducted in India and the United States."

And if we think about language in present world then English is one of the most used languages in the world and English is used as a second language in Bangladesh. English is introduced here at the primary level and its inclusion continues till the tertiary level of education. Most of the students of the primary schools in rural areas are weak in English language due to lack of skilled and trained teachers who are familiar to the modern methods and approaches of teaching and lack of materials for teaching in the classroom. Primary level English curriculum implementation is essential in Bangladesh to achieve the set English language competency in the rural areas. Students in the rural areas are performing poorly in English compared to their urban counterparts. Statistics showed that there was a gulf of difference between the facilities enjoyed by rural schools and urban schools. The study explores the challenges of teaching English language in rural areas in context of Bangladesh. This study investigated the factors affecting student's performance in English language in rural areas. Data were collected using interviews, classroom observation and questionnaire. Result of the study reveals that students were highly motivated to learn English for future expectations such as local and international communication, academic advancement and employment prospects. It also provide a scenario of English teaching system in rural areas of Bangladesh as well as the problems and prospects of English language in perspective of Bangladesh.

MORE INCLUSIVE LOCAL EDUCATION GROUPS Indicator 19 Existing local coordination mechanisms for the education sector, also called local education groups (LEGs), play a key role in GPE work at the country level.17 LEGs are critical to promote inclusive and participatory process at the plan preparation stage and the plan implementation stage, in particular for sector monitoring. LEGs seek to broaden the participation and diversity of stakeholders working in education. They are government-led and should ideally include representation from all development partners (multilateral and bilateral), CSOs, teacher organizations (TOs), national and international NGOs, CSO coalitions, community groups, indigenous groups, parent-teacher organizations and the private sector. To facilitate measuring progress against this objective, the GPE results framework tracks the inclusion of CSOs and TOs in LEGs 14. This quality standard assesses how inclusive (who is represented) and participatory (effective engagement) the JSR was in bringing together a broad set of stakeholders in joint sector monitoring efforts. 15. Source: GPE Secretariat. Of the 26 JSRs in the 2018 data set, 22 reported INGO participation and four did not specify; 23 reported local CSO participation, one reported no local CSO participation, and two did not specify. The nature of this assessment makes it hard to gauge the nature of CSO participation and understand whether the proceedings of the JSR gave them enough opportunities to bring their views to the table and broaden the dialogue. 16.

As an initial step in working with a national government, Global Footprint Network invites the country to collaboratively review the underlying data in its National Footprint Accounts for accuracy and completeness. This due diligence helps ensure that the Footprint results for that country are valid and reliable, and also increases the reliability and robustness of the Footprint methodology for all nations. The verified national results can then be put to use by the government for a wide variety of purposes, including to: * Create an enhanced understanding of the country's Ecological Footprint and biocapacity. Specifically, this can: * Identify resource constraints and dependencies; * Recognize resource opportunities (e.g. forests). * Explore policy creation to: * Protect national interests and leverage existing opportunities; * Bring the economy in line with global limits, including planning for a low-carbon future; * Further innovation that maintains or improves quality of life while reducing dependence on ecological capacity. * Leverage trade opportunities to: * Create a strong trade position for exports by better understanding who has ecological reserves and who does not, and what the trends are; * Minimize and prioritize external resource needs. * Create a baseline for setting goals and monitoring progress toward lasting and sustainable economic development.

Access to finance is an important constraint , indicated by firm perceptions as well as low levels of capital intensity and high returns to capital .	Access to finance is an important constraint, indicated by firm perceptions as well as low levels of capital intensity and high returns to capital. Table 5.3 shows the cross-sectional variations in capital intensity and returns to capital by firm size in Coted'Ivoire and a set of comparator countries. Capital intensity among Ivorian firms is in fact substantially lower than in other countries. Conversely, the average returns to capital across different firm sizes are almost always higher. While it isdifficult to assess where capital is most binding, we use average return to capital, measured as the ratio of value added over the capital stock, as a proxy. The idea is that for profit-maximizing firms, the marginal returns to capital should be equated to its price, hence higher returns indicate higher capital cost, or that thefirm is more capital constrained. Using this proxy, Ivorian firms appear to be most capital constrained among comparator countries both in West Africa and other regions.

Some technologies are being developed that may help raise land productivity and input-use efficiency in the irrigated ecosystem, and thereby contribute to a further increase in rice supplies. In 1989, IRRI began to design a new rice plant, one that would make it possible to grow an irrigated rice crop with up to 30% higher yield. It is designed to increase nutrient efficiency with fewer, larger panicles per plant, to reduce unproductive tillers, and to increase photosynthesis efficiency through erect and thick leaves. Field evaluations of the breeding lines have been going on for some time with new problems, such as poor grain filling and high incidence of stem borer, being detected. The new plant architecture also needs to be matched with agronomic practices: planting method, nitrogen application, and weed control. It may take a few more years before this technology reaches farmers.

CHAPTER 7 Different countries face different jobs challenges, but their jobs agendas are interconnected by two forces--the migration of people and the migration of jobs. These two flows have consequences for living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in sending and receiving countries. The arrival of migrants or the outsourcing of jobs abroad affects the living standards of both migrants and locals. The availability of foreign workers, the development of migrant networks channeling savings and ideas, and the arrival of multinational firms bringing more advanced techniques are all bound to increase productivity.

Jobs connect people Some jobs bring people into contact with others whom they might not otherwise encounter, including people of different ethnicities and social backgrounds (box 4.6). This connecting aspect of jobs can contribute to social cohesion. Jobs can create opportunities for repeated interactions focused on tasks leading to interdependent relationships.32 A study of political views Jobs (or the lack of jobs) can shape social interactions The link between social cohesion and jobs is not necessarily direct or linear. Interactions between jobs and societies are contextual and multidimensional; effects can be positive as well as negative. Having, or not having, a job can influence how people view themselves in relation to others, with implications for values, attitudes, and behaviors. Jobs can connect people with information, economic activities, and other people. And how jobs are allocated can affect whether people think their society is fair and merit-based, believe they have a stake in society, and have expectations and aspirations for the future (Question 4).

The focus is on features of the agricultural system that are important from a jobs perspective and agricultural subsectors that are particularly promising for inclusive employment, but that have so far received less attention in national employment strategies. This is not to dismiss the important potential of export crops, but these have been discussed extensively elsewhere (WorldBank 2012; 2015).

On this basis , the GDG recommended that , in settings where the health workers operating at the front line of service delivery are CHWs , they should possess a polyvalent profile , enabling them to deliver a range of priority primary health care services .	Adopting an integrated and person-centred approach to primary health care (187), however, requires a health workforce configuration whereby health workers operating as first point of contact of the health system possess a relatively broad set of skills to enable them to better respond to population needs and demands for services, or refer them to the appropriate level of care when they are unable to do so directly. On this basis, the GDG recommended that, in settings where the health workers operating at the front line of service delivery are CHWs, they should possess a polyvalent profile, enabling them to deliver a range of priority primary health care services. Recognizing that some settings may present particular epidemiology situations, cultural contexts or health system requirements, the addition of more specialized CHWs, with clear division of roles vis-a-vis polyvalent CHWs, should be considered when aligned with public policy objectives and instrumental to the attainment of population health goals.	On this basis, the GDG recommended that, in settings where the health workers operating at the front line of service delivery are CHWs, they should possess a polyvalent profile, enabling them to deliver a range of priority primary health care services.

The objective of this analysis was to synthesize current understanding of how CHW programmes can best be designed and operated in health systems. The review team identified 122 reviews (75 systematic reviews, of which 34 were meta-analyses, and 47 non-systematic reviews). CHW programmes included in these reviews were diverse in the interventions provided, selection and training of CHWs, supervision, remuneration and integration into the health system. Features that appeared to enable positive CHW programme outcomes included community embeddedness (whereby community members have a sense of ownership of the programme and positive relationships with the CHWs), supportive supervision, continuous education, adequate logistical support and supplies, and integration with the health system. The review team found gaps in the evidence, including on the rights and needs of CHWs, on effective approaches to training and supervision, on CHWs as community change agents, and on the influence of health system decentralization, social accountability, and governance. While the findings of the systematic review of reviews, having captured evidence from independently commissioned reviews, were typically not specific to the focus of the PICO questions, in several cases they provided useful complementary evidence and contextual information on some of the PICO questions. 6.2 Systematic reviews on the 15 PICO questions The Centre for Evidence and Implementation, in consortium with the University of Melbourne, Campbell Collaboration, International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), University of Toronto, University of Newcastle, University of Sydney, University of Adelaide, University of Iowa, American Institutes for Research and Aga Khan University, was selected through a competitive bidding process to develop the systematic reviews for each of the 15 PICO questions selected by the GDG.

Teaching materials are very important in the whole process of teaching and learning to any subject.

Attitudes refer to the sets of beliefs that the learner holds towards members of the target group and also towards his own culture (Brown, 2000). Language attitude is an important concept because it plays a key role in language learning. In education, attitudes are considered both as input and output. Motivation is the most used concept for explaining failure or success of a learner. Also motivation has been regarded as one of the main factors that influence the speed and amount of success of foreign language learners. (Gardener, 2006). It has been seen that passive learning, lack of adequate materials for teaching, motivation of the students and attitudes towards learning keeping the rural area students inefficient in English language compared to urban students.

To the local governments, China's central government set a few principles on balancing the reopening of businesses and supporting SMEs with epidemic control: First, COVID-19 prevention readiness is a criterion in reopening: Local governments will review business reopening applications, with a focus on assessing whether the business has met the COVID-19 prevention requirements, monitoring the business on its implementation of the disease prevention methods, and helping the business make a plan for emergencies. Second, business reopening is happening in waves. Instead of letting all businesses open at one time, priority is given to the businesses high on the local government's list--for example, Shanghai prioritized businesses that have an impact on city development and daily needs and businesses with large contributions to the area economy. Zhejiang Province gave first priority to its major export industries.

The program focused on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops ( plantain , rice , manioc , rice , maize , mango ) and animal husbandry ( chicken , pork ) .	Mechanization remains limited. As urban and rural wages increase, pressures to mechanize will increase. This does not necessarily imply large-scale farming. Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization. They have been deployed successfully, most recently also in China, where land endowments are multiple times smaller.69 While not acute, the need for supporting smallholder mechanization within Coted'Ivoire and its implications for employment generation in agriculture deserves further investigation. 66 The 2011-2016 regional US$44 million West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), which Coted'Ivoire participates in and which is thefirst phase of a 10-year program, provides an initial step in addressing the staple crop productivity gap. The program focused on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops (plantain, rice, manioc, rice, maize, mango) and animal husbandry (chicken, pork). Regional research centers were set up, each focusing on one crop. The center in Coted'Ivoire focused on plantain. 67 WorldBank (2012a, 2014) provides a useful starting point. 68 Deininger et al.

"A systematic literature review of reported challenges in health-care delivery to migrants and refugees in highincome countries identified three main topics of challenges in health-care delivery: communication, continuity of care and confidence.23 Communication is critical for obvious diagnostic and treatment trajectories. The availability of trained interpreters from migrant communities was described as a key aspect in providing migrant-sensitive care. Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted. Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of the health-care system, integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system. Confidence was the third most common topic mentioned and related to trust in the health-care provider, ensuring cultural sensitivity in care provision and the ability to have agency. Studies indicated that, in cases where no trustful relationship was established, patients resorted to using traditional medicine and trusted ""their own resources"" from their community for treatment. Conversely, a systematic review that investigated the perceptions, attitudes and practices of health providers in the provision of health-care services for migrants found they were challenged not only by language and cultural barriers, but also by resource constraints within their workplaces, and incoherence between professional ethics and domestic laws that limited migrants' right to health care.24 Health-care providers used innovative means to ensure care provision in managing such clinical cases with civil society groups."

These include , beyond better access to finance , other complementary inputs such as business services support , access to information about foreign markets , and public inputs such as quality standards .	In the context of Coted'Ivoire, two factors stand out as possible constraints to output demand growth: transport infrastructure and logistics, and firm capabilities. As in most countries, rapid expansion of demand is most likely to occur in tradable sectors. Coted'Ivoire has an advantage over many other landlocked countries but its logistic performance index (LPI) is barely above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. The cost of export and import based on Doing Business data is inexplicably more expensive than landlocked countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali.105 For smaller firms in particular, reaching the regional market might be an important 104 Doing Business data on Minimum wage/Ratio of minimum wage to value added per employee: Kenya: 269.4/1.4, CI: 119.0/0.5, Senegal: 185.6/1.1, Cameroon: 70.3/0.3, Burkina Faso: 107.9/1, Sri Lanka: 79.3/0.2, Ghana: 60.1/0.3, Mali:62/0.5, Vietnam: 142.5/0.6 105 See http://www.doingbusiness.org/Custom-Query/cote-divoire channel for export. Yet road and rail transport infrastructure in Coted'Ivoire is inefficient and expensive, contributed to by entrenched monopoly, inefficient quota system, and pervasive roadblocks and corruption demands in the north such as along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor (WorldBank 2014, 2015b). Successful demand accumulation also requires a certain degree of firm capabilities. As argued earlier, the fact that Ivorian firms are significantly less able to survive in sectors with a high rate of foreign entry suggests the need to improve capabilities for domestic firms. These include, beyond better access to finance, other complementary inputs such as business services support, access to information about foreign markets, and public inputs such as quality standards. The next section discusses some of the policy tools toward this goal.

Cross-country evidence has convincingly shown that GDP growth in agriculture is more poverty reducing than GDP growth originating outside agriculture.32 This holds especially when it concerns extreme poverty, when most of the poor live in rural areas, earning their living in agriculture,33 and when land is more equally distributed, such that poor smallholders can put both their assets (labor and land) to work, benefit from them directly, and do so in large numbers. These cross-country empirical regularities are confirmed in Asia (for example, China)34 as well as in recent African case studies. For instance, two-thirds of the 4 percentage point reduction in the poverty headcount during 2005-2009 in Uganda could be accounted for by the increase in earnings among individuals who were working primarily in agriculture in 2005 and continued doing so through 2009.35 This followed because a large share of the population stayed in agriculture (49 percent) and many of them were poor, such that even a small drop in their poverty rate corresponded to a large number of people exiting poverty. The bulk of the sharp drop in poverty in Ethiopia during 1996-2011 could similarly be ascribed to growth in the agricultural sector.36 Yet, income generation in agriculture does not always or automatically lead to poverty reduction. In Brazil, for example, growth in agriculture did not contribute much to poverty reduction.37 Land in Brazil is unequally distributed, and its agricultural boom of the past two decades has largely been driven by large-scale, highly mechanized, skill-intensive agriculture (much of it following the development of the Cerrado for soybean exports to China). It highlights that the job-generating and poverty-reducing powers of agriculture are further conditioned by initial conditions (agro-ecological potential and land distribution), production modalities (large versus small scale) and agricultural policies.	In Brazil, for example, growth in agriculture did not contribute much to poverty reduction.37 Land in Brazil is unequally distributed, and its agricultural boom of the past two decades has largely been driven by large-scale, highly mechanized, skill-intensive agriculture (much of it following the development of the Cerrado for soybean exports to China).

The proportion of global cannabis herb seizures that are recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean rose from 20 per cent in 2012 to 30 per cent in 2013. There was a sharp increase of almost 60 per cent in cannabis seizures in South America between 2012 and 2013, from 821 tons to 1,308 tons. Thatincrease was largely driven by seizures in, in descending order of seizure amounts, Paraguay, Colombia and Brazil. 466. While the cannabis seized in Colombia in 2014 was cultivated domestically, the seizures reported by Brazil were of cannabis entering the country from Paraguay. Cannabis is widely consumed in the region, but it is also sometimes trafficked together with cocaine and used as payment for transporting, storage and distribution services along the routes towards North America and Europe. 467. South America continues to be the main source of all cocaine manufactured worldwide, with the cultivation of coca bush and the manufacturing of cocaine and coca paste taking place mainly in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Colombia and Peru. However, the seizure of coca leaf and coca paste, as well as the discovery of clandestine laboratories, in neighbouring countries such as Argentina and Chile suggests that refining also takes place elsewhere in the region. Argentina reported the discovery of 15 clandestine laboratories for refining, tableting, cutting or packaging in 2014, 12 of which were for cocaine. In the same year, Chile reported the discovery of 22 clandestine kitchen laboratories, all of them dedicated to cocaine .

Natural resources such as the atmosphere , water , forests , and soil provide services useful for economic activities and necessary for human life , but they are often overused because their cost from a private point of view falls short of their true social cost .	Policies also try to promote job creation in more environmentally friendly industries. Jobs in enterprises that produce wind mills for electricity generation, construct water and soil conservation systems, and plant and manage trees fall in this category. These are often called green jobs, with different definitions attached to the term. Industries matching the most common definitions of green jobs tend to be relatively small in many developing countries, with Brazil and China notable exceptions (box 5.6).58 Pending a precise quantification of environmental spillovers from jobs, it is likely that the activities with the greatest potential to mitigate adverse environmental damage in develop- for cost efficiency, bringing smaller local companies into the value chain. Contracting out provides opportunities for small and microenterprises to also reap the benefits of knowledge spillovers.52 Research can also shed light on the obstacles preventing the productivity spillovers from globally integrated jobs from materializing. Crosscountry analysis shows that the degree of labor market flexibility, barriers to firm entry, and infrastructure development substantially influence the impact of openness on growth.53 Knowledge spillovers hinge on the ability of the local economy to absorb them--human capital and research and development capacity are important. Local firms need a certain level of production and technological capabilities to be selected as suppliers by foreign companies. When technology gaps between local firms and foreign companies are large, productivity spillovers are less likely to occur.54 Environmental impacts. Jobs that overuse natural resources or damage the environment are less productive than their direct output might suggest. The environmental damage they create imposes a negative spillover on others, resulting in a lower net contribution to aggregate output. Natural resources such as the atmosphere, water, forests, and soil provide services useful for economic activities and necessary for human life, but they are often overused because their cost from a private point of view falls short of their true social cost.55 The emission of greenhouse gases is an example of a negative spillover.

Establish health system monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that can track the outcomes of health system reforms that address barriers to accessing health services for persons with disabilities. In addition, more studies are needed to understand the reasons for poorer self-reported health for persons with disabilities and for their increased morbidity and mortality. Studies are also needed to assess whether these poor health outcomes are linked to underlying health conditions or environmental barriers such as lack of social support or access to health services. For health care and social service planning, it is important to investigate this causation more closely, in particular, more longitudinal research is needed. 63 .

Development, understood as the development of health systems, but also of improved access to water, sanitation and transportation infrastructure, provides the overall context for the burden of disease. While the shiftin the composition of the global health burden towards non-communicable diseases has been achieved in developed regions, communicable diseases, along with maternal, nutritional and neonatal conditions, continue to take a heavy toll in some developing regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania 1 WHO, 1946. And Southern Asia. Universal health coverage, which refers to systems in which all people have access to adequate health care without financial hardship and in an equitable manner, has been instituted in only some developed countries.2 Its prioritization in developing regions is likely to be based on each country's epidemiological conditions, demographics, economic resources and current state of the health system.3 Biology determines the health needs and vulnerabilities specific to women and men. It is one of the main factors behind men's increased risk for a number of health problems, their higher mortality (starting from day one and extending throughout their lives), and their shorter life expectancy. However, medical and technological improvements over several decades are extending the lives of both men and women. In the case of women, maternal and reproductive health needs are increasingly being addressed through improved health systems and the delivery of services.4 For example, complete cover- 2 WHO and World Bank, 2014. 3 Boerma and others, 2014. 4 United Nations, 2014a.

"Following the guideline of "" living well within the means of one planet "" , the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil , and does not moralize ."	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where. This view of the world has proven to be sufficient for raising central questions and sparking the conversations that are needed to reverse current trends.

Countries are making difficult decisions to balance the demands of responding directly to the COVID-19 pandemic with the need to maintain the delivery of other essential health services. Establishing safe and effective patient flow (including screening for COVID-19, triage, and targeted referral) remains critical at all levels. Many routine and elective services have been suspended, and existing delivery approaches are being adapted to the evolving pandemic context as the risk-benefit analysis for any given activity changes. When the delivery of essential health services comes under threat, effective governance and coordination mechanisms, as well as protocols for service prioritisation and adaptation, can mitigate the risk of outright system failure. (c) Maintains 86 As the outbreak is brought under control and restrictive public health measures are gradually eased, some adaptations in service delivery may need to be reversed, others continued for a limited time, and yet others that are found to be effective, safe and beneficial incorporated into routine post-pandemic practice. The course of the outbreak is likely to wax and wane, and the strategic response will need to be dynamic and calibrated. Decision-makers should anticipate the need to start, stop, and restart adaptations. Decisions should be aligned with relevant national and sub-national policies and should be re-evaluated at regular intervals. Successful implementation of these strategic shifts will require the active engagement of communities and public and private stakeholders, specific measures to ensure access for socially vulnerable populations, transparency and frequent communication with the public, and a high degree of cooperation from individuals.

The vocational qualification is acquired at the level of first form and second form, then third and fourth form and specialization after secondary education lasting for one year. In Montenegro: Primary (compulsory) education is extended to nine years. It is extended downwards, children starting primary school one year earlier. More exactly, the children who by the end of the calendar year turn six shall enrol at primary schools. In the future nine-year primary education will be divided into three cycle, each one lasting three years. Secondary education: Instead of the existing High School courses (natural-science; social-language; study of philology and mathematics), a general High School is proposed, where one part of the curriculum would be devoted to a general-educational core and another to elective subjects. Schooling in High Schools lasts for four years, from the age of 15 to 18. The curricula in Serbia and Montenegro are adopted by the Ministers of Education with the prior consent of the Education Councils of both Republics.

Large firms innovate more , but they are Many are located in rural areas , absorbing some labor slack during the low agricultural season ( box 3.3 ) .	The dynamism of microenterprises matters not only for livelihoods but also for productivity growth. Large firms innovate more, but they are Many are located in rural areas, absorbing some labor slack during the low agricultural season (box 3.3). Across 18 developing countries, 44 percent of the people living on less than US$1 a day in urban areas, and 24 percent of those in rural areas, work in a nonagricultural business. On average, they do not earn much.44 Nonetheless, these nonfarm activities provide an important channel to diversify income for the poor. In nine Sub-Saharan African countries, most nonfarm jobs were generated by households starting businesses, rather than entering the rapidly expanding private wage sector. Despite being modest, earnings from household enterprises contribute to consumption much the same as earnings from wage employment do. And these small businesses offer an avenue for poor households to engage in gradually more productive activities.45 While microenterprises have a lackluster performance as a group, they are also very diverse. In middle-income countries, a significant share of the owners of micro-and small enterprises are as entrepreneurial as their peers in industrial countries. Their weak performance may be driven more by contextual factors such as limited access to credit and policy-induced barriers to access technologies and markets, than by limited capacity. In several Latin American countries, for example, entrants into selfemployment tend to be workers who have ac- Microenterprises in urban areas, and particularly those in the informal sector, tend to attract the attention of academics and policy makers. But microenterprises are prominent in rural areas as well. The surveys of micro-and small enterprises in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean show that fewer than half are in cities and towns with 20,000 inhabitants or more. The urban share reaches 46 percent in the Dominican Republic but is below 30 percent in all other countries surveyed. Even if rural towns are counted (generally, localities with 2,000 to 20,000 inhabitants), well over half of the enterprises are in strictly rural areas in most countries.

This also opens up new jobs opportunities , directly in the production of these products ( dairy , meat , fruits , and vegetables ) , and indirectly in the associated chains ( storage , transport , processing , packaging , wholesale , and retail ) .	Fifth, the dietary transformation following income growth and urbanization also opens up new demand for agricultural products and employment on, and increasingly also, offthe farm in the value chains. As countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases. After Engel's Law, this is the second large Law of Demand, named after Bennett. This also opens up new jobs opportunities, directly in the production of these products (dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables), and indirectly in the associated chains (storage, transport, processing, packaging, wholesale, and retail). The production of high-value agricultural products tends to be more labor intensive (see also Figure3.6), while jobs in the agricultural value chain (especially in agro-processing) are often taken up by women (Table 2.2). Together they add better earning and more inclusive jobs, mitigating the decline of jobs in staple crop production as increasing labor productivity in staple production releases labor (given less than unit income elasticity of demand for staples) and the structural transformation proceeds. Linking changes in dietary patterns to the employment structure in six East and Southern African countries, Tschirley et al. (2015) project that between 2010 and 2025 about one-quarter of the decline in the farm labor share (3.2 percentage points out of a decline of 13.2) will be absorbed in food preparation away from home, food manufacturing, and marketing and transport.

This sometimes causes confusion , since it is the same term used in the research domain of entrepreneurial learning , which is about studying how entrepreneurs learn outside of the educational domain .	"9. The two most frequent terms used in this field are enterprise education and entrepreneurship education. The term enterprise education is primarily used in United Kingdom, and has been defined as focusing more broadly on personal development, mindset, skills and abilities, whereas the term entrepreneurship education has been defined to focus more on the specific context of setting up a venture and becoming self-employed (QAA, 2012, Mahieu, 2006). In United States, the only term used is entrepreneurship education (Erkkila, 2000). Some researchers use the longer term enterprise and entrepreneurship education (See for example Hannon, 2005), which is more clear but perhaps a bit unpractical. Sometimes enterprise and entrepreneurship education is discussed by using the term entrepreneurship education only, which however opens up for misunderstanding. Erkkila (2000) has proposed the unifying term entrepreneurial education as encompassing both enterprise and entrepreneurship education. This term will be used extensively in this report to avoid confusion. Further, the word ""student"" will in this report be used for learners on all levels of education, rather than adding the word ""pupil"" that some still use. For an overview of terms, see figure 1. 10. In Northern and Eastern Europe some additional terms are used. In Sweden and the Balkans the term entrepreneurial learning is often used as an equivalent to enterprise education (See for example Leffler and Falk-Lundqvist, 2013, Heder et al., 2011). This sometimes causes confusion, since it is the same term used in the research domain of entrepreneurial learning, which is about studying how entrepreneurs learn outside of the educational domain. Another set of terms used in Finland is internal entrepreneurship education and external entrepreneurship education (See for example Seikkula-Leino et al., 2010). Internal entrepreneurship education is a synonym to enterprise education, and external entrepreneurship education is a synonym to entrepreneurship education. Adding to the confusion here is the fact that internal entrepreneurship is sometimes used as a synonym to intrapreneurship, i.e. when acting entrepreneurially in an established organization (See for example Burgelman, 1983). 9 ."

The IGS State of Governance Report provides a vivid example: According to the law, based on the 13 amendment of the Constitution, the immediate past Chief Justice will be the head of the interim Caretaker Government. This has created strong incentives for the Government to nominate judges to the Appellate Division who were perceived to be loyal to the government, since Chief Justices are selected from among Appellate Division judges.18 The Business Anti-Corruption portal highlights that business-to-business corruption is not illegal, that lawsuits and commercial disputes are often delayed and parties are subsequently encouraged to pay 'speed money' in order to obtain a ruling. Companies involved in legal disputes generally try to avoid the lower courts due to the high frequency of corruption at this judicial level.19 Corruption in the police force is widespread. In their most recent household survey, TIB found that the majority of households had to pay bribes when lodging first information reports at police stations, when registering general diaries and when requesting clearance certificates.20 In the absence of any strong accountability mechanisms, incentives are strong for police officers to continue with corrupt practices.

Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries .	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study.

How can you make the case that managing resource demand is core to securing human well-being? What kind of counterarguments might they throw back at you (ministers for health, economy, energy, foreign affairs, or defense)? If you accept ecological constraints, then, logically, every population, whether for a project, a region or a country, has to determine for itself what its ideal or optimal resource consumption is. Too low of a consumption rate can lead to inadequate food, shelter and health services. Too high of a consumption rate can put the population at risk since ecological deficits in a world with significant ecological overshoot will become an increasing liability to economies.

Product development : Two high-protein baked snacks from defatted peanut flour were developed and tested in the U.S. and Senegal : ( 1 ) cookies , and ( 2 ) chin-chin ( a West African snack ) .	Use of technologies adaptable/appropriate to Senegal include local clays, UV light for aflatoxin detoxification by cottage level peanut processors, peanut milk and protein isolates for protein deficient children, and fish by-products used to produce high protein peanut-based snacks. Peanut-based fish nuggets could enable recovery of fish by-products in Senegal and the U.S., where fishing industries are strong, and add value thereby enhancing both the fish and peanut industries. Product development: Two high-protein baked snacks from defatted peanut flour were developed and tested in the U.S. and Senegal: (1) cookies, and (2) chin-chin (a West African snack). Substitution of up to 40% roasted defatted peanut flour yielded snacks that was most acceptable to consumers. U.S. and West African sensory panels tested both snacks; the West African panel gave higher acceptability ratings to peanut-based snacks especially chin-chin compared to the U.S. panel. Shelf-life of chin-chin was determined to be good. The high protein-low fat products have health implications. Peanut milk from defatted peanut flour is being developed in Senegal by collaborating researchers for testing for acceptance by Senegalese consumers. Assessment of the level of aflatoxin contamination in peanuts and peanut products in Senegal, through sampling, was carried out. The results provided baseline on health risks to consumers and provide guidance on ways to reduce aflatoxin especially at the village/small-scale processor level. Aflatoxin detoxification: B1 and G1 Aflatoxin detoxification of peanut products using Senegalese Attapulgite clay was tested in Senegal in collaboration with NCA&T researchers. Addition of clay as low as 0.5% level resulted to non-detectable levels of aflatoxin in all samples. Samples of all peanut products in local markets in Senegal showed aflatoxin contamination; the products showing high levels of over 30% were: crude peanut oil (92%), peanut cake (90%), and peanut paste (55%), and kernels in local market (30%). Sorting and removal of skins proved effective in lowering aflatoxin for some uses, and the utilization of the Senegalese attapulgite clay reduced aflatoxin to none detectable levels in other uses of peanut.

"The Australian Crime Commission indicated that a seizure of almost two tons made in November 2014 was indicative of the resurgence of the "" ecstasy "" market in both the country and the region ."	"96 INCB REPORT 2015 action plan"", which has helped to improve resource targeting and thereby to gather more accurate data on methamphetamine abuse and trafficking. The increase in smuggling of small amounts of methamphetamine in 2014 may have occurred in response to increased law enforcement pressure on the diversion of precursors and on clandestine laboratories. 749. The Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority has emphasized the role of joint regional operations in large methamphetamine seizures. For example, in July 2015, a sea container sent from South America to Fiji contained 80 kg of methamphetamine and was intercepted in a joint operation of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. 750. The Australian Crime Commission has also determined that, of all drug types, methamphetamine poses the greatest threat to the Australian public because of its increasing purity and the involvement of organized criminal groups. In its 2013/14 report, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service asserted that seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants had increased by nearly 19per cent from the previous year. Most of the amphetamine-type stimulants were detected in cargo and in postal consignments. In the 2014/15 reporting period, the Service maintained its focus on detecting and seizing amphetamine-type stimulants in postal consignments, while the country's law enforcement authorities expressed concern about the potential for transnational organized criminal groups to exploit the market for synthetic drugs. 751. In 2014, law enforcement authorities in Australia reported ""ecstasy"" seizures of several tons each. The Australian Crime Commission indicated that a seizure of almost two tons made in November 2014 was indicative of the resurgence of the ""ecstasy"" market in both the country and the region. The Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System reported that in 2014 the availability of ""ecstasy"" pills, powder, and capsules appeared to have increased significantly from 2013. In 2013, amphetaminetype stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, were the most detected drug at the Australian border."

In Haiti, the F2F IP stated that the main challenges to safe use of pesticides are that DDT (or a product called DDT) is still being sold; and that most of the pesticide markets are far from farms. This means they must buy the product and bring it home in the same bag as they bring other goods home. Also, farmers often do not know what they are using, they just go to the store ask for a treatment for aphids and the store owner or vendor gives them what ever is available. Another issue is that pesticides are often stored near food for humans or animals or near water sources.

India was the pioneer, but other countries--Brazil, Chile, China, and Malaysia, to name a few--have also seized the opportunity.72 The obvious winners of job migration are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered service jobs have migrated. This migration, along with the transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and higher living standards. The hidden winners of job migration are consumers worldwide. The improved international division of labor increases the availability of goods and services and enhances the possibility of gaining from trade. The clear losers are those who have seen their jobs disappear because of the declining competitiveness of their industries and services. Among the losers, many skilled workers find comparable jobs without a substantial loss in salary, but oth- and expertise. Social effects are more mixed. On the positive side, migration connects people from different cultures in ways bound to widen their horizons. On the negative side, the separation from family and friends can be a source of distress and isolation. Migration may also bring racial prejudice and heighten social tensions in host countries, especially when migrants are secluded in segregated occupations or neighborhoods, preventing their integration in society.

While, ideally, protected areas established to conserve inland water ecosystems will encompass entire catchments, more typically innovative combinations of protected areas and other strategies will need to be applied within an IRBM framework. Existing protected areas designated and designed to protect terrestrial ecosystems no doubt confer some benefits to wetland biodiversity through landscape management, but there are significant opportunities to provide enhanced protection. Designs for new protected areas can and should include inland water considerations from the outset to achieve better integration. The following pages provide introductory guidelines for how the range of different management approaches in protected areas represented by the categories can better assist inland wetland conservation.

Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.	Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high.

There is a very strong correlation between the rural/urban parity index for learning in early grades (grade 2 or 3) and at the end of primary education (grade 6).b In other words, countries with huge disparities in early grades are rarely able to make up their lost ground later on. a. While some studies demonstrate that learning mathematics does not necessarily require reading skills, a vast majority of research findings show that reading is key to learning mathematics (G. Fite, ""Reading and Math: What Is the Connection?""; H. Korpershoek, H. Kuyper, and G. Van Der Werf, ""The relation between students' math and reading ability and their mathematics, physics, and chemistry examination grades in secondary education""). b.

Across the 10 countries with PASEC data, 45 percent of the schools were underperforming with fewer than 20 percent of their students achieving minimum proficiency level, while in other schools the majority of students achieved minimum proficiency levels (see Appendix F). The degree of variance between schools differs across countries. For example, in Chad and Niger more than 80 percent of schools are underperforming, while this figure is only 1 percent in Burundi. The vast majority (88.7 percent) of the underperforming schools are located in rural areas, and a majority (53.1 percent) of the students in these underperforming schools come from the poorest 40 percent households."

Another approach is the mass communication of ""simple rules"" to farmers. A campaign to encourage farmers to experiment in eliminating early season insecticide applications has been very successful in Vietnam and is now being attempted in Thailand. The campaign used billboards, cartoon characters, information handouts, and humorous radio programs; it reduced rice farmers' insecticide use by an estimated 70% and the proportion of farmers believing that insecticides bring higher yields fell from more than 80% to just 13%."

Weakness: The impact study involving social scientists and economists from NCSU enabled the evaluation of the impact of the food technology PCRSP initiatives in the Philippines. This experience showed the need for more multi-disciplinary inputs, especially in the socio-economic aspects, and should be available as early as the planning and design stage, to ensure that benchmark information is collected using the agreed key performance indicators. Because of this weakness, the impact study could only use post-scenario analysis. Strengths: The scientific expertise, experiences, and dedication of both the US and Philippine partners are commendable and have been critical in the success of PCRSP initiatives in the Philippines. The institutional arrangements for research backstopping, and strong linkages with the private food industry, contributed to the significant achievements of the project.

Inland valleys have a key role to play in providing options for sustainable intensification and diversification of agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Soils in lowland ecosystems are the least fragile and best able to support continuous cultivation. The soils in many valley bottoms retain residual moisture well after an initial flooded rice crop, permitting two crops per year, or aquaculture when base flow lasts long enough. The hydromorphic fringes and upland slopes and crests offer potential for other food and cash crops, and for trees and livestock.

Education influences access to employment opportunities. Education contributes both to the occupations where individuals work, as well as the productivity in these occupations. Patterns of occupational selection are rather strong in Coted'Ivoire. Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agriculture, and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary education or more. The share of nonagricultural self-employment is relatively stable across levels of education, although it slightly decreases at secondary levels and above (Figure1.10). Education is a key determinant of access to certain types of job. As such, stronger gender differences in educational attainment contribute to the strong gender differences in occupation. Box 1.4 further describes the likelihood of employment in the main types of employment given individual characteristics (gender, education) while controlling for other situational factors (social origin, region of residence). Results show that the descriptive patterns of occupational selection by educational level are strong.

The 2017 law , despite limitations , was a sign of progress in the fight against online piracy in Ukraine .	Ukraine remained on the Priority Watch List in the annual Special 301 Report in 2018. This designation reflects the continuing need to address the inadequate protection and enforcement of IPR and remedy the related market access barriers to U.S. exports and investment. Ukraine has taken several positive steps to improve the protection and enforcement of IPR. For example, in 2017, it enacted a law, On State Support of Cinematography, to address prominent online marketplaces facilitating piracy and counterfeiting that continue to be hosted in, or operated from, Ukraine. The 2017 law, despite limitations, was a sign of progress in the fight against online piracy in Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine has engaged in enforcement actions in the last two years aimed at combatting online piracy. Due to concerns that Ukraine was not providing adequate and effective protection of IPR and, in particular, the unfair and nontransparent administration of collective management organizations (CMOs) in Ukraine, the United States suspended a portion of Ukraine's GSP benefits in April 2018. Ukraine subsequently adopted a law in July 2018 to reform its CMO system. While the law is an improvement, it fails to remedy many shortcomings in the previous CMO system, including concerns about the governance of CMOs, the method for calculating royalty rates, payment of royalties for cable retransmissions, risk of overlapping CMOs, and the accreditation procedures to establish a CMO. Draft laws pertaining to patents and geographical indications (GIs) are also of concern. Industry has raised concerns with the introduction of draft patent legislation containing provisions on compulsory licensing and restrictive patentability criteria particularly. The draft legislation on GIs falls short on transparency and adequate safeguards for generic terms and prior trademarks. Finally, concerns with the widespread use of unlicensed software by the Ukrainian government remain, but a recently adopted Cabinet of Ministers resolution requiring government agencies to stop using unlicensed software by the end of 2019 appears promising. The U.S. Government continues to press Ukraine to improve all aspects of its protection and enforcement of IPR.

Ramsar Convention The Ramsar Convention encourages Parties to designate and manage important wetlands in a way that does not change their ecological character .	"Ramsar Convention The Ramsar Convention encourages Parties to designate and manage important wetlands in a way that does not change their ecological character. The 158 Contracting Parties (Governments) have committed themselves to the ""wise use"" of all wetlands on their territory (including rivers), conservation of ""wetlands of international importance"" (Ramsar sites), and international cooperation. Parties each commit to undertaking an inventory of their wetlands and preparing a ""strategic framework for the Ramsar list"" for the systematic and representative national designation and management of wetland habitat types. The Convention has many benefits for wetland conservation since it creates moral pressure for member governments to establish and manage wetland protected areas; sets standards, provides guidance, and facilitates collaboration on wise use; it has a triennial global reporting and monitoring system; and encourages participation of NGOs, local communities and indigenous peoples."

Some farmers have started producing rice through organic farming to meet this demand .	In spite of substantial farm subsidies and price support provided by the government, rice farming cannot compete with other economic activities, and income from it is lower than nonagricultural earnings. Farming operations have been fully mechanized. Nearly all rice seedlings are transplanted using mechanical transplanters. Despite this mechanization, production costs are many times higher than in tropical Asia because of exorbitant land prices and the high opportunity cost of farm labor. Young people are not interested in rice cultivation, which today is carried out mainly by older people. Many Japanese consumers now want environment-friendly rice grown without heavy use of agrochemicals. Some farmers have started producing rice through organic farming to meet this demand.

Digital connectivity has been bolstered by a growing number of individuals using the internet and mobile internet subscriptions , meaning more economies are now in a position to leverage the growing list of digital T & T services .	Results Overview As has been an ongoing trend over the last four years, T&T competitiveness continues to improve worldwide, and connectivity enabling--and enabled by--the industry remains on an upward path. The TTCI 2019 results show that air transportation, digital connectivity and international openness are advancing in a global context of growing trade tensions and nationalism. Air transport infrastructure improvements show a noticeable increase on route capacity and the number of airlines providing services in individual countries. International openness is progressing, with lower-income economies leading the way. Digital connectivity has been bolstered by a growing number of individuals using the internet and mobile internet subscriptions, meaning more economies are now in a position to leverage the growing list of digital T&T services. Travel has also become, for the most part, less expensive and safer, with the Price Competitiveness pillar, for example, showing the greatest percentage increase since 2017. Lastly, T&T is increasingly being prioritized by stakeholders around the world as measured by more favourable perceptions of government prioritization, increased industry funding and more effective marketing campaigns.

It should be remembered that many countries have legislation setting out clearly the criteria under which different types of protected areas are identified: these may or may not equate with the IUCN categories. In the latter case, countries that want to list their protected areas correctly on the WDPA need to work out the relationship between their own classification system and the IUCN categories - many have already done so. In other cases governments have taken the IUCN categories and further refined them for the specific conditions in the country. As long as the refining process does not undermine the basic principles of a protected area or of specific categories, IUCN encourages such a process.

Challenges include transitioning to distance learning due to limited student access to suitable digital learning devices and limited availability of reliable broadband connection. Asia Initiatives is addressing this challenge by raising funds to provide devices and data cards for Internet connectivity. Additionally, to leverage a pool of skilled volunteers and mentors to be trained at short notice. The challenge is further compounded by the linguistic and cultural diversity of different regions of India where these schools are located. They are exploring local and multi-sector partnerships to support the existing project and help expand their reach - both long and short term. Short-term needs include: volunteers to impart training skills to the teachers and field staff, leveraging support of the parents through raising awareness and encouraging parental engagement. Long-term: acquiring low-cost digital devices to ensure continuity of learning, reconfiguring lessons to individualized learning and nutritional requirements for the students. The SoCCs Buddies model is based on a low cost approach to imparting education and it's replicability and flexibility ensures that it is sustainable. The concept of SoCCs is to develop a sustainable non-financial currency - an alternative reward model to encourage social bonding within communities and across the world for the common good of all.

The App is easy to use both for the teachers and students, to schedule the lessons and keep track of the SoCCs points earned and redeemed.

Li and Rama ( 2015 ) provide an overview of job creation and job destruction rates for developing countries .	Net changes in employment hide a considerable amount of job creation and destruction. Cross-country evidence (such as Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta 2009) has found a high degree of employment turbulence in both developed and developing countries, indicated by simultaneously large gross job creation and destruction. To understand the role of business entry and exit in job creation, we decompose aggregate employment growth into job creation (by new and expanding firms) and job destruction (by contracting and existing firms).96 Coted'Ivoire exhibits a very high level of job churning driven by firm entry and exit, even compared to other low-income countries. In 2007-2010 the total job creation and destruction rates in Coted'Ivoire were around 25 percent and 20 percent of total employment, respectively. For the United States (1980-2009) these figures are around 15 percent. Li and Rama (2015) provide an overview of job creation and job destruction rates for developing countries. All countries with available data exhibit gross job creation and destructions below 18 percent, much lower than Coted'Ivoire. For example, Ethiopia's (1997-2007) gross job creation and destruction rates are about 17 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

Finally , improving rural land tenure security and overcoming financing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses .	Several policy entry points can be considered to maximize agriculture's contribution to the jobs agenda in Coted'Ivoire. First, continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Second, smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation, in particular as there are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones. There is substantial scope for modernization to take place in smallholder agriculture, including through mechanization. Third, Coted'Ivoire would need strong additional investments in agricultural research and development, including on staple crops. Fourth, low educational levels and poor training among actors in agricultural value chains hold technological innovation back. Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities. Finally, improving rural land tenure security and overcoming financing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses. This will often require a more integrated value chain approach where the government can play an important coordinating role.

LHL is built upon the premise that humanitarian action , whenever possible , should be led by local and national humanitarian actors rather than international organizations ( Oxfam 2017 ) .	This report examines women's leadership in locally led humanitarian action, specifically local humanitarian leadership (LHL), with case studies from Bangladesh and South Sudan. LHL is built upon the premise that humanitarian action, whenever possible, should be led by local and national humanitarian actors rather than international organizations (Oxfam 2017). The guiding assumption of LHL is that the current humanitarian system has failed to adequately deliver aid to populations in crisis, raising the need for another model of response. This new model involves shifting power and resources to local and national actors because they are well positioned to act fast in emergencies and are likely more aware of the needs and preferences of the local populations than those from the international community (Gingerich and Cohen 2015). Efforts to spur this shift toward LHL have notably been captured in events such as the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in 2016, which gave rise to the Grand Bargain, an agreement between the biggest donors and humanitarian agencies to give 25 percent of their funding to local and national actors, as well as to the Charter for Change, an initiative by 29 international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) that commits them to change how they work with local actors (Charter for Change n.d.).

It ranges, on the one hand, from formal pre-primary education, which is integrated into the national education system via kindergartens where care, play and education are all included, to more informal and often home-based activities.

Travel has also become , for the most part , less expensive and safer , with the Price Competitiveness pillar , for example , showing the greatest percentage increase since 2017 .	Results Overview As has been an ongoing trend over the last four years, T&T competitiveness continues to improve worldwide, and connectivity enabling--and enabled by--the industry remains on an upward path. The TTCI 2019 results show that air transportation, digital connectivity and international openness are advancing in a global context of growing trade tensions and nationalism. Air transport infrastructure improvements show a noticeable increase on route capacity and the number of airlines providing services in individual countries. International openness is progressing, with lower-income economies leading the way. Digital connectivity has been bolstered by a growing number of individuals using the internet and mobile internet subscriptions, meaning more economies are now in a position to leverage the growing list of digital T&T services. Travel has also become, for the most part, less expensive and safer, with the Price Competitiveness pillar, for example, showing the greatest percentage increase since 2017. Lastly, T&T is increasingly being prioritized by stakeholders around the world as measured by more favourable perceptions of government prioritization, increased industry funding and more effective marketing campaigns.

The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country. We measure the level of tourism service infrastructure through the number of hotel rooms complemented by the extent of access to services such as car rentals and ATMs.	The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10.

Research findings are produced for , and disseminated to , different target audiences .	"Ideally, researchers create new knowledge that is supported by strong evidence and is useful for others. Research findings are produced for, and disseminated to, different target audiences. Traditional academic work can be highly technical and narrowly focused, although academic researchers are increasingly encouraged to disseminate their work beyond academic spheres.8 Researchers analysing policy-relevant issues are often keen to engage with policymakers to impart knowledge that can inform policy deliberations and help shape policymaking - this is especially the case with migration. Effective research contributions for policy audiences tend to take the form of short papers and blog articles, as well as policy workshops and interactive expert meetings. 6 GreyNet International, 2014. 7 In order to ensure, to the extent possible, that this chapter provides a comprehensive ""stand-alone"" overview of migration research and analysis in 2017 and 2018, we have drawn upon key background and context material included in the World Migration Report 2018 (chapter 4). 8 McAuliffe, 2016. 127WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 In academia, the main focus is on publishing, with some forms (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than others. A key strength of academic publications is that they have usually been peer reviewed by experts in the field, which typically enhances their quality. The growing number of publishing outlets is, however, characterized by a wide range of peer review standards. Arguably, one of the weaknesses of academic research is that the pressure to publish has contributed to a large increase in academic output in recent years, not always of high-quality material.

Prepare in advance to make your trip smoother and more productive. * Schedule meetings before leaving the United States. Determine whether an interpreter will be required and, if so, make all necessary arrangements before arriving. Business language is generally more technical than the conversational speech that many travelers can handle--and mistakes can be costly. The U.S. Commercial Service can assist in locating qualified translators. * Prepare new business cards in as many languages and sizes as necessary. In most countries, exchanging business cards at the first meeting is considered good business manners. As a matter of courtesy, it is best to carry business cards printed both in English and, if applicable, in the language of the country being visited. * Prepare for different weather conditions. Seasonal weather conditions in the countries being visited are likely to be different from conditions in the United States. * Address health care issues. Plan appropriately with respect to prescription drugs, health insurance, vaccinations, and other matters, including dietary needs and preferences. * Find out about the electrical current in each of your destinations. A transformer, plug adapter, or both may be needed to demonstrate company products, as well as your own electronics--such as laptops or tablets for presentations. * Think about money. U.S. banks can provide a list of automatic teller machines overseas, exchange rates, and traveler's checks. * Consider transportation. Be aware of public and private transportation available in each country you'll be visiting and have a plan for getting around. Arrange as many needs as possible (e.g., hiring a driver) before you arrive. * Prepare for differences in culture.

Every year, global footprint network calculates this ""Earth Overshoot Day."" In 2010, Earth Overshoot Day occurred on August 21st, which means that from January 1, 2010 until August 21st, humanity demanded as much biocapacity - food, energy, waste absorption - as the Earth supplied during the whole of 2010. Earth Overshoot Day tends to take place earlier each year due to global population growth and rising resource consumption. Thus we are accumulating an ecological debt. Currently each person on Earth demands an average of a 2.7 gha Footprint, as compared to the biocapacity of 2.1 gha which are available per person. If all humans were to live like Europeans, we would need more than two Earths; at US-American consumption levels we would need almost five. The problem: we have only this, single planet. Somehow we must learn to live within our budget. Footprint calculations estimate that humanity moved into ecological overshoot in the 1980's or earlier. The last century was an era of We have just learned that human resource consumption was once within the limits of what the planet could provide, at least in our grandparents' days.

"Guidelines for applying protected area management categories Issues for consideration * Being a relatively flexible model, category V may sometimes offer conservation options where more strictly protected areas are not feasible. * Category V protected areas can seek to maintain current practices, restore historical management systems or, perhaps most commonly, maintain key landscape values whilst accommodating contemporary development and change: decisions about this need to be made in management plans. * The emphasis on interactions of people and nature over time raises the conceptual question for any individual category V protected area: at what point on the temporal continuum should management focus? And, in an area established to protect values based on traditional management systems, what happens when traditions change or are lost? * Since social, economic and conservation considerations are all integral to the category V concept, defining measures of performance for all of these values is important in measuring success. * As people are the stewards of the landscape or seascape in category V protected areas, clear guidelines are needed about the extent to which decision making can be left to local inhabitants and how far a wider public interest should prevail when there is conflict between local and national needs. * How is category V distinguished from sustainable management in the wider landscape? As an area with exceptional values? As an example of best practice in management? Category V is perhaps the most quickly developing of any protected area management approaches. * There are still only a few examples of the application of category V in coastal and marine settings where a ""protected seascape"" approach could be the most appropriate management option and more examples are needed (see e.g., Holdaway undated)."

Different jobs require different combinations of manual skills (needed for physical tasks), cognitive skills (needed for mental tasks), and social skills (needed to interact with others). The distribution of employment by occupation can be used to estimate the skill intensity of production. As incomes rise, countries tend to use fewer manual skills in production, and more nonroutine cognitive skills. 36 However, even for a given level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, countries can use nonroutine skills to varying degrees (figure 1.6).37 Technological progress expands the possibilities for emerging and even low-income countries to create jobs in higher-skilled production activities as well as to link to international value chains in services and manufacturing. In other words, technological progress enables countries to diverge from a linear evolutionary path from manual skill intensity to the use of higher-order cognitive and social skills.38 India and China top the list of countries in an index measuring their F I G U R E 1. 5 Labor productivity remains low in developing countries Source: World Development Indicators.

Similarly, completion of lower secondary education was relatively high in Latin America and the Caribbean and Western Asia, where several countries reported graduation ratios close to or above 80 per cent. On the other hand, in sub-Saharan Africa, graduation ratios were lower than 40 per cent in nearly three quarters of countries with available data (figure 3.9).

Each of these countries faced a different jobs challenge , so their policy choices are relevant for other countries confronted with similar jobs agendas .	Diverse jobs agendas, diverse policy priorities Following a protocol to identify constraints to the creation of good jobs for development, and then remove or offset them, may sound abstract. But some countries have successfully done this in practice, and it is possible to learn directly from their experiences (box 9.2). The stories of Vietnam, Rwanda, Chile, and Slovenia, show that policy can effectively support the creation of jobs with high development payoffs. Each of these countries faced a different jobs challenge, so their policy choices are relevant for other countries confronted with similar jobs agendas. Getting the fundamentals right by ensuring macroeconomic stability, improving the business environment, and adhering to the rule of law, featured prominently in all four cases. All four countries also embraced labor policies and institutions within a reasonable range. But it is telling that the main constraints they targeted were not in the labor market.

Dr. Nelly Bencheva has undertaken an economic analysis of peanut production in Bulgaria .	Dr. Nelly Bencheva has undertaken an economic analysis of peanut production in Bulgaria. The economic analysis, based on a questionnaire approach sent to farmers and through one-to-one interviews, has collected a lot of information (e.g., yields of peanut varieties being cultivated, size of cultivated areas, age distribution of farmers, etc). While some conclusions were self-evident, a more detailed analysis was going to be undertaken when new statistical tools were provided (including training) from collaboration with the U.S. Principal Investigator (Dr. Curtis Jolly). The EEP member was very impressed with the amount of information that had been rigorously collected and this economic analysis will be essential in terms of feeding into development of the Business Plan (intended to assist investors in developing an economically viable plan to commercialize peanut production). In general terms, the economic analysis showed that current peanut production was now only carried out in very small farms mainly for own consumption rather than for the market place. Production was inefficient (low yields), there was little scope for mechanization and there was a move to the use of 'own seeds or farmer saved seeds' rather than certified varieties. These changes were a result of the break-up of collective farms from Soviet times and it was difficult to see how this could be reversed as small farms were now in private ownership. It seemed very clear that if there was 'market pull' in terms of increased demand from the Bulgarian domestic market or the European Union, it could not be satisfied from domestic production using existing practices. It might be more feasible to establish Related Project AUB30S - 150 - new commercial peanut production in Bulgaria to deliver efficient and cost beneficial supply than to attempt to reverse the changes that are effectively 'fait accompli'. Peanut production in Bulgaria, as a supply route to the European Union, has the potential competitive advantage of delivering products that are aflatoxin-free compared to other parts of the world, and may be able to produce 'organic peanuts' for which there may be a niche market in the European Union and for which Bulgaria is uniquely able to deliver.

Between 1908 and 2000 , crops such as tobacco and maize replaced 74 % of forest cover ( 2.8 million ha ) in eastern Tanzania ( 66 ) .	Tobacco production and greenhouse gases Indirect effects of tobacco production include greenhouse gas emissions related to deforestation and the change to agricultural land use (10). Between 1908 and 2000, crops such as tobacco and maize replaced 74% of forest cover (2.8 million ha) in eastern Tanzania (66). In Zimbabwe and other major tobacco-growing countries, notably China, a growing trend among some farmers to use coal instead of wood for curing has helped limit deforestation but does nothing to alleviate climate change problems (34). 8/ To b a c c o a n d i t s e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t : a n o v e r v i e w Overall, tobacco cultivation and curing are part of one of the most environmentally destructive agricultural practices in low-and middle-income countries (62, 67). Yet production in many of these countries has increased over time. Although tobacco growing may bring some economic benefits to farmers and local communities, these are offset by adverse environmental and economic impacts associated with loss of precious resources such as forests, plants and animal species, and ill health among farmers handling chemicals involved in the process. Due to shifts in production and land availability, this impact increasingly falls on low-and middle-income countries. Worst of all, the majority of these developments are largely irreversible.

Knowledge of these proximal factors is important for targeting within agricultural development policy ensuring the resilience of vulnerable groups of farmers is bolstered .	"In order to implement agricultural development policy in deltas that builds farmer resilience, we first need to be able to assess the conditions that create resilience. Increasingly, it is recognized that resilience assessments have two essential components. The first identifies the characteristics of farmers that explain heterogeneous responses to shocks (Carter et al. 2007, Hoddinott and Quisumbing 2010). The second identifies the social, economic, and institutional factors that create feedbacks reproducing this differential response capacity (Bahadur et al. 2013, Bene et al. 2016a). The first of these assessment components identifies ""proximal"" factors that affect or predict the resilience of rice farmers to climate hazards.

Land explicitly set aside to uptake carbon dioxide emissions could also be measured within the National Footprint Accounts and would provide a regulating ecosystem service.	Human well-being requires, in part, the material consumption of provisioning services provided by the ecosystem.

When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.

In each country, enumerators worked with local leaders in two villages to purposefully select a total of 14 women and 6 men (20 per country) to be case study participants. Selection was split between women and men who were perceived to have high, medium, and low empowerment levels in agriculture. In total, 60 case study narratives were collected and transcribed into English with accompanying photographs and, in some cases, video footage. The pilot (or quantitative) portions of their data were entered and scored in the same way as the pilot data. These individuals' scores were checked to see whether they agreed with the general narrative and local perceptions (self-perceptions and perceptions of local leaders) of a person's empowerment. However, these data were not used in the computation of the WEAI results for each country.

Just when things were at their bleakest people started pulling bikes down from garage rafters and riding them to save money .	"The Company Shane Cooper is president of DeFeet International, a maker of socks for cyclists. Over the years and despite substantial adversity, he has built the business that now includes distributors in 35 countries. He and his wife were bike racers back in the early 1990s. During summers, she was supplementing her income by racing bikes as an amateur and, as Cooper puts it, he was spending her supplemental income as an amateur on his bike racing. His father was a sock knitting machine technician and sold the machine's parts. One day, Cooper the younger decided to make socks to pay for his bike racing hobby. ""It just kind of happened from there,"" he recalls. ""We made the world's best sock for cycling and that was 20 years ago."" The Challenge Cooper's factory burned to the ground in 2006. There was no production for 9 months. Luckily, there was insurance, but it took a lawsuit and 3 years to receive everything owed. And so when he finally got the check, he had to pay taxes out of that money because it's considered business income. ""We had 7 years where we made no money after the fire,"" said Cooper. ""We became profitable again and started winning the business back."" That was just in time for the great recession of 2008. Just when things were at their bleakest people started pulling bikes down from garage rafters and riding them to save money. Bicycle shops became flush with cash, and the Euro soared against the dollar. ""So all of a sudden, after 7 years of struggling, we made it through. And now, we're 4 years in with profits again.

Strengthen regulation of tobacco agriculture to prevent deforestation and land degradation .	This overview has presented evidence to support the case that tobacco is causing massive harm to the environment. It recommends the following: 1. Identify, prevent, treat, and monitor health effects related to tobacco growing and manufacturing among farmers and workers. 2. Make it mandatory for tobacco manufacturers to supply timely and regular information and data on the environmental and health risks of tobacco throughout production and distribution. 3. Establish a collaborative effort to a) evaluate the types and extent of harm to the environment from tobacco throughout its life cycle in relation to WHO FCTC Articles 17, 18, and others; and b) present the evidence on these issues to advocates and Member States within the context of the WHO FCTC, the SDGs, and other international policy frameworks. 4. Develop strategies to free tobacco farmers, and their children, from unsafe agricultural and labour-related practices involving exposure to tobacco pesticides or other chemicals, in relation to WHO FCTC Article 17. 5. Strengthen regulation of tobacco agriculture to prevent deforestation and land degradation. 6. Adopt and implement Extended Producer Responsibility regulations requiring tobacco producers to finance independently established and managed stewardship organizations to prevent, reduce and mitigate tobacco product waste, as well as other life cycle stages of tobacco, where possible. 7. Extend regulations and tax policy on tobacco products and sales to eliminate single-use filters - including any biodegradable varieties - to reduce post-consumption waste. 8. Engage litigation, legislative, and other economic interventions to recover the costs of tobacco industry misconduct and environmental damage. 9. Innovate, improve and enforce new and existing environmental regulations and agreements that may apply to tobacco manufacturing, transport, consumption and post-consumption waste. 10.

We started the literature review by looking at academic and gray literature exploring the link between women's leadership and locally led humanitarian action, but we extended it to humanitarian action in general because the initial area of research did not result in many reports and articles. The case studies were conducted using qualitative methods in partnership with women's organizations from the two countries.3 Researchers carried out semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) for the case studies. Most of the interviews and FGDs were conducted from January to March 2019. The research partners mapped the different local and national actors involved in humanitarian action, with a focus on women leaders and women's organizations. The interviews and FGDs were held with a sample of groups that included members of local humanitarian organizations, as well as women leaders, gender experts, and women's organizations at the national and local governmental and nongovernmental levels.

In some ways, Brazil is an unlikely ""formalizer""--it has a heavily regulated business sector and a costly labor system. Although its rapid formalization is too recent to be fully explained yet, it appears efforts to simplify and extend the reach of programs and regulations have been contributing factors.

Distinguishing features Category IV protected areas usually help to protect, or restore: 1) flora species of international, national or local importance; 2) fauna species of international, national or local importance including resident or migratory fauna; and/or 3) habitats. The size of the area varies but can often be relatively small; this is however not a distinguishing feature. Management will differ depending on need. Protection may be sufficient to maintain particular habitats and/or species. However, as category IV protected areas often include fragments of an ecosystem, these areas may not be self-sustaining and will require regular and active management interventions to ensure the survival of specific habitats and/or to meet the requirements of particular species. A number of approaches are suitable: * Protection of particular species: to protect particular target species, which will usually be under threat (e.g., one of the last remaining populations); * Protection of habitats: to maintain or restore habitats, which will often be fragments of ecosystems; * Active management to maintain target species: to maintain viable populations of particular species, which might include for example artificial habitat creation or maintenance (such as artificial reef creation), supplementary feeding or other active management systems; * Active management of natural or semi-natural ecosystems: to maintain natural or semi-natural habitats that are either too small or too profoundly altered to be self-sustaining, e.g., if natural herbivores are absent they may need to be replaced by livestock or manual cutting; or if hydrology has been altered this may necessitate artificial drainage or irrigation; * Active management of culturally-defined ecosystems: to maintain cultural management systems where these have a unique associated biodiversity. Continual intervention is needed because the ecosystem has been created or at least substantially modified by management. The primary aim of management is maintenance of associated biodiversity.

This underpins the growth of national and individual wealth , and helps drive economic development .	Developing economies require access to English There are a number of clear unifying factors between the countries selected for this research despite their diverse geographical location. All are developing nations, attempting to set in place growth strategies and reposition themselves in the new global economy. An important element of these growth strategies is recognition of the importance of English, in order to communicate in the international business world. A focus on improved language skills has helped to attract more foreign investment, further increasing the need for English speakers in these countries. This underpins the growth of national and individual wealth, and helps drive economic development. Workers with solid English language skills are therefore in the best position to take the fullest advantage of new opportunities in these rapidly developing economies. Demand for English language education is driven by a number of factors. These include inward investment (with international companies typically using English for internal communication), ambitious individuals looking to sharpen their competitive edge in the labour market, as well as government efforts to encourage business investment by allocating greater budgets to the teaching of English. The level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is significant. FDI increased by an average of 6% over .

Coping strategies are used when normal livelihood function supported by rice farming is not possible. The following coping strategies are used during cropping seasons that are not impacted by climate hazards: accessing the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)[7], selling household assets, migration, daily wage labor, and loan taking. These coping strategies are part of a low-productivity/low-income rice-based livelihood system. Following climate hazards two additional coping strategies were employed: (i) reducing levels of household food consumption and (ii) securing government relief (Table 5).

The prospects for U.S. service suppliers in China should be promising, given the size of China's market. Nevertheless, while the United States maintained a $40.2 billion surplus in trade in services with China in FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 109 2017 (latest data available), the U.S. share of China's services market remained well below the U.S. share of the global services market. In 2018, numerous challenges persisted in a range of services sectors. As in past years, Chinese regulators continued to use case-by-case approvals, discriminatory regulatory processes, informal bans on entry and expansion, overly burdensome licensing and operating requirements, and other means to frustrate the efforts of U.S. suppliers of services to achieve their full market potential in China. These policies and practices affect U.S. service suppliers across a wide range of sectors, including banking, securities and asset management, insurance, electronic payments, cloud computing, telecommunications, online video and entertainment software, film production and distribution, and express delivery. In addition, China's Cybersecurity Law and related draft and final implementing measures include mandates to purchase domestic information and communications technology products and services, restrictions on cross-border data flows and requirements to store and process data locally, all of which undermine U.S. services suppliers' ability to take advantage of market access opportunities in China. China also has failed to fully address U.S. concerns in areas that have been the subject of WTO dispute settlement, including electronic payment services and theatrical film importation and distribution.

Milenkovic-Kerkovic and Dencic-Mihajlov ( 2012 ) underline in particular the advantages of factoring for service firms , which tend to be payrollintensive , have usually little proper collateral that can be used to secure traditional bank loan , and may have high investments in intangible assets , which are not always reflected in financial statements .	97. As a source of working capital financing, factoring is of particular interest for high-risk and informationally non-transparent firms, as well as firms with a solid base of customers but high investments in intangible assets, which cannot be used to secure bank loans. This is because the factor primarily evaluates the creditworthiness of the firm's customers and the validity of invoices, rather than the firm's financial statements, its fixed collateralisable assets or credit history. Hence, factoring may be especially advantageous for a SME that has difficulties in accessing bank lending but supplies larger customers, which are seen as more creditworthy than the firm itself. Milenkovic-Kerkovic and Dencic-Mihajlov (2012) underline in particular the advantages of factoring for service firms, which tend to be payrollintensive, have usually little proper collateral that can be used to secure traditional bank loan, and may have high investments in intangible assets, which are not always reflected in financial statements. 98. Factoring may also represent an instrument of choice to manage credit risk when the seller has a very sparse specialised investment in its customers and the cost of monitoring them is high (Smith and Schnucker, 1994). This can be the case also for customers located overseas, when export or international factoring is used. Through factoring, the seller outsources the monitoring functions and may indeed consider acceptance of invoices by the factor as a signal of its customers' creditworthiness. 99. Factoring is also useful for firms that grow faster than their credit lines, as, similarly to assetbased finance, it provides greater flexibility than conventional loans. In fact, as each account receivable is evaluated individually, in the event of increased sales, new receivables can be sold rapidly to a factor and the advanced cash used to respond to new orders. 100. As the extension of working capital does not depend on the firm's credit history, factoring can also serve the needs of new and young companies. At the same time, however, start-ups with low turnover may be little attractive to factors, as they are often too small, have an inadequate customer base and lack a track record in sales and economic management (Soufani, 2001).	Milenkovic-Kerkovic and Dencic-Mihajlov (2012) underline in particular the advantages of factoring for service firms, which tend to be payrollintensive, have usually little proper collateral that can be used to secure traditional bank loan, and may have high investments in intangible assets, which are not always reflected in financial statements.

Remote sensing technologies are rapidly evolving to detect the restoration of degraded areas or outside forested areas .	These experiences underscore the need for a consistent and feasible framework to assess the economic impacts of FLR approaches across different countries. IUCN is now working to develop a consistent framework to assess both jobs and induced economic impact from FLR actions. This framework will be tested and adapted to the diverse contexts found across the Bonn Challenge pledgers and ultimately offered as a means of reporting on this indicator. Finally, the demand for applying the Barometer as a means to credibly track progress on FLR implementation continues to grow. Self-assessments allow more pledgers to participate; however, the need for capacity to record adequate data and analyse findings remains strong. Remote sensing technologies are rapidly evolving to detect the restoration of degraded areas or outside forested areas. Such spatially explicit monitoring of restoration over multiple years can contribute data to the Barometer and also serve to triangulate information received from secondary sources such as project reports. To allow for transparency in tracking restoration within a landscape and within a mosaic of land uses, and to detect leakage at the national scale, Bonn Challenge pledgers should prioritise spatially explicit information on restoration sites. Accessing and making this spatial data publicly available is part of ongoing efforts. Indeed the development and application of the Barometer has benefited from existing national monitoring systems, as in El Salvador and the USA, but has also catalysed efforts by governments in pilot countries to accelerate the establishment of national FLR monitoring systems, for example in Brazil, or enhance the type of monitoring taking place, as in Rwanda.

Nearly 70 percent of U.S. high-value , consumer-oriented food product exports to Chile surpass one or more of the nutrient content limits and therefore are subject to marketing and advertising restrictions and require one or more of the front-of-package warning labels .	"In June 2016, the government of Chile implemented the Law on Food Nutritional Composition and its Advertising (known as Decree 13, and originally published in June 2012). The law imposes marketing and advertising restrictions and requires warning labels on prepackaged food and beverage products that exceed one or more specified thresholds set by Chile for sodium, sugar, energy (calories), and saturated fats. For each threshold exceeded, food and beverage products must bear a black ""stop sign"" shaped warning label with the words ""high in"" salt, sugar, energy, or saturated fat on the front of the product package. Fresh or unpackaged (bulk) food and beverage products are exempt from these requirements. The nutrient content limits are based on a 100-gram or 100-milliliter serving rather than the actual serving size most likely to be consumed in a single serving. Nearly 70 percent of U.S. high-value, consumer-oriented food product exports to Chile surpass one or more of the nutrient content limits and therefore are subject to marketing and advertising restrictions and require one or more of the front-of-package warning labels. Additionally, the law prohibits the use of images deemed to constitute ""advertising to children"" under the age of 14 for any product that exceeds any of the nutritional thresholds. Implementation of Decree 13, particularly with regard to whether registered trademarks constitute advertising on product packaging, has been inconsistent. Despite initial assurances that registered trademarks would not be affected, Chile's Ministry of Health (MINSAL) has restricted certain foreign products from entering the Chilean market on the basis that images on product packaging, including registered trademarks, fell within the scope of the Decree and constituted advertising to children. Enforcement of Decree 13 has resulted in delays, shortages, and repackaging that cost U.S. firms millions of dollars in lost sales and additional expenses. The United States has raised concerns regarding Decree 13 with Chile under the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement's Free Trade Commission, and other fora. The United States will continue to request from Chile a scientific justification for the measure."

It is more demanding to follow (and succeed in) an online course, compared to face-toface course. And the risk of drop-out is much bigger too than in face-to-face courses. Continuous assistance and mentoring are the key to fight these challenges. Partnership would be most welcome to explore one aspect of the project in which an IT specialist is needed, i.e. data science, artificial intelligence, and semantic scholarship. Funding could allow us to hire specific services (e.g. administrative support), and/or to provide for scholarships (e.g. research scholarship). Other types of partnerships are envisioned for instance with political/official stakeholders in education. A strong innovating social entrepreneurship spirit has kept the project self-sustained. The principles of open access and open science we have been following are aligned with the Portuguese national strategy for digital skills (Portugal INCoDe.2030) and, at an international level, particularly with the SDG 4. It all started in only one school. In this school year we have been working with 6 schools. We were reaching only the district of Lisboa, and now we are also reaching the district of Santarem. In the near future, we expect to further replicate the project (e.g. in the United Republic of Tanzania), aiming at continuing to foster the development of digital skills and competences, including ICT and informational, on an individual or global-society scale, ultimately where most needed in close alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

It is important to keep in mind that global biocapacity does not include any land set aside for other species.

For example , UNICEF was able to commence implementation of a school health program .	While it is not possible to make a definitive statement about the extent to which Mozambique's affected population has recovered, it certainly seems that there has been substantial level of recovery after the 2000 floods. The community survey found that a very positive feature of Mozambique's recovery work has been the rehabilitation and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure. Communities have welcomed schools, health posts, water supplies, and roads. The funding available through the recovery programs made it possible not only to repair or replace existing infrastructure, usually to higher standards, but also to build new facilities where none existed before. In the areas where additional facilities were provided, they were provided in accordance with previously identified priority areas, and human and financial resources were made available to staff these new facilities. For example in Chokwe, 249 new classrooms were built in the recovery phase. In total 101 schools were rehabilitated, constructed and equipped. An additional 4,500 children were enrolled at school in the district. Opportunities were also taken within recovery work to extend ongoing programs. For example, UNICEF was able to commence implementation of a school health program. Malaria prevention activities were extended to cover the whole of Gaza province under the National Malaria Control Program (UNICEF 2000d; Cosgrave 2001). The government's PARPA identifies isolation and lack of roads as major contributing factors to rural poverty.

Indicators of environmental concerns could be incorporated into these existing models to add an environmental component .	This overview calls for a more comprehensive analysis of the environmental effects of the life cycle of tobacco, including cigarette production, trade and disposal. One way to do this is to use economic modelling to include environmental costs in the overall costs of the tobacco trade. Another would be to assess the economic viability of crops other than tobacco with a lesser environmental impact. To achieve the first, a variant of a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis of the effect of the tobacco trade on the environment could be created. Indicators of environmental concerns could be incorporated into these existing models to add an environmental component. By using the results of CGE modelling (alongside established cost-benefit methodologies), environmental effects could be costed (while offsetting other effects) in order to arrive at a figure on the net costs of tobacco and cigarette production that takes account of environmental impact.

Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school. The project program implies long-term comprehensive training, which is designed for a period of up to 9 years and can take place in parallel with the basic educa1on and in addi1on to it; 4. Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project. The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy. The total number of employees and developers is about 100 people; 5. Constant adjustment and upda1ng of the training program through the introduc1on of modern educa1onal modules, relevant training plaKorms, as well as interes1ng and non-standard tasks and projects for selfimplementa1on;6. Sources of stable financial flows: The volume of financial revenues of the company is formed through three permanent channels: training in its own divisions, the implementa1on of franchises (lump-sum contribu1ons), and regular payments by exis1ng franchisees (royal1es); 7. The possibility of replica1on of the project in any locality (popula1on size does not maher);8. The project's target audience is children and adolescents aged 6-14 (children at this age are especially suscep1ble to new knowledge, are interested in modern technologies, and ac1vely use gadgets, but use them mainly for entertainment) and their parents (they care about quality educa1on of their children, and precisely at the age of 6-14 invest the core capital in their development).

The deadline for submission of the bids is almost twice as long as in Korea (55 compared to 30 days). The evaluation of all bids received takes five months, and back and forth between contractors and the procuring entity typically delays it by an additional month. Once the decision is made and all documents are ready, signing the contract should take place in a matter of days. Instead, it takes an additional three months because of the need to receive approval from the Court of Auditors. Once this approval is obtained and the contract is signed, the contractor still needs to obtain an activity permit and an environmental permit before being able to commence the works--taking an additional month.

Outsourcing and offshoring , along with the attendant transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods , contributes to productivity growth and improvements in living standards .	Winners and losers The obvious winners of globalization are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered tasks have migrated. Outsourcing and offshoring, along with the attendant transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and improvements in living standards. The development of more efficient industries and services encourage a reallocation of labor toward more productive uses. It also stimulates the subsequent development of other interrelated industries and sectors through backward and forward linkages. The development of a modern services sector can lead to greater coordination in value chains and make a further subdivision of tasks and the reorganization of production possible, leading to economies of scale.55 Multiple actors--including multinationals, civil society organizations and consumers in industrial countries--are increasingly active in efforts to improve working conditions and workers' rights in developing countries. To the extent that such efforts bear fruit, enhanced export opportunities improve workers' well-being.56 In all these ways, significant trickle-down effects can have widespread benefits for recipient countries.

"The experience of exile and life after it is also examined in the dossier ""Living, thinking, writing in exile"" (33/1, 2017) coordinated by the historian Ralph Schor, who strives to understand the paths and identity choices of a particular category of exiles: writers and thinkers. Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works.

The Doing Business indicators are based mostly on laws and regulations: approximately two-thirds of the data embedded in the Doing Business indicators are based on a reading of the law. In addition to filling out questionnaires, Doing Business respondents submit references to the relevant laws, regulations, and fee schedules. The Doing Business team collects the texts of the relevant laws and regulations and checks the questionnaire responses for accuracy. The team examines the civil procedure code, for example, to check the maximum number of adjournments in a commercial court dispute, and reads the insolvency code to identify if the debtor can initiate liquidation or reorganization proceedings. Because the data collection process involves an annual update of an established database, having a very large sample of respondents is not strictly necessary. In principle, 23About Doing Business the role of the contributors is largely advisory--helping the Doing Business team to locate and understand the laws and regulations.

Barriers to accessing assistive technology Major barriers in achieving universal assistive technology coverage include lack of awareness, governance, services, products, accessibility, human resources, affordability and economic resources.519 In many countries, persons with disabilities, their families and health-related personnel have limited knowledge about assistive products or where to get them. Moreover, policy and decision makers are often not aware of assistive technology and the possibilities they bring. In many countries, services are in short supply, often located far away from the people that need them. Similarly, the availability of safe and effective assistive products is limited in terms of quantity, as well as in terms of the range of types, models and sizes of the products. Lack of physical and cognitive accessibility of the transport system and the facilities where services are provided raise additional barriers. Another common barrier to assistive technology provisioning is the lack of properly trained personnel, skilled in manufacturing or adapting products, or delivering services. Finally, high costs for assistive products and services and traveling costs constitute major barriers. Taxes and duties on assistive products, or materials and components for their production, add to the costs.

During the same year we ran another special issue (guest editor Marie McAuliffe IOM research) focusing on irregularity and protection in southeast Asia. Building on the crisis in the Andaman sea in May 2015, contributions to this Special Issue pointed to the special features of irregular migration in southeast Asia and most notably the reluctance or inability of several host and origin countries to register their minorities and migrants and to provide them with a secure residence status. Indeed in southeast Asia the challenge of irregular labour migration or asylum seeking is particularly complex as several minority groups and most notably the Rohingya face problems of statelessness. This Special Issue sadly coincided with the new Rohingya crisis in summer and fall 2017 when Myanmar engaged into an ethnic cleansing strategy in the Rakhine state leading nearly 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.	During the same year we ran another special issue (guest editor Marie McAuliffe IOM research) focusing on irregularity and protection in southeast Asia.

Through these exchanges, the function of scientific journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use of categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place of migration in multicultural societies are examined. Other articles deal with epistemological challenges by reporting on survey methods in an urban context (use of photography, sound recordings), the measurement of migratory flows, the mapping of migratory flows, the museography of migratory histories.

They have historically relied on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods .	Ongoing land acquisition for business, mainly in southern Cunene and Huila provinces, continued to devastate local communities who relied on the land for their livelihoods. In April and May, the government of Huila presented its Transhumance Project, which included plans to appropriate a water fountain used by the community of Capela de Santo Antonio in the Kahila area of Gambos municipality. Capela de Santo Antonio is home to 600 families who depended on the fountain for drinking water, and for their livestock and irrigation. The community was not consulted over the plans and the authorities did not conduct an environmental impact assessment. The government of Huila remained determined to evict the community in violation of the Constitution and laws including the Land Law and the Environmental Law. In June, it came to light that the Angolan government had authorized the AgroIndustrial Horizonte 2020 mega project to appropriate 76,000 hectares of fertile land without the free, prior and informed consent of the affected communities.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE JOBS AGENDA Luc Christiaensen and Gabriel Lawin As highlighted in the previous chapter, increasing agricultural labor productivity is key to the jobs agenda in Coted'Ivoire. It plays to its comparative advantage; it raises earnings of the poor directly, and it helps generate demand for nonagricultural goods and services and thus off-farm employment. Also, given the large share of employment in agriculture, even fast growth of urban wage jobs will not suffice to absorb all new entrants. But not all agricultural strategies are equally successful in generating inclusive employment.

If a boom is under way , the development payoff of new manufacturing jobs Ensuring that rights and standards are upheld requires a focus not only on implementing acquired rights but also on expanding their reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of formal laws and regulations .	Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on reducing poverty. If a boom is under way, the development payoff of new manufacturing jobs Ensuring that rights and standards are upheld requires a focus not only on implementing acquired rights but also on expanding their reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of formal laws and regulations. Associations of informal workers can play a key role in informing them, helping them access legal mechanisms, and offering them collective voice. But often, information alone is not enough: garment workers in the Lao People's Democratic Republic reported that they were told about their basic conditions of employment, but they did not always understand the details, nor how to enforce their rights.46 Not only can organizations of informal workers support workers in learning about and accessing rights and standards, but they can also bring cases to court on behalf of individuals and groups.47 The quality of institutions for accountability affects the extent to which labor rights are enforced in practice.48 Because court proceedings are often lengthy and costly, alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes, including conciliation, mediation, and arbitration prior to court hearings can expand access to justice and grievance redress.49 These alternative mechanisms are especially valuable to workers who cannot access the court system due to high costs or other barriers.	If a boom is under way, the development payoff of new manufacturing jobs Ensuring that rights and standards are upheld requires a focus not only on implementing acquired rights but also on expanding their reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of formal laws and regulations.

The case studies were done after the quantitative survey was completed. Sampling for the case study narratives was done with the objective of selecting men and women with variation in household type (single female or dual adult) as well as in WEAI scores. In each country, enumerators worked with local leaders in two villages to purposefully select a total of 14 women and 6 men (20 per country) to be case study participants. Selection was split between women and men who were perceived to have high, medium, and low empowerment levels in agriculture. In total, 60 case study narratives were collected and transcribed into English with accompanying photographs and, in some cases, video footage. The pilot (or quantitative) portions of their data were entered and scored in the same way as the pilot data. These individuals' scores were checked to see whether they agreed with the general narrative and local perceptions (self-perceptions and perceptions of local leaders) of a person's empowerment. However, these data were not used in the computation of the WEAI results for each country.

The United States continues to press China to address the root causes of the excess capacity crisis in these industries , rather than engage in unjustified retaliation designed to punish American farmers , workers and companies .	According to the WTO, China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate averaged 9.8 percent in 2017 (latest data available). The MFN applied rate for agricultural goods averaged 15.6 percent, and the MFN applied rate for non-agricultural goods averaged 8.8 percent. China has bound 100 percent of its tariff lines in the WTO, and its highest WTO bound tariff rate is 65 percent for certain agricultural goods. In April 2018, China imposed tariffs ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent on a range of agricultural, steel 98 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS and aluminum products imported from the United States in retaliation against the President's decision to adjust U.S. imports of steel and aluminum articles under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. As noted below, the President's decision was based on a determination that the quantity and circumstances of U.S. imports of steel and aluminum products - including the circumstances of severe excess capacity and resulting overproduction emanating from China - threaten to impair U.S. national security. The United States continues to press China to address the root causes of the excess capacity crisis in these industries, rather than engage in unjustified retaliation designed to punish American farmers, workers and companies. The United States will take all necessary action to protect U.S. interests in the face of such retaliation. In this regard, in July 2018, the United States launched a dispute settlement proceeding against China in the WTO pertaining to China's retaliatory tariffs. In 2018, China imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs following U.S. action under Section 301. Specifically, in July and August 2018, China imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion and $16 billion in U.S. imports, respectively, and in September 2018, China imposed 5 percent to 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. imports. Separately, in 2018, China announced a series of MFN tariff reductions. According to China's Ministry of Finance, these steps reduced China's average tariff rate from 9.8 percent to 7.8 percent by the end of 2018. China also applies value-added taxes (VATs) of 10 or 16 percent to imported goods. However, VATs may be rebated for exports to support domestic industries and policies.

In parts of the world where many boys and girls do not attend school or drop out , youth literacy rates are much lower than global averages .	Of the 158 countries with data for 2012 (or the latest year over the period 2005-2012), 74 attained gender parity in adult literacy, 4 countries showed disparities to the disadvantage of men and 80 to the disadvantage of women. Women's literacy rates were less than two thirds those of men's in 22 of those countries, four of which are located in Southern Asia (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan), one in Western Asia (Yemen), and the rest in sub-Saharan Africa.55 The vast majority of young men and women have basic reading and writing skills The vast majority of young people (aged 15 to 24) in the world are literate. Over the period 1990- 2012, the global literacy rate for young women rose from 79 to 87 per cent and from 88 to 92 per cent for young men (figure 3.17). This reflects increased participation in formal schooling among younger generations. Youth literacy is almost universal in the more developed regions, in Eastern Asia and in the Caucasus and Central Asia; it is close to being universal in Latin America and in South-Eastern Asia. In parts of the world where many boys and girls do not attend school or drop out, youth literacy rates are much lower than global averages. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the rates are among the lowest in the world, only 64 per cent of young women and 76 per cent of young men are literate. In Oceania and Southern Asia, young men and women have attained basic literacy skills at rates significantly lower than the global averages for each sex.

That's the best achievement in life.""69 Ela Bhatt, a lawyer and the founder of Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India, described her struggle with the language of work, given the multiplicity of tasks that people do every day and over time: ""A small farmer works on her own farm. In tough times, she also works on other farms as a laborer. When the agriculture season is over, she goes to the forest to collect gum and other forest produce. Year round, she produces embroidered items either at a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader who comes to her village to buy goods. Now, how should her trade be categorized? Does she belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sector, or the home-based work sector? Should she be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker?""70 These questions are not merely semantic. The words and categories that are used to describe work have tangible implications. Views on what a job is and what it means almost inevitably influence views on what policies for jobs should look like. Those for whom the word job is associated with the image of a worker in an office or a factory, with an employer and a paycheck, may focus on a supportive investment climate for firms. Those for whom the word also encompasses farming, street vending, waste picking, and domestic employment may think of jobs policies as including land reform, agricultural extension, urban policies, or the provision of voice to the most vulnerable workers."

Gianfreda and Vallanti ( 2017 ) analyze the impact of court delays in settling labor disputes in Italy .	Gianfreda and Vallanti (2017) analyze the impact of court delays in settling labor disputes in Italy. The authors argue that delays in trials of labor disputes increase firing costs. They also show that the rate of job turnover is significantly lower in judicial districts with longer trials.3 DOING BUSINESS 202034 Efficient courts improve financial markets. Ponticelli and Alencar (2016) find that firms operating in Brazilian municipalities with less congested civil courts experienced a larger increase in the use of secured loans. In the years following a reform that increased the protection of secured creditors, firms also experienced a significant increase in investment and output value. These results underscore the importance of the timely enforcement of creditors' rights by the courts to improve access to finance.4 Faster and cheaper access to justice reduces some of the obstacles faced by entrepreneurs. Lichand and Soares (2014) analyze the creation of special civil tribunals in Sao Paulo in the 1990s that expanded the geographic presence of the justice system, simplified judicial procedures, and increased the speed of dispute adjudication. They find that the implementation of the tribunals led to higher rates of entrepreneurship among individuals with higher levels of education.

Jobs challenges are not the same in agrarian economies , resource-rich countries , conflict-affected countries , or in countries with high youth unemployment .	Data and analysis can be used to identify misaligned incentives, indicated by a gap between the individual and the social value of jobs. Several research areas deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can measure the tax burden that applies to capital and labor and assess the crosssubsidization between individuals or firms. The methods of labor economics can uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings, or between the social and individual returns to schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on reducing poverty. Productivity studies allow for quantifying the spillovers from employment in foreign-owned investment companies, or in cities. Environmental studies shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs. And valA simple approach to setting policy priorities follows five steps (figure 19): * Step one: What are good jobs for development? Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities. The nature of those jobs varies with the characteristics of the country, including its phase of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges are not the same in agrarian economies, resource-rich countries, conflict-affected countries, or in countries with high youth unemployment. And the jobs with the greatest development impact differ as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. * Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under way, the development value of new manufacturing jobs might materialize. But it might not if, for example, inadequate urbanization policies limit the establishment of new firms.

By interacting iteratively with the outside world they can learn more about the problem , the people affected by it and how they can help .	"63. The concept of effectuation represents a quite practical and hands-on approach to teaching ""through"" entrepreneurship. It has been developed by Saras Sarasvathy and colleagues (see for example Sarasvathy, 2001, Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005, Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011). Effectuation is described as an iterative process of decision making and active commitment seeking that results in creation of new value, where each iteration is started with questions such as ""Who am I?"", ""what do i know?"" and ""Whom do I know?"". Sarasvathy and Venkataraman (2011) propose that entrepreneurship could be regarded as a generic method for creating potentially valuable change by unleashing human potential, and has contrasted this to the scientific method designed to harness mother nature. Viewing entrepreneurship as a generic method holds much promise for the field of entrepreneurial education, but requires emphasis on taking action, value creation and using creativity tools (Neck and Greene, 2011). 64. Effectuation constitutes a useful toolbox for teachers in any domain and on any educational level. A student team can be asked to identify a simple problem in real life they would like to address. Preferably this problem is identified by taking into account the team's diverse interests, competencies and previous experiences. By interacting iteratively with the outside world they can learn more about the problem, the people affected by it and how they can help. They need not be anywhere near a solution when initiating the process, they only need to focus on the next step that needs to be taken to approach the problem and learn more about it. A book by Read et al. (2011) targeted to teachers and practitioners provides ample practical advice when using the effectual approach. This book and its concepts is somewhat venture creation focused, but many of the principles can be applied to value creation processes in all stages of education."

Many processed food products, such as confectionary products, baked goods, and miscellaneous food preparations, are subject to a special tariff code system in the EU. Under this system, often referred to as the Meursing table, the EU charges a tariff on each imported product based on the product's content of milk protein, milk fat, starch, and sugar. As a result, products that the United States and other countries might consider equivalent for tariff classification purposes sometimes receive different rates of duty in the EU depending on the particular mix of ingredients in each product. The difficulty of calculating Meursing duties imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on, and creates uncertainty for, exporters, especially those seeking to ship new products to the EU.

This special volume brought together original and diversified contributions. In addition to the classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists. Through these exchanges, the function of scientific journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use of categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place of migration in multicultural societies are examined. Other articles deal with epistemological challenges by reporting on survey methods in an urban context (use of photography, sound recordings), the measurement of migratory flows, the mapping of migratory flows, the museography of migratory histories. Other articles analyse more current and topical situations: the United States' migration policy and the revival of the ""Silk Road"" between Asia and Europe."

At the risk of simplifying, four main forces lie behind increases in an economy's per capita output. The first is the use of more capital per unit of labor. The second is an increase in the number of people working, relative to the total population. This happens when fertility declines and the share of adults in the total population increases; it is also happens when women shift their work from household chores to income-generating activities. The third mechanism through which output can grow is by making people themselves more productive. The acquisition of skills, also known as human capital accumulation, allows a person to do more using the same amount of capital. The fourth mechanism is technological progress, BOX 3.1 What drives economic growth? measured as changes in total factor productivity.

The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective .	Across survey years and labor input variables (family and hired), rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective. Cotton and cashew producers make the most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Finally, consistent with findings from other countries (for example, Damiani (2003) for Brazil), vegetable production is also highly labor intensive. Its potential has so far been largely left unexploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but much scope for improvement remains.

Governments understand need for increased investment in education To buttress a strong basic level of English among the population, government expenditure on education as a proportion of overall expenditure is growing. Enrolment in tertiary education is high in Nigeria and Cameroon. Higher education in both is increasingly conducted in English, suggesting that graduates from these countries are better equipped for the international work environment. Rwanda, Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently less prepared, mainly due to lower funding, although this is changing as government expenditure on education increases. The primary motivating factor for improving English skills is the desire to improve employment opportunities. The governments of the five researched countries recognise that there is a clear requirement to invest more in their education systems. Rwanda was most dynamic in this area, with 21% of total government expenditure spent on education. Bangladesh and Cameroon spent some 8% and 17%, respectively. In Nigeria and Pakistan education accounted for 13% and 2% of government expenditure. To put this into perspective, a developed country such as the UK spends 10-12% of total annual expenditure on education. Education seen as poverty escape route Each of the researched countries saw economic growth slow in 2009. However, the fact that English is regarded as offering a key competitive advantage in a difficult employment environment means that demand for English education throughout these countries remained high.

Time : This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities .	The early literature on empowerment typically used one global measure for empowerment. For example, parents' education was often used to measure agency or decision-making within the household (Alkire 2007); husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981). However, it is possible that agency differs across different spheres of life and can exist simultaneously in different ways. For example, a person can be fully employed as a wife and mother, excluded from the labor force by social conventions, and recently empowered to vote by political processes. Because such distinctions have policy relevance, it is important to identify and compare agency achievements in different domains rather than in one alone (Alkire 2007, 166). Because agency and empowerment are experienced with different tasks and can be described and measured with different domains, Alkire (2005) suggests that most measures of agency and empowerment should be domain specific. For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1. Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment. 2. Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit. 3. Income: This dimension concerns sole or joint control over the use of income and expenditures. 4. Leadership: This dimension concerns leadership in the community, here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public. 5. Time: This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities.

In West Africa, O. glaberrima is a dominant crop grown in the flooded areas of the Niger and Sokoto River basins. It is broadcast on hoed fields. On shallowly flooded land, a rainfed wetland crop is either directly sown by broadcasting or dibbling, or transplanted. About 45% of the land planted to rice in Africa belongs to the upland (dryland) culture, largely under bush fallow or after the ground has been hoed. Some African farmers still use axes, hoes, and bush knives in land preparation. In hydromorphic soils, O. glaberrima behaves like a selfperpetuating weed. In wetland fields planted to O. sativa, O. glaberrima has become a weed.	In West Africa, O. glaberrima is a dominant crop grown in the flooded areas of the Niger and Sokoto River basins.

The capacity and resources to work land are generally the limiting factors to cultivation in many areas of Mozambique (GoM 2001c). However, there was a low incidence of land conflict as millions of people returned to rural areas after the war ended, with the allocation of land being managed through local processes and with local leaders (Tanner 1996). The 1997 Land Law represented an important effort to integrate customary and formal legal frameworks, to secure land rights for communities, families and individuals, and stimulate development in rural Mozambique. It emerged from an unparalleled process of dialogue and collaboration between the government, civil society, and specialists (Tanner 2002). Some conflicting interests in land and resource use did emerge in post-war Mozambique, particularly in areas near Maputo (McGregor 1997).

The latter effects are currently largely hidden in the numbers as they are largely incorporated in the manufacturing ( food processing , machinery ) and service ( storage , transport , wholesale , retail ) sectors of the national accounts .	There are also caveats to the somewhat more pessimistic perspective from the demand side. While Engel's Law holds globally, its strength at the national level depends on the tradability and comparative advantage of the countries' agricultural commodities. Furthermore, part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture, following the lower (relative) demand for staples as incomes rise, will be offset by the increasing demand for higher-value and processed agricultural products as countries and their populations get richer. This creates new jobs on the farm, but increasingly also offthe farm, in the expanding agricultural value chains and agribusinesses that is in extended agriculture. The latter effects are currently largely hidden in the numbers as they are largely incorporated in the manufacturing (food processing, machinery) and service (storage, transport, wholesale, retail) sectors of the national accounts. Yet, it is argued that it is exactly the extent to which countries manage to transform their agriculture away from staple crops, as they get richer and their staple crop productivity reaches sufficiently high levels, which determines whether they can generate productive employment for the poor and sustain the pace of rural poverty reduction.

South Africa has, by far, the largest T&T industry in SubSaharan Africa ranking second regionally and 61st globally on the index. The country's most significant advantage is its combination of natural (15th) and cultural resources (23rd). While not optimal, the country also boasts a decent business environment (57th) and beats regional benchmarks regarding human resources and labour (81st), ICT readiness (75th) and overall infrastructure (60th). Nevertheless, the country still fell eight places on the index since 2017. South Africa has several critical issues undermining its overall competitiveness. It has one of the worst safety and security environments (132nd) in the world, and is plagued by high homicide rates (135th), a significant impact of crime on business (131st) and increasing fears of terrorism. Combined with poor health and hygiene conditions (113th), the security situation diminishes South Africa's attractiveness for visitors and investors alike. In addition, the country still scores low on the Environmental Sustainability pillar (124th), which is characterized by significant deforestation (124th) and declining environmental enforcement and regulatory stringency (46th to 66th), posing a risk to South Africa's natural resource advantage.

Doing business 20206 what do doing business 2020 data show? When low-income economies achieve higher levels of economic efficiency, they tend to reduce the income gap with more developed ones. One study quantifies the relationship between the regulation of entry and the income gap between developing countries and the United States. It shows that substantial barriers to entry in developing economies account for almost half of the income gap with the United States.3 These barriers prevent growth and result in persistent poverty. Encouragingly, Doing Business 2020 continues to show a steady convergence between developing and developed economies, especially in the area of business incorporation (figure O.2). Since 2003/04, 178 economies have implemented 722 reforms captured by the starting a business indicator set, either reducing or eliminating barriers to entry. In all, 106 economies eliminated or reduced minimum capital requirements, about 80 introduced or improved one-stop shops, and more than 160 simplified preregistration and registration formalities. More remains to be done, however.	Doing business 20206 what do doing business 2020 data show?	Doing Business 2020: Comparing Business Regulation in 190 Economies	World Bank Group	2019

Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries .	Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries. Rates of new firm registration are low in most countries in the region.83 And even when they do get started, small firms face barriers in growing into sizable companies. The vast majority of Tunisian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them are one-person entities, and only 0.4 percent have 100 workers or more. But these large firms account for more than one-third of all jobs, more than all the one-person firms combined. A study of their dynamics over a decade shows that micro-and small firms hardly ever become large firms. Moreover, one-person firms only very rarely graduate into the small size category, and many are likely to shut down.84 While countries with high youth unemployment may face a large youth bulge or education quality issues, problems are often on the demand side, with limited competition reducing employment opportunities, especially for highly skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased. This prospect is unlikely to materialize, however, as long as political connections remain more important than entrepreneurial capacity to enter they would make a major dent in the aggregate unemployment rate is unclear. Better matches between jobseekers and employment opportunities would result in large increases in total employment only if there were many unfilled vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle East and North Africa. Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and by increasing privatization and deregulation.79 Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for the most part.80 The problem is similar with training programs. Educated youth have the capacity to learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could even provide on-the-job training as needed. But training may not change aspirations.	Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries.	World Development Report 2013: Jobs	World Bank	2012

The increased production already achieved has stimulated the industry , and raised interest in exports .	There has already been a major impact in production in a very short time. Increased production has impacted negatively, as over-production has already occurred. However, there is potential for increased local consumption, and alternate uses and new products need to be investigated. There is interest, and potential benefit, from developing cottage industries, where peanut products could be used in school feeding projects. The children dislike the powdered milk currently used. The increased production already achieved has stimulated the industry, and raised interest in exports. Traders from Georgetown have shown interest, and sales into these markets have resulted in 20% increases in net returns. However, distances from the port and poor road communication operate against realizing this potential. Farmers, although few women appear to be involved, will benefit from improved food security and higher income through adoption of new technologies. Processors and consumers will benefit from better quality, nutritionally superior, and safe foods, particularly for children. Development of alternate uses may help to overcome over-production.

The financial crisis of 2008 has reopened heated debates about the appropriate level of regulation of the financial sector and the need to balance prudence and stability with innovation and inclusion .	Access to finance provides firms with the ability to expand, to invest in new technologies, or to smooth cash flow over time.12 Financial markets also play an important role in the allocation of resources toward more productive uses.13 Transparency within the financial sector avoids resources being channeled to those with political connections or economic power, and it also supports financial inclusion. Expanded credit registries keeping track of positive as well as negative episodes in debtors' histories help people demonstrate that they are creditworthy. But regulatory oversight is needed to ensure transparency and competition in the allocation of funds.

In terms of agricultural self-employment, farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively well endowed with land and fairly market-oriented. Four in five smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in five reporting to sell their complete harvest. In other words, most farmers engage with the market and have moved well beyond farming for subsistence only (Table 1.6). Close to 30 percent of households reported selling 100 percent of their agricultural production. This includes the sale of food and cash crops. As such, the data suggest that the vast majority of selling households are growing and marketing both cash and food crops, while very few of them specialize in food crops or subsistence agriculture. Around half of selling households are producing (and selling) both cash and food crops. Those focusing only on the production and sale of cash crops represent 32.7 percent. Only 17.2 percent of selling households are growing and marketing only food crops. Unlike selling households, non-selling households are more specialized in food crops. Close to 47 percent of them grew food crops only.	Unlike selling households, non-selling households are more specialized in food crops.

Building on the framework of the WorldBank regional report on Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa (Filmer et al. 2014), employment is divided in three main types of employment: agricultural employment, nonagricultural self-employment, and modern wage employment. Figure1.6 summarizes the composition of employment in Coted'Ivoire in February 2014 based on these categories. As noted above, unemployment is relatively low, and so is the number of wage jobs in the economy. Only 22.8 percent of employed individuals hold wage jobs, mostly in nonagricultural wage jobs (19.9 percent).8 By contrast, 47.5 percent of the employed population is self-employed in agriculture, and 29.7 percent is self-employed in nonagricultural activities. Self-employed individuals do not operate in a formal 'labor market' for wage jobs. They mostly work for themselves and create their own jobs. Most adults work on family farms, or in nonagricultural individual enterprises selling goods or services in small-scale informal activities. While there is substantial variation within these employment sectors (including in agricultural and nonagricultural microenterprises), on average these occupations tends to have low productivity.

"The European Review of International Migration (REMI) is a specialised journal on international migration and inter-ethnic relations. Multidisciplinary (sociology, anthropology, demography, geography, history, political science, etc.), it publishes in French, English and Spanish in-depth articles of empirical or theoretical orientation, as well as research notes that present the first results of ongoing research. Each review number includes a thematic issue which is supplemented by varia. A legal chronical since 2016 takes into account the growing importance of legal issues related to international migration and migration policy issues. This reborn chronical is moderated by a group of specialised lawyers who are developing a network around issues such as international migration law (conventions, protocols), reception and protection conditions for unaccompanied minors, protection and promotion of the social rights of migrants, human rights as protection of migrants' rights, access to health, labour law for irregular migrants. 25 Articles cited in the journal editors' contribution can be found at: https://journals.openedition.org/remi/. 339WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 REMI celebrated its 30th anniversary by publishing a special issue entitled ""Renewing the Migration Issues"" (32/3-4 2016). This special volume brought together original and diversified contributions. In addition to the classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists. Through these exchanges, the function of scientific journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use of categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place of migration in multicultural societies are examined. Other articles deal with epistemological challenges by reporting on survey methods in an urban context (use of photography, sound recordings), the measurement of migratory flows, the mapping of migratory flows, the museography of migratory histories. Other articles analyse more current and topical situations: the United States' migration policy and the revival of the ""Silk Road"" between Asia and Europe."

Seventh, despite good prospects for new jobs and better earnings within agriculture, over time, most jobs will be generated outside agriculture. As highlighted in the previous section, the prospects for new, better, and inclusive jobs in agriculture are particularly good in Coted'Ivoire (compared to other countries), given its relatively low staple crop productivity (Chapter3), its high potential for expanding its labor-intensive cash crop export and the production and value addition in high-value agricultural products through inclusive value chain development. Nonetheless, the overarching deeper trend remains toward a decline in the overall share of agricultural employment over time. This follows from the power of Engel's Law, which drives the (worldwide) structural transformation propelled by the lower income elasticity of the demand for food compared to the demand for non-food.

But in doing so, they also exert pressure on the least productive ones to contract or exit. Global integration also generates knowledge spillovers. These arise through exposure to new technologies embodied in traded goods or through new management practices in companies receiving FDI.

Children were routinely denied adequate access to legal representation, translation, health services and psychosocial support. Basic education was not available in the centres and most children were not enrolled in local schools. Limited social and educational activities were available several days a week and organized exclusively by NGOs and humanitarian organizations. The authorities lacked developed systems for early identification, assessment and referral mechanisms for unaccompanied children. Children often did not have access to qualified legal guardians and legal representation. In February, mayors and residents of several towns refused to accommodate two unaccompanied refugee children in facilities in their communities. The boys were moved several times and finally separated, causing the younger boy to abscond. In September, the National Assembly adopted, in the first reading, amendments to the Law on Foreigners. They included an obligation to provide legal representation for all unaccompanied children and to increase the authority of the Social Assistance Directorate in all proceedings involving unaccompanied children who had not applied for international protection. The amendments, however, proposed repealing the requirement for an individual assessment of the best interests of the child before placing children in short-term immigration detention. Human rights organizations warned that the proposals would legitimize the practice of ""attaching"" unaccompanied children to oftenunrelated adults travelling in the same group in order to avoid the prohibition of detention of children."

( 2016a ) and Enfors ( 2013 ) in highlighting the importance of contextual factors to explain resilience in farmers .	Investigations have been made into the use of resilience as a concept to guide development. These studies have focused on the following: identifying which economic units are or are not resilient; the differential impacts of shocks on these units; and the responses of different economic units to these shocks (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Akter and Mallick 2013, Constas et al. 2014, Alfani et al. 2015, Jain et al. 2015, Cisse and Barrett 2016). Analysis of this nature enables interventions to be targeted to increase the resistance of farmers to hazards, e.g., flood resistant seeds (Dar et al. 2013) or enable ex post coping (e.g., Akter et al. 2016). Our work builds upon the arguments of Bene et al. (2016a) and Enfors (2013) in highlighting the importance of contextual factors to explain resilience in farmers. Our analysis strongly suggests that a range of interacting contextual factors prevent the emergence of resilient, high-return rice cropping livelihoods. Agricultural interventions need to take into account these contextual factors to shift rice cropping onto a trajectory toward resilience. Our context-based analysis shows how rice cultivation and the prevailing social norms, formal institutions, and economy interact to shape coping capacity and the distribution of resilience. We argue that context based studies that explain how resilience occurs and resilience measurement studies that monitor economic units pre-and postshock are complementary.

Integrating a strong technology transfer component , especially in the host country would facilitate the transfer of Peanut-CRSP technologies ( new food products and processes ) to the region through Senegal .	Specific: Peanut CRSP to continue product development in the next phase. Further development of value added peanut products and improvement and fine-tuning of the processes are needed to bring them to pilot production stage. Integrating a strong technology transfer component, especially in the host country would facilitate the transfer of Peanut-CRSP technologies (new food products and processes) to the region through Senegal. Refocus the efforts in the U.S. and Senegal towards more commercialization of these technologies and intensive training of key stakeholders, in the U.S. and Senegal. This would necessitate new partnerships involving the private food industry (focusing on small-to medium-scale businesses), the public (government entities), and public (or NGOs) extension providers, health workers, traders, and other stakeholders, including donors. ITA should continue to provide research support and coordination to ensure sustainability and quality of the products produced in Senegal. The Peanut CRSP project at NCATSU includes emphasis on development of aflatoxin-free value-added peanut foods, feeds and nutraceuticals from peanut products and co-products suitable for the Senegal and U.S. markets. Work is examining the use of aluminosilicate clays (Attapulgite) to reduce levels of aflatoxins in cottage industry peanut paste. The results are very promising. It is recommended that this work be expanded to include that of Peanut CRSP project OKS55. The combined effort could focus on the aflatoxin problem throughout countries in West Africa. Proper funding would be required to assure success of the program.

The extent of the learning crisis varies across countries.

Among these DCPs, countries such as Chad, Mali and Niger register less than 20 percent of students achieving minimum proficiency levels in both reading and mathematics by the end of primary education. However, other DCPs have more than 80 percent of students achieving minimum proficiency level in mathematics or reading by the end of primary education (for instance, Albania, Tanzania and Vietnam).

Epidemics contribute significantly to worsening gender inequality and have disproportionate effects on the educational outcomes of female pupils. Girls may face greater expectations of caregiving at home, such that prolonged closures are likely to exacerbate inequalities, and a lot of girls will find it difficult to balance schoolwork and their increased domestic responsibilities (UN Women, 2020). Studies have shown that in cases where schools remained closed for a significant period of time (such as a full academic year), as happened in Sierra Leone, girls and young women found it harder to re-enrol even after schools reopened, with enrolment rates falling close to 16% in the most disrupted villages (Rohwerder, 2020).

Overall, the available theoretical, empirical and historical evidence overwhelmingly suggests an important role for agricultural productivity growth to increase the earnings of the poor. The gains from intersectoral labor reallocation are less than commonly assumed, partly because of somewhat better labor market integration and lower agricultural underemployment than observed elsewhere.

At 7.3 percent and 4.9 percent per year on average, agricultural GDP growth has also been solid in Ethiopia and Rwanda (albeit half the growth rate outside agriculture). smallholder based, and more than 60 percent of the poor are smallholder farmers (WorldBank 2011a).39 latest recent Country Economic Memorandum for Coted'Ivoire (WorldBank 2011b) indicated an annual growth potential for agriculture over the next decade of at least 5 percent. Since the post-election crisis (2011-2014), it has been growing at an average of 5.7 percent per year. This does not do away with a continuing role for facilitating movement out of agriculture, as elaborated upon in section 2.3, but it highlights the continuing need and potential for raising labor productivity through agriculture at the current juncture.

Meanwhile, the Hebei Iron and Steel Group (HBIS) bought the controlling 51% interest in the Swiss-based steel trading firm Duferco reported to underline the shift to production abroad and trading the metal globally.18 By improving connectivity via infrastructure, the Initiative also has the potential to lay the foundation for a platform for trade and investment with China at its centre. 6. The financing of connectivity projects within the BRI The main sources of funding for the bulk of these BRI-participating projects are the Chinese development banks, the USD 40 billion Silk Road Fund, and two of the large state-owned commercial banks.

With the accelerating loss of productive rice land to rising sea levels, salinization, erosion, and human settlements, the problem becomes one of increasing yields under ever more trying circumstances. From 1965-67 through 1989-91, the improvements in productivity spawned by the Green Revolution spread rapidly. During those years, total rice production almost doubled. Most of this increase came from increased yields and increased cropping intensity, although some resulted from new land brought under cultivation or shifted into rice from other crops. Much of the yield increase could be traced to the introduction of the dwarfing gene and to the increased use of fertilizer, irrigation water, and other inputs. Further yield increases have been constrained by 6 Rice almanac diminishing returns and have been increasingly difficult to achieve.

Air transport infrastructure improvements show a noticeable increase on route capacity and the number of airlines providing services in individual countries .	Results Overview As has been an ongoing trend over the last four years, T&T competitiveness continues to improve worldwide, and connectivity enabling--and enabled by--the industry remains on an upward path. The TTCI 2019 results show that air transportation, digital connectivity and international openness are advancing in a global context of growing trade tensions and nationalism. Air transport infrastructure improvements show a noticeable increase on route capacity and the number of airlines providing services in individual countries. International openness is progressing, with lower-income economies leading the way. Digital connectivity has been bolstered by a growing number of individuals using the internet and mobile internet subscriptions, meaning more economies are now in a position to leverage the growing list of digital T&T services. Travel has also become, for the most part, less expensive and safer, with the Price Competitiveness pillar, for example, showing the greatest percentage increase since 2017. Lastly, T&T is increasingly being prioritized by stakeholders around the world as measured by more favourable perceptions of government prioritization, increased industry funding and more effective marketing campaigns.

Secondary education comprises three branches: theoretical, technical-vocational and skill-knowledge (kar-Danesh). Each are divided into different fields. The required total number of credits leading to the High School Diploma is 96. The one-year preuniversity program prepares students to enter university and higher education institutions. To enter this course, students should pass the appropriate exam. After successfully passing the one-year period, they are granted the Pre-University Certificate and can sit for the National Entrance Exam of universities and higher education institutions (Concour). Qualified students entering the technical-vocational branch can continue studies leading to the Post-Diploma degree (technician) or sit for the Pre-University Examination.

Of crucial importance are adequate health and nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life, from inception to two years of age. Brain development in this period affects physical health, learning abilities, and social behavior throughout life.29 In the early years, a child develops all the basic brain and physiological structures upon which later growth and learning depend. Stunting in early childhood has been proven to have a significant negative effect on cognitive development; iodine deficiency can lead to poor brain development; and insufficient cognitive stimulation reduces learning abilities.

The International Labour Organization's core labor standards provide guidance on what is unacceptable in the areas of child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association and collective bargaining.45 Health and safety at work also necessitate attention by governments and employers. Ensuring that standards are enforced in practice requires providing access to information to workers and employers. Information can increase the extent to which workers are able and willing to hold employers and intermediaries accountable. It can also help ensure that all parties involved are aware of their obligations. Strengthening institutions for enforcement and grievance redress is another necessary building block. revealed that, in diverse countries, a significant share of students were unable to read a single word: around 30 percent in Honduran rural schools, 50 percent in The Gambia and more than 80 percent in Mali.34 Enrollment numbers, hence, do not necessarily signal actual learning and skill building.

Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school.

Diversification in high-value agricultural products ( meat , dairy , fruits , and vegetables ) remains limited .	Strong yield growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversified the cash crop mix, but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products. Overall, net agricultural production value increased by 2.5 percent per year (between 2004/06 and 2011/13). The annual increase was higher in rice (11.5 percent), other export crops (4.2 percent) (driven especially by cashew and cotton),57 and meat (3.3 percent, especially chicken [9.2 percent] and cattle) (Figure3.5). This resulted in a rising share of rice in total output (from 3.5 percent on average during 2004/06 to 6.2 percent during 2011/13) and a diversification in cash crops beyond cocoa (whose share declined from 26.6 percent to 24.2 percent). Diversification in high-value agricultural products (meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables) remains limited. The share of meat increased only slightly from 7.9 percent to 8.3 percent, while the share of other high-value agricultural products decreased slightly from 16.5 percent to 15.8 percent). 56 The 2013 national employment survey (ENSETE 2013) puts the average rice yields at 1.8 tons per ha (rising to 2 tons per ha in the subsequent 2015 national household survey ENV 2015) --though the median is only 600 and 1000 kg per ha, respectively. This is substantially lower than the averages reported in the macro data from the national statistics, which rose from slightly below 2 tons/ha during the mid-2000s to about 5 tons/ha in 2013-2014. This discrepancy between the macro and micro data (or national/administrative and survey statistics) warrants further investigation. Some of the discrepancy may be the result from the fact that the household surveys capture only one of the rice harvests. They also exclude large commercial farms where yields are higher (higher input use, better water control, and typically more than one rice cycle per year). 57 The value of coffee and pineapple production declined.

The education provision is such that in majority cases the students require study at home in order to supplement school education .	Private tutoring is defined as fee-based tutoring that provides supplementary instruction to children in academic subjects they study in the mainstream education system (Dang & Rogers, 2008, p.161). Educational institutions are the places where tuition is supposed to take place. The teachers and the students jointly participate in classroom situation to achieve education. The education provision is such that in majority cases the students require study at home in order to supplement school education. It is done in the form of homework and learning what was asked by the schoolteachers. Studying at home requires tutoring support, which sometimes the parents, relatives or the household members provide and sometimes do not, so, an external support is often sought for this and such support is sometimes provided free of cost and often on a payment basis. Therefore, private tutoring means payment-based tutoring support to the students outside official school hour (Nath, 2006, p.1).

Such a source of motivation is important in education since learning and motivation are strongly linked ( Boekaerts , 2010 ) .	"67. Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a theoretical framework having its origins in the domain of organizational behavior. It has been identified as useful in the entrepreneurial education domain due to its emphasis on opportunities rather than problems (Blenker et al., 2011). As entrepreneurship has been defined as the crossroad between individuals and opportunities (Shane, 2003), AI is a theoretical framework implicitly anchored in entrepreneurship. It has been described as a method suitable for generating new ideas triggering action and ""a new lens for seeing old issues"" (Bushe and Kassam, 2005), and can lead to questions such as ""What methods have been successful before?"", ""What can we learn from what works well?"", ""How can we get more of what is good in the future?"" and ""What do we need to do to realize our dreams?"". A unique contribution of this theory is its strong capacity to infuse inspiration, joy and motivation into the teams working with a value creation process which often requires coping with change. Positive energy and motivation are key in change processes, since people's resistance to change is well documented (Beer et al., 1990, Kotter, 1995).

Japan classifies fungicides applied pre-harvest as pesticides, and fungicides applied post-harvest as food additives. Japan's requirement that post-harvest fungicides be classified as food additives does not have a significant impact on domestic producers, as Japanese farmers do not generally apply fungicides after harvest. Japan previously required separate review processes for the pre-harvest and post-harvest uses of each fungicide. In 2018, Japan registered the first fungicide through a single review process that is intended to lead to more timely reviews. The United States remains concerned that Japan requires products treated with a post-harvest fungicide to be labeled at the point of sale with a statement indicating a list of the chemicals used, which may put U.S. products at a disadvantage relative to Japanese products by dampening demand for U.S. products.

Thai law enforcement 's investigative and prosecutorial capacity is limited , and Thai laws focus predominantly on abuse of office rather than financial or asset-related malfeasance .	"Despite ongoing legislative and administrative efforts to address corruption, the issue continues to hamper Thailand's economy and trade. The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is the primary body vested with powers and duties to counter corruption in the public sector. However, several agencies have jurisdiction over corruption issues, and their actions are not always complementary. Thai law enforcement's investigative and prosecutorial capacity is limited, and Thai laws focus predominantly on abuse of office rather than financial or asset-related malfeasance. Anticorruption mechanisms continue to be employed unevenly and for political purposes, and the lack of transparency in many administrative procedures serves to facilitate corruption. In October 2017, NACC issued ""guidelines on appropriate internal control measures for juristic persons to prevent bribery of state officials, foreign public officials, and agents of public international organizations"" to address the supply side of corruption. On July 22, 2018, a new anti-corruption law (known officially as the Act Supplementing the Constitution Relating to the Prevention and Suppression of Corruption B.E. 2561 (2018)) came into effect, repealing and replacing the 1999 Organic Act on Counter Corruption and its various amendments. The new anticorruption law maintains a key provision criminalizing bribe-giving by legal entities but expands the definition of the legal entities to include any foreign company (registered abroad but operating in Thailand) and its associated persons (employees, joint venture partners, agents, etc.). The mandatory fines for bribery are at least an equal amount of the benefit received from the corrupt act, but not more than twice that amount.

Good outcomes in nutrition, health, and education are development goals in themselves, because they directly improve people's lives. But they also equip people for productive employment and job opportunities--and through this channel, human capital drives economic and social advances. There is robust evidence from throughout the world that an additional year of schooling raises earnings substantially, and that this earnings premium reflects the higher productivity of more educated workers.84 Together, nutrition, health, and education combine to form human skills and abilities that have been powerfully linked to productivity growth and poverty reduction in the medium to longer run.85 Also, better health brings, directly, higher labor productivity. As such, human capital is a fundamental ingredient for desirable job outcomes.

Underemployment and low earnings , rather than open unemployment , are the challenges most people face in agrarian economies .	In this context, the notion of unemployment needs to be interpreted with caution. Unemployment rates can technically be computed, but given the prevalence of poverty in agrarian economies, a substantive share of the labor force is unlikely to remain idle for long. Underemployment and low earnings, rather than open unemployment, are the challenges most people face in agrarian economies. Household survey data from Mozambique show that an astounding 81 percent of those at work were living on less than US$1.25 a day in 2003, and 95 percent were living on less than US$2.00 a day.4 In agrarian economies, the main avenues to improving living standards involve increasing productivity in farming, creating a dynamic economic environment in cities, and promoting labor reallocation from rural to urban areas, thereby sparking a positive spiral of productivity growth and improvement in living standards. Together, these approaches should lead to the expansion of off-farm employment opportunities, which are in turn an important driver of poverty reduction.	Underemployment and low earnings, rather than open unemployment, are the challenges most people face in agrarian economies.	World Development Report 2013: Jobs	World Bank	2012

People living at a distance greater than a 30-minute round trip from their water source ( whether improved or not ) were assumed to have access to inadequate water source .	The distribution of deaths due to inadequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by sex was different in each of the two regions. Female deaths represented 49percent of the total share in Africa and 59percent in South-East Asia (which includes India as the most populous country in that WHO region).17 These differences could be explained by specific regional sex and age distributions of all deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases. In Africa, death rates were either similar for females and males or slightly higher for males because of the general higher biological vulnerability and mortality for boys and men (see Chapter 2 on Health). In South-East Asia, however, the female mortality rates were higher than the male rates, both in childhood and at older ages (figure 7.1). Although the mortality rate declined 13 Estimates of populations with access to adequate drinking water differ from populations with access to improved water sources. People living at a distance greater than a 30-minute round trip from their water source (whether improved or not) were assumed to have access to inadequate water source. In addition, household water filtering and boiling drinking water were used as a proxy for further improvement beyond currently available improved water sources. Source: Pruss-Ustun and others, 2014. 14 Inadequate sanitation refers to unimproved sanitation as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. 15 Pruss-Ustun and others, 2014. 16 ibid. 17 WHO, 2014c. in the past decade for both females and males, sex differences persisted and increased even further among older persons (figure 7.1).

Through INVIMA (Colombia's sanitary authority, analogous to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Resolution 719 of 2015, Colombia has assigned risk categories to foods with a view to imposing new requirements on foods depending on the category of risk. While Colombia has indicated it intends to apply the envisioned categories to both imported and domestic products, the United States is concerned about the criteria that Colombia uses to assign risk. The United States continues to engage with Colombia and affected stakeholders regarding the impact of these requirements. Ministry of Health Decree 539 of 2014 included numerous new requirements for high-risk foods, including plant registration with INVIMA and the inspection of facilities intending to export to Colombia. In January 2017, Colombia notified a draft regulation to the WTO that would amend Decree 539 by introducing a provision that allows for the recognition of the food safety systems of trading partners with which Colombia has free trade agreements, thereby exempting U.S. federally regulated establishments from individual inspection and approval requirements. The United States welcomed the prospective addition of this provision to Decree 539, but Colombia has yet to issue the final amended measure.

During detention, the women were often beaten by law enforcement officials and state security agents dressed as civilians. In January, Danilo Maldonado Machado, known as El Sexto, was released from a maximum security prison. He had been arrested in November 2016, hours after the announcement of Fidel Castro's death, for having written Se fue (""He's gone"") on a wall in the capital, Havana.1 In August, Yulier Perez, a graffiti artist known for painting dilapidated walls in Havana, was arbitrarily detained after months of intimidation and harassment from the authorities for freely expressing himself through his art.2 ."

"Part I Chapter 2 provides an overview of global data and trends on international migrants (stocks) and international migration (flows). It also provides a discussion of particular migrant groups - namely, migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons and stateless persons - as well as of remittances. In addition, the chapter refers to the existing body of IOM programmatic data, particularly on missing migrants, assisted voluntary returns and reintegration, resettlement, displacement tracking and human trafficking. While these data are generally not global or representative, they can provide insights into changes that have occurred in relevant IOM programming and operations globally. 13WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 Following the global overview, chapter 3 provides a discussion of key regional dimensions of, and developments in, migration. The discussion focuses on six world regions as identified by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America, and Oceania. For each of these regions, the analysis includes: i) an overview and brief discussion of key population-related statistics; and ii) succinct descriptions of ""key features and developments"" in migration in the region, based on a wide range of data, information and analyses, including from international organizations, researchers and analysts.

"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month? Such are the questions you will encounter when calculating your personal Ecological Footprint online. At the end of the quiz, you are presented with the number of global hectares needed to support your given lifestyle. This number is then converted into how many planet Earths would infobox: Footprint calculator There are many different Footprint calculators available, on vast numbers of Web sites."

Annex1 : Socio-economics, Gender and Policy Projects - 61 - Knowledge of methods used in conducting economic analysis was gained through the use of the new software and interactive exchange visits to Alabama and Bulgaria. Plans for producing publications were developed. The PIs jointly arrived at the realization that analytical tools necessary for this project would need to be rebuilt based on assumptions appropriate for a noncentrally controlled economy. Also, assumptions relative to farm unit size and managerial capabilities of the new farm owners would need to be retooled. Hence, technology transfer and technology transformation would result from the CRSP endeavor. ENEA was enabled to inaugurate better collection and use of farm level data, including the use of coding and data entry. This process became repeatable on a yearly basis and the focus shifted to a more rigorous system of data analysis. This new capability at data management has been used to increase the production of technical papers to disseminate the results. The papers encompass a range of topics, including the impact of technical innovation through new varieties, the pricing and marketing of agricultural products (peanut), optimizing farm planning and poverty levels, technical efficiencies in peanut production/processing, and a range of descriptive analyses. On the U.S. side of the technical benefits/achievements ledger, there were several outcomes: The University of Connecticut (UCONN) PI and his assistants gained additional experience in collecting, managing and analyzing data in situations with developing country conditions imposed. Other faculty at UCONN gained experience from working with and exposure to richer socio-economic data from the developing country setting.

As of February 2014, unemployment affects 6.7 percent of individuals in the labor force, and is more prevalent among the more educated in urban areas. A limited number of individuals hold nonagricultural wage jobs (19.9 percent of the employed population), and less than half of them have formal wage jobs, which are concentrated among the more educated in urban areas. In contrast, the majority of individuals are employed in agricultural or nonagricultural self-employment (47.5 percent, respectively 29.7 percent of the employed population).

In addition to this , local structures need to take account of local specificities and contexts ; they play an important role in translating and adapting national policies into locally palatable and effective measures and represent a crucial connective resource especially in countries with multiple ethnicities and local languages .	As the COVID-19 crisis disproportionately affects women and girls (see Section 5.2 on GESI), the response needs to be gendered and women and girls should participate in the decisions that affect them, as is their right. Although women are on the frontlines of the crisis in their homes, communities, and healthcare facilities, they are often excluded from national and community decision-making processes and governance structures that determine the response. Research finds that women leaders have been more successful in reducing transmission than their male counterparts (Social Europe, 2020) yet female leadership is low globally. We do not have full information for the Maintains countries, but in Kenya there are six women in the 21-person NERC on Coronavirus (29%), in Pakistan there is one woman in the 13-person Emergency Core Committee (8%), and in Uganda an analysis of four districtlevel COVID-19 task forces found that women made up 22.5% of members on average, and that men held the most influential positions. This low level of representation means that these committees are less likely to consider women's and men's different experiences when shaping responses which is expected to deepen gender inequality. (c) Maintains 33 Close and effective coordination at national, provincial, district, and local levels While clear direction, policy choices, and central management of the crisis are paramount, delivery can only occur at local level. Local institutions and structures provide additional structures, networks, and relationships with which to reach the population, and important resources which can be critical in implementing key policies - such as quarantine and ensuring that those in quarantine have access to food.

Ansar et al. (2016) examine the benefit/cost ratios of Chinese investments (within China) using detailed project data. They report results on 95 transport infrastructure projects (road and rail) built in China between 1984 and 2008 and compare these to 806 transport projects built in advanced economies. Data on 24 variables are collected for each investment, including cost variables, time aspects (decision, implementation and completion), competitiveness of the procurement process, proportion of foreign exchange costs, and benefits (such as freight usage). Their findings were as follows:  There is a tendency to underestimate project costs in China--actual costs, on average, are 30.6% higher than the final business case estimates (i.e. excluding preparation time) in real terms (removing the effects of inflation). This was particularly so in rail projects. Preliminary evidence suggests (since the size of projects could not be controlled for) that these overruns are not significantly different, statistically, compared to a rich democracies sample.  Projects in China were found to be finished with less time overruns than in advanced economies. However, they also find that this is associated with trading off quality, safety, social equity and the environment. These are outcomes that will need to be changed in order for China to meet its stated environmental objectives for the BRI.  With respect to benefits in traffic performance, the study finds evidence of poor resource allocation. The majority of routes have poor traffic volumes, while some have the opposite problem of extreme congestion.

The summit participants were accommodated in lodgings that are typical for the National Park's partner conservation programs in Benin, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Vietnam, Siberia, the Czech Republic, and Mongolia. Within 10 days in the International Wilderness Camp, the young people developed the political messages and creative artistic contributions that were introduced above. But the Footprint was not only a central theme during the Youth Summit. Just like other overarching topics such as climate change and resource consumption, it forms a regular part of the weeklong educational programs for school classes and youth groups. These take place in the country cabins of the International Wilderness Camp. The students, who live in the traditional dwellings, try to understand the topics from the perspectives of their ""host countries"" or the conservation areas which are partners of the Bavarian Forest National Park. The central questions of the week-long program, which is conceived for students in their 10th to 13th school year, are: What is behind the idea of the Footprint? How large is our country's Footprint and those of other countries? What does this all have to do with nature preservation and conservation areas? What role does each of us play in this? ""Living well within the means of one planet"" - Is this at all possible? If yes, how? The ""Chair Metaphor"", the ""Loop Game"" or the ""Quotation Line"" serve as educational starting points."

Broadening the finance options available and accessible to SMEs is a key challenge for policy makers in the quest for fostering their development and sustaining the most dynamic enterprises , in a credit constrained environment .	445. Broadening the finance options available and accessible to SMEs is a key challenge for policy makers in the quest for fostering their development and sustaining the most dynamic enterprises, in a credit constrained environment. It also represents a long-term challenge to improving the SMEs' capital structure and investment capacity, and reducing their over-reliance - and vulnerability - to the traditional lending channels. 446. The OECD-wide project on New Approaches to Economic Challenges (NAEC), presented at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in May 2014, underscores the need for the financial system to return to fulfilling its essential role of intermediation and providing the necessary capital for productive activities (OECD, 2014e). The present report provides an overview of alternative instruments for SME external finance over the broad risk/return spectrum and suggests that there exist opportunities to tap increasingly complex and interconnected financial markets to service the needs of a highly heterogeneous SME sector. The report highlights an increasing range of financing options for the different needs of SMEs over their life cycle, although some of these options are still at an early stage of development or, in their current form, are accessible only to a small share of the SME population.

The proposed regulations would prescribe the labeling requirements for prepackaged foods to display essential information on where the food is manufactured , processed , served , and stored .	In 2018, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) proposed a set of regulations called the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, which is an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006. The proposed regulations would prescribe the labeling requirements for prepackaged foods to display essential information on where the food is manufactured, processed, served, and stored. The proposed regulation also allows FSSAI to establish an internal mechanism to address problems arising out of the implementation and/or interpretation of the regulations. The government of India mandated standard retail package sizes for 19 categories of foods and beverages effective November 1, 2012, via an amendment to the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. This rule has not been notified to the WTO, nor was there a specific public comment period for domestic stakeholders prior to implementation. As the United States does not impose specific standards for packaging size, and U.S. package sizes tend to be in English rather than metric units, the list of package sizes prevents many U.S.-origin products from entering India. Attempts to import such U.S.-origin products have resulted in rejection at the port of entry. These standards have a negative effect on trade, with numerous U.S. brands effectively excluded from the Indian market. The United States continues to raise FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 241 concerns about these standards in various bilateral and multilateral fora in an effort to ensure that U.S. products have access to the Indian market.

The increase in drug trafficking has been accompanied not only by growing illicit drug use , especially among younger people , but also by increasing activities of organized criminal groups .	299. Africa continues to be one of the main transit areas for drug trafficking. West Africa is regularly used by traffickers to smuggle cocaine and other drugs into Europe. Furthermore, North Africa remains a primary source of drugs entering Europe, while East Africa is increasingly being used as a trafficking hub for Afghan heroin destined for Europe. The latter development is evidenced by the fact that East African countries and certain European countries have reported annual growth in seizures of heroin of African origin. This may be a reason for the increased abuse of heroin in East Africa. 300. Traffickers in search of new illicit markets for cocaine and heroin have targeted the nascent middle class in certain African countries, such as Benin, which has been used as a transit country for many decades, and Namibia, a transit country that is becoming a consumer country. Drug trafficking in West Africa may have an impact on the abuse of certain types of drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants, in the subregion. 301. The increase in drug trafficking has been accompanied not only by growing illicit drug use, especially among younger people, but also by increasing activities of organized criminal groups. In West and Central Africa, organized crime continues to contribute to social and economic costs by increasing drug trafficking and addiction and by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of comparatively few well-armed criminals. 302. Although the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has made efforts to counter the impact of drug trafficking and abuse in West Africa, there has been an overall increase in drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe using Africa as a transit area. The increase in illicit drug use in West Africa has resulted in challenges related to security, treatment and negative health and social consequences of that drug use. 303. According to South African law enforcement authorities, drug trafficking organizations from China and the Balkans have established a significant presence in Southern Africa. In addition to importing drugs directly into Southern Africa, drug trafficking organizations ship drugs to Maputo, and from there the drugs are transported by truck to South Africa.	The increase in drug trafficking has been accompanied not only by growing illicit drug use, especially among younger people, but also by increasing activities of organized criminal groups.

Challenges are also evident in relation to heroin and cocaine manufacture. Especially in the case of cocaine manufacture, the chemicals and processes now being used increase manufacturing efficiency and reduce the amount of chemicals required. With regard to the sources of the chemicals used, there are still significant information gaps. What seems to be clear, however, is that the majority of those chemicals are either sourced from within the country of drug manufacture or are sourced from another country within the same region and then smuggled to the country of manufacture. For example, more than 80 per cent of potassium permanganate, the key oxidizer used in illicit cocaine manufacture, and more than 90 per cent of solvents originate within the country of seizure.19 For acetic anhydride, the key chemical for heroin manufacture, available data suggest that more than 80 per cent of the substance can be traced to other countries within the same region.20 Further, there have been no reports of the diversion of potassium permanganate or acetic anhydride from international trade in more than five years. 266. Other developments posing a challenge for precursor control efforts at the national, regional and international levels are a consequence of the improvements in global communication, transportation and trade facilitation. An area of increasing concern is the growth of free trade zones and free ports, which often lack sufficient transparency. Another fact of modern life is the increase in the number and geographic extent of trade and customs unions.

In Benin, Mali, South Sudan and Togo, the gap is wider between women (both with and without disabilities) and men, but narrower between women with and without disabilities.

Through private equity , wealthy individuals , investment funds or institutions participate fully in the entrepreneurial risk of the business , as capital is made available without provision of security .	"332. Private equity financing includes a broad range of external financing instruments, whereby the enterprise obtains funds from private sources in exchange for an ownership stake of the firm. The capital is provided to private companies, i.e. companies whose shares are not freely tradable in any public stock market, across the entire life cycle, from seed financing to buyouts (OECD, 2009). 333. Through private equity, wealthy individuals, investment funds or institutions participate fully in the entrepreneurial risk of the business, as capital is made available without provision of security. Compared to other forms of external finance, the investor accepts more risk and expects a higher return, typically above 25% IRR (internal rate of return) (see Table 6). 334. The investment is open-ended, though equity investors generally provide capital over a mediumto long-term horizon (3-10 years). The objective of investors is to make profit by ""exiting"" (i.e. selling their shares through an IPO, a trade sale or buyback by the other shareholders) once the firm has increased its share value. 335. Private equity investments are less volatile than those in the stock market. Trading does not have an impact on the asset class, as assets are held until maturity and valued on the basis of corporate fundamentals rather than depending on market fluctuations. The lower sensitivity to market variations provides investors a form of protection against equity market downturn and enables them to have stable and attractive returns. For instance, in Europe, since 2001, returns in the private equity segment have outperformed those in public equity markets by 9.4%. The 2008-09 financial crisis further widened the gap return between these markets (Idinvest, 2014). 336. Private equity is divided into two distinct components, namely venture capital, targeted at new and early stage companies, and other private equity, such as growth capital and buyouts, targeted at mature businesses (see Table 6)39. Buyouts, whereby shares are bought from existing shareholders and control of 38 Initial Public Offering: sale or distribution of a company's shares to the public for the first time (OECD, 2009). 39 For a review of definitions by selected venture capital associations, see OECD (2014)."

They are complementary to measures to achieve conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity outside protected areas in accordance with CBD guidelines such as the Malawi and Addis Ababa Principles ( CBD VII / 11-12 ) .	Guidelines for applying protected area management categories Protected areas Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation. They are the cornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation strategies, set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or endemic species from becoming extinct. They are complementary to measures to achieve conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity outside protected areas in accordance with CBD guidelines such as the Malawi and Addis Ababa Principles (CBD VII/11-12). Most protected areas exist in natural or near-natural ecosystems, or are being restored to such a state, although there are exceptions. Many contain major features of earth history and earth processes while others document the subtle interplay between human activity and nature in cultural landscapes. Larger and more natural protected areas also provide space for evolution and future ecological adaptation and restoration, both increasingly important under conditions of rapid climate change.

Conflict environments range from situations with high levels of criminal violence to The labor productivity of workers in well-managed firms in Ethiopia is comparable with that in China and Vietnam, although wages are only a quarter of those in China and half those in Vietnam. Ethiopia thus has the potential to compete globally in apparel thanks to a significant and growing labor cost advantage. It is also close to a state-of-the-art and well-located container port in Djibouti and has duty-free access to the markets of the European Union and the United States. The binding constraint on Ethiopia's competitiveness in apparel is poor trade logistics, which wipe out its labor cost advantage and cut the country off from the higher-value time-sensitive segments of the market. Establishing a fast-track channel for moving apparel through customs, providing free and immediate access to foreign exchange, reducing the cost of letters of credit, and setting up an industrial zone closer to Djibouti would alleviate the most important trade logistics bottlenecks. These steps would also put Ethiopia in a position to attract investors to lead the industry in the same way that China and Vietnam have done.

Linking the National Footprint Accounts with Ecosystem Services The notion that the human economy is a subset of the surrounding ecology is integral to identifying the economic linkages between nature, human activities, and biodiversity. Various initiatives are currently underway to analyze the economic benefits of biodiversity and weigh the costs of effective policies against resulting deceleration of biodiversity loss. One of the more ambitious projects is the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which categorizes three types of ecosystem services: (1) provisioning (e.g. of food, fresh water, wood and fiber, fuel, etc.), (2) regulating (e.g. climate regulation, flood regulation, disease regulation, water purification, etc.), and (3) cultural (e.g. aesthetic, spiritual, educational, recreational, etc.) (MA 2005). In this context, the biocapacity and Ecological Footprint indicators focus on the biomass-based flows of the ecosystem's provisioning services and the waste uptake of its regulating services. Examples of the services quantified in the National Footprint Accounts include provisioning of food, fiber, and timber, and uptake of carbon dioxide by forests and oceans.

This inverse relationship between farm size and productivity was first observed in South Asia.27 But it has also emerged in Sub-Saharan Africa as population pressure on the land has led to agricultural intensification. In Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, a 1 percent increase in farm size is associated with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent reduction in yield.28 The use of family labor per hectare is also inversely correlated with farm size.29 The relationship between crop yields and farm size emerges, because the larger, more mechanized farms have higher productivity. But in the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia and 39 percent in Chile. In services sectors, their role is often more important. Even in Eastern European countries, where private sector entry is only two decades old, microenterprises account for 10 to 20 percent of employment in manufacturing and for 30 to 50 percent of employment in services. Micro-and small enterprises also play a critical role in job creation and destruction (box 3.2).26 In farms, uneven technological progress It is generally assumed that large farms are more productive. In low-income countries, however, In some household and labor force surveys, employees are asked to report the size of the firm they work for, or the size of their own business if they are self-employed.

This distribution can in turn be used to correct for the omission of informal enterprises in an economic census or plant-level survey.

Moving beyond economic outcomes, Silvia Maja Melzer and Ruud J. Muffels spoke to the growing literature on migration and happiness, using German panel data to examine subjective wellbeing in connection with east-west migration after reunification.

Also in October , 37 police officers , serving in the Lunigiana area in northern Tuscany , were charged in relation to numerous cases of personal injury and other abuses .	In July, Italy finally introduced legislation criminalizing torture, having ratified the Convention against Torture in 1989. However, in December, the Committee against Torture noted that the definition of torture in the new law was not in line with the Convention. The new law also failed to provide for the implementation of other key provisions, including the reviewing of interrogation policies and provision of redress to victims. In September, the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) published the report of its visit to Italy in April 2016. The CPT received allegations of ill-treatment, including unnecessary and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials and prison officers in virtually all detention facilities it visited. The CPT noted that overcrowding persisted, despite recent reforms. In October, the European Court of Human Rights found that the treatment of 59 people by police and medical staff during their detention, following the protests against the 2001 Genoa G8 summit, amounted to torture. Also in October, 37 police officers, serving in the Lunigiana area in northern Tuscany, were charged in relation to numerous cases of personal injury and other abuses. Many of these abuses were against foreign nationals, on two occasions involving the use of electric batons. The trial was pending at the end of the year.

CHWs can incur out-of-pocket expenditures for communication and transport ; ensuring timely and complete payment of incentives to compensate for this was reported to be most important .	Qualitative studies were included to provide insights with respect to the perceived consequences of various payment and remuneration approaches. Most qualitative studies described positive attitudes towards financial payments (136-142). Financial incentives in general appear to be well accepted, provide motivation and recognition, and may bring a sense of financial independence and self-confidence to CHWs. CHWs can incur out-of-pocket expenditures for communication and transport; ensuring timely and complete payment of incentives to compensate for this was reported to be most important. The reputation of the CHW, as based on trust and respect from the community, can be negatively impacted by performance-based incentive schemes, which were described as at times being too narrowly focused on pre-identified indicators, leading to activities and efforts not linked to these indicators being ignored and unacknowledged. Performance-based incentives encouraged uneven focus on certain activities due to their association with higher incentives, especially when CHWs had no basic remuneration, leading to the neglect of other important activities or responsibilities. Other CHWs expressed dissatisfaction with performance-based incentive models in relation to amounts paid and inconsistent and incomplete payment of incentives (45, 143). The systematic review team rated the overall certainty of the evidence as very low.

Maintaining a stable supply of basic staples ( through production or imports ) at affordable prices for the poor , while maintaining incentives for production growth for farmers , is a key element in sustaining food security .	Food security means access by all people at all times to adequate food required to live an active, healthy life. Its essential elements are both availability of food and the ability of the people to acquire it. National self-sufficiency in food may not ensure food security because the poor may not have enough income to buy adequate food. India, for example, is self-sufficient in rice because it does not need to import it. Yet, onethird of the Indian population cannot afford to buy basic food.

The Peanut CRSP is addressing the whole value chain of an important food and cash crop and this should continue in the future. The holistic approach contributed to the success of the program relative to the resources provided by USAID and it facilitated the leveraging of funds by U.S.A. and host country participating institutions. 3. Food safety/health and nutrition research should be of high priority due to its high potential for global impacts on health and well-being of people, but is more costly than traditional agriculture programs. Hence, higher funding level is needed for this important research area that is pioneered by Peanut CRSP, and that bridges health and agriculture concerns. 4. The future program should include the full range of production, post-harvest, utilization, and market development projects in each host country or region to insure that product value-addition is addressed early and that the producers also benefit through better market elasticity. 5. Socio-economic projects should cut across all projects to ensure inclusion of research to provide baseline information for later impact analyses, economic viability of technologies, policy interventions, market information, and risk management for improved decision-making. It is recommended that to continue the progress towards achieving the goal of better gender equity, adequate resources to plan, monitor, and evaluate social and gender concerns within and across projects.. 6. Information exchange and networking mechanisms, collaboration with other research stakeholders, and training should continue as core functions of the program. Management should continue to promote collaboration and efficient use of resources within the program. 7.

A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).	Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas.

In terms of agricultural self-employment, farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively well endowed with land and fairly market-oriented. Four in five smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in five reporting to sell their complete harvest. In other words, most farmers engage with the market and have moved well beyond farming for subsistence only (Table 1.6). Close to 30 percent of households reported selling 100 percent of their agricultural production. This includes the sale of food and cash crops. As such, the data suggest that the vast majority of selling households are growing and marketing both cash and food crops, while very few of them specialize in food crops or subsistence agriculture. Around half of selling households are producing (and selling) both cash and food crops. Those focusing only on the production and sale of cash crops represent 32.7 percent.

Critical checkpoints for the industry Despite improvements across region , subregion and income level , a number of challenges remain for the T & T industry .	Critical checkpoints for the industry Despite improvements across region, subregion and income level, a number of challenges remain for the T&T industry. First, given the forecasted growth in T&T in the coming decade, far more investment is required in infrastructure in order to build capacity to welcome more visitors while adequately serving the needs of citizens. For example, despite the growth in air travel and openness, global average perceptions of air transport infrastructure quality have improved at a far slower rate (at a global average 1.4% and 0.4% for high-income economies since the last report), and airport density statistics have fallen. In addition, while some progress has been made in improving ground and port infrastructure, especially in Asia-Pacific, the overall growth trend for Ground and Port Infrastructure (pillar 11) has been slower. Furthermore, from a global perspective, perceptions of the quality and efficiency of ground transport infrastructure and services have on average remained near stagnant. Consequently, the risk of future air and ground transport bottlenecks is likely to rise, hurting both the industry and local economies.

Certain FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 267 exporters and importers are granted a limited exception in the event that there is limited availability of Indonesian owned maritime transport or insurance companies .	"The 2014 Insurance Law requires all insurance companies to incorporate locally and limits foreign investment in domestic insurance companies to the acquisition of publicly traded shares. Private equity purchases of company stock are not allowed, though the 2014 Insurance Law exempts joint ventures predating the law where foreign ownership was acquired through private equity means. The Insurance Law does not contain an explicit limitation on foreign equity ownership, but called for the MOF to issue such a regulation. In May 2018, Indonesia issued Government Regulation 14/2018 (""GR 14/2018"") limiting foreign equity in insurance companies at 80 percent. GR 14/2018 exempts companies with foreign ownership higher than 80 percent at the time of the GR 14/2018's issuance, but limits these companies' foreign ownership to their May 2018 levels and requires new capital injections to comply with the 80 percent foreign/20 percent domestic ownership rule. Additionally, for these exempted companies, GR 14/2018 includes a ""ratchet"" provision that lowers the permitted level of foreign ownership if the percentage of foreign ownership falls. OJK Regulation 14/2015 and OJK Circular Letter 31/2015 require insurance companies operating in Indonesia to cede to domestic reinsurance companies 100 percent of the reinsurance for certain products (such as vehicle, accident, health, and life insurance). OJK also requires mandatory domestic cessions of up to 50 percent for other insurance lines, such as certain property and casualty policies. The United States has raised concerns over mandatory cession requirements for reinsurance and will continue to engage with Indonesia on this matter. MOT Regulation 82/2017 requires exporters of coal and crude palm oil, importers of rice, and importers of items for government procurement to use Indonesian national shipping and insurance companies. Certain FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 267 exporters and importers are granted a limited exception in the event that there is limited availability of Indonesian owned maritime transport or insurance companies. In July 2018, MOT issued Regulation 80/2018 postponing implementation of the domestic shipping requirement until May 1, 2020 and of the national insurance requirement until February 1, 2019."

Payment-based private supplementary tutoring has also spread all over the world , both in developed and developing countries-from east to the west .	Abstract Private tutoring in English is a major phenomenon in Bangladesh. A large number of students receive private supplementary tutoring in English in Bangladesh. Payment-based private supplementary tutoring has also spread all over the world, both in developed and developing countries-from east to the west. The aim of this study is to find out the reasons and necessity of private tutoring in English for Bangla medium school students in Bangladesh. Besides, It will be also investigated that private tutoring has any positive effects or not. To conduct this research, thirty five respondents were surveyed successfully with a written questionnaire. And classroom observation was done successfully to find out where there was any lacking in English teaching or not. The findings from the survey show that most of the primary level learners receive private tutoring and they are satisfied with the English lesson provided by their private tutor rather than their school teacher. But learners should not fully depend on private tutor. Private tuition has both positive and negative effects. Parents and learners should recognize the importance of private tutoring in English and also be aware about negative effects of it.

Thai Aid, the Thai Government's Development Aid Agency, has a program to assist developing countries in the region, such as Timor-Leste, through its Thai International Cooperation Program (TICP). Thai Aid could leverage Peanut-CRSP funding and future training on peanut could be funded through the TICP Program in the other collaborating countries. Peanut CRSP scientists and the Management Entity should support the Thai Project Team to pursue this opportunity. Kasetsart University-KAPI could access the Small-and Medium Enterprises Fund from the Ministry of Industry to support training activities. The objective is to train staff from private industry for 10-15 days on processing technologies and on good industry practices. The experience in partnering with private food companies using the Industry Incubator Model, developed in the Philippines in collaboration with Peanut CRSP, would be useful for the Thai trainers involved in this project. Training of South East Asian Scientists: An international training course on Peanut Processing and -Uutilization Technologies was held in September 2003. Participants included 13 scientists (6 women and 7 men) from 9 countries: Bulgaria (2), Cambodia (2), Indonesia (1), Lao PDR (1), Malaysia (1), Mayanmar (1), Philippines (2), Thailand (2), and Timor-Leste (1). Similar topics, as the Thai nationals training, were covered, including the use of Eliza kits to detect aflatoxin in peanut. The trainees visited villages where Peanut CRSP technology transfer activities were ongoing (Nakornrachasrima and Udorn Thanee Villages, Khon Kaen), and Suwan Research Farm where peanut experiments were conducted. Exposure to actual field/village situation facilitated the learning process and allowed the participants to meet with village processors and extension workers. Participants in the international training, held in 2003, paid their own travel cost and hotel accommodation. The project provided training materials and other costs such as transport to the village, etc. This allowed the project to stretch the limited fund from Peanut CRSP.

Nevertheless , the Cambodian garment industry has continued to invest in monitoring , having identified labor compliance as an important part of its claim to a niche in the global garment industry .	Better Work is modeled on the Better Factories Cambodia program, which was introduced in conjunction with the bilateral trade agreement between Cambodia and the United States. Results of evaluations of Better Factories Cambodia, covering more than 90 percent of participating factories, found that compliance on occupational safety and health improved 20 percent. Correct payment of wages, overtime, and benefits increased 37 percent. Initially, incentives to improve working conditions were driven by the quota increases called for under the trade agreement; however, with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), quota increases were no longer possible. Nevertheless, the Cambodian garment industry has continued to invest in monitoring, having identified labor compliance as an important part of its claim to a niche in the global garment industry. This niche exists despite the expiration of the MFA largely because of the role that reputation plays in the supply chain. 308 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 proposals in the Doha agenda and in regional trade discussions offer prospects for significant liberalization (figure 9.7). 102 However, the productivity gains from services liberalization would be substantial. Electricity, finance, telecommunications, and trade have a direct impact on production and transaction costs, making downstream sectors more competitive. By boosting job creation and raising labor earnings, these productivity gains should also lead to improved living standards. Social impacts can be more mixed. They are clearly positive when cell phones connect people (especially the poor) to markets for their products, to employment opportunities, or to government services. They can be negative when the disappearance of retail trade leads to the decline of traditional urban areas and affects the livelihoods of older shopkeepers who may not find alternative employment easily.

In Bangladesh, English was introduced during British rule and still enjoys a position of dominance and prestige (Hamid, Sussex & Khan, 2009, p.284). English is taught as a compulsory subject from the first to the 12th grade and also at the tertiary level in Bangladesh.

This chapter has highlighted the disparities in learning outcomes that impede overall progress on learning, and the importance of having a systems approach to improving learning. Across the 10 countries with PASEC data, 45 percent of the overall disparity among students in learning outcomes is explained by the variations in the performance of the schools they attend. In particular, disparities among schools, where some do not impart the basics, suggest a key emphasis for learning policies in certain contexts.

Trainers at Kasetsart University have already good experience in training on legumes when they starting the peanut training. Courses were carried out at three levels: (1) international/regional that focused on Southeast Asian scientists, (2) national level for Thai researchers and extension workers, and (3) village level for owners of micro-and small-scale enterprises involving whole villages. Planning and implementation of training courses involved many institutions besides Kasetsart University: other Thai universities such as Khon Kaen University, the Agricultural Extension Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Farmers' and Women's Associations, development projects such as the Thai Princess' Project, other donors such as FAO and USAID, and other stakeholders. The main topics for training were new/improved processing techniques, especially to remove aflatoxin contamination in whole kernels, and use of Elisa technique, a quick method to detect aflatoxin contamination. Participants also learned how to process improved traditional and new peanut products. During the international and national training, Kasetsart University trainors used on-site training methods by bringing the trainees to the villages to experience actually processing of peanut products with village-level micro-and small-scale processors. Overall evaluation of training courses has not been completed, although an impact study of six training workshops held in 2002 is ongoing to determine the impact of training on former participants.

Complex modelling is used to produce global and regional estimates of morbidity and mortality, often based on partial information on exposure, a few case studies on the relationship between exposure and health effects, and cause of death information confined to a limited number of countries, mostly from developed regions. Gender is not consistently integrated at every step of the statistical modelling (mainly due to limited availability of statistical information disaggregated by sex) and the results obtained are not systematically assessed from a gender perspective.

Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of oneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer's perspective.

Additional forms of harmful traditional practices were identified and a recommendation was made for the formation of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children .	In 1960, the issue of FGM was debated at the Seminar on the Participation of Women in Public Life, held at Addis Ababa for the African region. Concluding remarks included a call to WHO to make a statement condemning all forms of medicalization of FGM. In its resolution 821 II (XXXII), adopted in July 1961, ECOSOC again invited WHO to study the medical aspects of operations based on customs. A seminar convened in 1979 by the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Khartoum marked a milestone in the campaign against harmful traditional practices, setting the pace and direction for international and national plans of action. Additional forms of harmful traditional practices were identified and a recommendation was made for the formation of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children. In addition, the seminar reiterated the concluding remarks made at the 1960 seminar and urged Governments to collaborate with international bodies in a concerted effort to eliminate these practices.

High unemployment and skills mismatches are often attributed to shortcomings in education and training systems .	Skills or jobs--what comes first? The conventional wisdom is that investing in skills will lead to job creation and to higher productivity and labor income. High unemployment and skills mismatches are often attributed to shortcomings in education and training systems. But in reality they can also result from market distortions, which send the wrong signals to the education system or lead to a lack of dynamism in private firms. In such situations, massive investments in training systems, as seen in many parts of the world, might show disappointing results as hoped-for job outcomes do not materialize.

The other workshops included: The Baltic/Nordic region (May 2001), MesoAmerica (June 2001), South America (October 2001), South and Southeast Asia (August 2002), the Austral Pacific region (October 2002), and West Africa (postponed to March 2004). Each meeting has resulted in a regional statement, meeting report (including draft regional action plans), and development or strengthening of regional directories of information resources on IAS. Representatives of the Southern African countries (including several small island States of the southwestern Indian Ocean) were invited to participate in the regional workshop in Zambia, together with a group of international IAS experts. The workshop was designed to meet three primary objectives, to: 1. Raise awareness of the IAS problem and opportunities to manage it; 2. Forge cooperation between nations and between economic and policy sectors (especially agriculture and environmental protection); and 3. Lay the groundwork for the development of a regional southern African IAS strategy.

Concerted conservation efforts began in Mauritius about 25 years ago with intensive species recovery programs for several bird species on the brink of extinction. Efforts in Rodrigues began in the early 1980s with a rare plant recovery program. These endeavors have since expanded to include other endangered vertebrate and plant species recovery programs, as well as intensive restoration efforts for mainland and islet sites of key biodiversity importance. The methods and impressive achievements of these programs are summarized below. The next step is to scale up conservation efforts while consolidating the gains made to date.

Health worker migration in response to the global shortage of health professionals demands dedicated and effective management, including building the capacity of health systems in origin countries, promotion of good practices and prevention of negative effects of health worker migration. There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.

Type D: Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities. This type includes two main subsets: (1) indigenous peoples' areas and territories established and run by indigenous peoples and (2) community conserved areas established and run by local communities. The subsets, which may not be neatly separated, apply to both sedentary and mobile peoples and communities. IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules. These can be relatively complex. For instance, land and/or sea resources may be collectively owned and managed while other resources may be managed individually or on a clan basis. Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times, or of different resources within the same area. Rules generally intertwine with cultural and spiritual values. The customary rules and organizations managing natural resources often possess no statutory legal recognition or sanctioning power. In other cases, however, indigenous peoples and/or local communities are fully recognised as the legitimate authority in charge of state-listed protected areas or have legal title to the land, water or resources. Whatever the structure, the governance arrangements require IUCN recognises four broad types of governance of protected areas, any of which can be associated with any management objective: A. Governance by government B. Shared governance C. Private governance D. Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities 3. Governance that the area under the control of indigenous peoples and/or local communities has identifiable institutions and regulations that are responsible for achieving the protected area objectives.

Grazing land is used to raise livestock for meat , dairy , hide , and wool products .	Globally in 2007, there were 3.4 billion hectares of land classified as grazing land. Grazing land is used to raise livestock for meat, dairy, hide, and wool products. The grazing land Footprint is calculated by comparing the amount of livestock feed available in a country with the amount of feed required for the livestock produced in that year, with the remainder of feed demand assumed to come from grazing land. Since the yield of grazing land represents the amount of above-ground primary production available in a year, overshoot is not physically possible over extended periods of time for this land use type.

In terms of agricultural self-employment, farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively well endowed with land and fairly market-oriented. Four in five smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in five reporting to sell their complete harvest. In other words, most farmers engage with the market and have moved well beyond farming for subsistence only (Table 1.6). Close to 30 percent of households reported selling 100 percent of their agricultural production. This includes the sale of food and cash crops. As such, the data suggest that the vast majority of selling households are growing and marketing both cash and food crops, while very few of them specialize in food crops or subsistence agriculture. Around half of selling households are producing (and selling) both cash and food crops. Those focusing only on the production and sale of cash crops represent 32.7 percent. Only 17.2 percent of selling households are growing and marketing only food crops. Unlike selling households, non-selling households are more specialized in food crops. Close to 47 percent of them grew food crops only.	This includes the sale of food and cash crops.

In Ceara state, torture by state officials was recurrent inside juvenile detention facilities. During the year, there were at least 20 riots and 37 escapes from units in Ceara. Out of 200 formal reports of torture of adolescents inside juvenile detention units in Ceara between 2016 and September 2017, only two reports resulted in a formal inquiry by the state for further investigation. Reports of the chaotic state of the juvenile justice system in Ceara resulted in a formal visit by Brazil's National Human Rights Council in September. Early in the year, Espirito Santo state held 1,198 juvenile detainees in a system with capacity for only 754, a rate of overcrowding of more than 39%. Of the state's 13 detention facilities, only four were operating within their intended capacity. On 3 June, seven boys aged between 15 and 17 were killed by other teenage detainees during a riot in a juvenile detention facility in Lagoa Seca, Paraiba state.

One of the most serious challenges includes the loss of state control to organized criminal groups. Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State, as well as the regional and global community. When state structures become involved with and affected by violence and systemic corruption, drug trafficking can further weaken the efficacy of Governments to the point of creating ""failed State"" conditions at the national or subregional level. Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid. 28. One of the most recent challenges to the international drug control system is that posed by the use of the Internet for drug trafficking. States must do more to enable the investigation of such illegal operations in order to ensure that such operations are identified, restricted and eliminated and that the international postal system is not used for illicit drug shipments. Internet pharmacies and other dispensing methods that physically separate the prescriber or provider from the patient pose a particular risk and require the development of more effective regulatory approaches. In such systems of supply, it is more difficult for prescribers and dispensers to evaluate the needs of patients to ensure that the prescriptions will be used for legitimate medical purposes so as to protect the health and well-being of the individual. States should be mindful of the challenges that such methods for the supply of medications may pose."

"In a poor neighborhood of Santiago de los Caballeros, the second-largest city in the Dominican Republic, only a few women sold clothes and sweets in the streets a decade ago. Many are now earning incomes from activities such as selling lottery tickets or running small clothing stores and beauty salons. The incomes of these women are vitally important to their families because men are struggling. Factory opportunities and other jobs associated with the city's free trade zone have been shrinking in recent years. Participants in a Santiago focus group said that women found work BOX 1.2 Jobs bring earnings opportunities to women, but also new difficulties more easily than men because employers have ""more confidence in them [the women]."" Increased labor force participation is not without challenges. The women in Santiago worry about their safety because of assaults, theft, and gang violence; many think it is too dangerous to work at night.

PROMER helped to create 240 enterprises, consolidate 665 enterprises, create 3,750 jobs, and teach 458 people to read. It usually takes enterprises 3 to 5 years to reach their full potential, and finding a niche in the economy can be critical for success. Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries. Apprentices trained informally by the baker opened 20 enterprises of their own and created about 84 jobs. Other rural enterprises were not as successful. Some developed products that succeeded in rural markets but not in urban markets because of high transport costs, poor marketing, or poor quality. Most entrepreneurs reported challenges in maintaining quality and continuous production. Rural enterprises had trouble finding an urban location in which to present their products, a result that highlights the problem of multiple constraints. Exhibitions have played a major role in bringing some rural products to a wider market, especially furniture, and have attracted better contracts that have led to modest job creation.

In the UK , the Angel CoFund invests amounts of GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million into SMEs with high growth potential , working in partnership with syndicates of experienced BAs .	Policies 405. Angel investing is increasingly encouraged and supported by policy makers in many countries, as a way to mobilize financial resources and entrepreneurial expertise towards dynamic new ventures. In most cases, supply-side measures have been introduced, which mainly take the form of tax incentives and public co-investment. Given the local dimension of angel investing, in some countries, such as the US and Canada, support is provided at the local level rather than at the national level. 47 see www.eban.org 406. Front-end and back-end tax incentives aim to increase the number of BAs as well as the amount of capital invested. Typically, incentives are conditional on the shares being held for a minimum number of years or the capital gains being reinvested in new ventures. For instance, in 2008, Italy introduced tax relief for business angel investments, which consists of a tax exemption for capital gains on the sale of a startups' undertakings, provided that the start-up is less than seven years old, that the investor holds the shares for at least three years, and that the capital gains are reinvested in another start-up in the next two years (OECD, 2014b). 407. Japan has introduced an angel tax system since 1997, which comprises reduced taxation on capital gains and carry forward of losses. However, as angel taxation was only used for a small amount of investments, to further increase angel funding, the system was amended in recent years with the introduction of an income exemption system, whereby, under specific conditions, BAs can deduct from their annual income an amount of money substantially equivalent to the investment carried out in the same year (OECD, 2011a). 408. Another common supply-side measure consists in the creation of co-investment funds, which match public funds with those of private investors that are approved under the scheme. In some cases these funds target all seed and early stage investors, including also VC funds (see Box 9), but there exists also programmes that are especially focused on BAs. In the UK, the Angel CoFund invests amounts of GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million into SMEs with high growth potential, working in partnership with syndicates of experienced BAs.

Women and the environment is one of the 12 critical areas of concern for achieving gender equality identified in the Beijing Platform for Action .	Women and the environment is one of the 12 critical areas of concern for achieving gender equality identified in the Beijing Platform for Action.1 The Platform for Action recognizes that environmental conditions have a different impact on the lives of women and men due to existing gender inequality. It also stresses that women's role in sustainable development is hampered by unequal access to economic resources, information and technology, and limited participation in policy formulation and decision-making in natural resources and environment management. This chapter examines the links between gender and the environment in two parts. The first part looks at three aspects of the environment that have different effects on the lives of women and men:2 access to water and sanitation, access to modern energy services, and exposure to natural hazards. It shows that the burden of work resulting from lack of access to clean water and energy falls mostly on the shoulders of women. In ad- 1 United Nations, 1995. 2 Other aspects of the environment that may have a different impact on the lives of women and men could not be analysed due to lack of data (see box 7.1). dition, exposure to inadequate water may result in higher mortality among women than men as a result of diarrhoea in contexts where access to health services remains unequal. Household air pollution resulting from the use of firewood and other solid fuels threatens the lives of women and men in many developing countries, but women are more exposed than men to indoor pollutants due to their role in cooking and caring for children and other family members. Gender roles may also worsen women's vulnerability during disasters and waste their potential as a source of resilience.

Throughout this chapter , nonagricultural household enterprises are defined as in Filmer et al. ( 2014 ) .	Operationally, in the case of Coted'Ivoire, existing literature on informality indicates that the country follows the ILO framework elaborated above. However, the predominant way to define informality is based on the registration criterion, and slightly less on the size criterion. Indeed, from both approaches (enterprise or labor), being in informality implies that the operating entity or employee is not registered with the Government Social Security Office (Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance Sociale or CNPS). The rationale is that registration with the social security office is generally the last administrative step to establish an enterprise or declaring an employee in Coted'Ivoire, while often preceding steps of formalization are juridical or fiscal natures (AGEPE 2011).

On 28 April, Tumelo Mohlomi, a student from the University of Lesotho was killed when she was shot in the back of the head by a Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) officer while she was in a restaurant outside the campus. A police officer was arrested after the killing and apparently released on bail. The victim's family brought a civil case of murder against the LMPS, which sought an out-of-court settlement. The National Police Commissioner said that a criminal investigation into the case was ongoing. In August the High Court ruled in favour of a habeas corpus application brought by the family of Mokalekale Khetheng who disappeared on 26 March 2016 after arrest on unspecified charges by four LMPS officers in Leribe District. In August, the police officers were arrested in connection with his murder; Mokalekale Khetheng's body was exhumed. The former Minister of Defence was then arrested in connection with the murder. He and the officers were also charged with conspiracy to cause a disappearance. The former Minister was released on bail in September. The former National Police Commissioner, who remained abroad throughout the year, was apparently implicated in the case although he was not charged. On 5 September, Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) Commander Khoantle Motsomotso was shot dead in his office at the LDF headquarters in the capital, Maseru. Two suspects in the killing, LDF members Brigadier Bulane Sechele and Colonel Tefo Hashatsi, also died in retaliatory fire. The Prime Minister announced an investigation into the incident.

Early Spanish settlers adopted this practice and brought it back to Europe .	Coca leaves are grown from bushes native to the Andes. The leaves contain alkaloids that can be extracted to produce commercial cocaine. The use of coca leaves has a long history. During the Incan Empire, they were chewed during religious rituals. Early Spanish settlers adopted this practice and brought it back to Europe. Many notable figures, such as Sigmund Freud, became regular users and active proponents of its ability to increase creativity and stamina, and decrease hunger. Freud supposedly began using it after hearing of the Belgian army's experiments in giving coca extracts to its soldiers, who performed better on less food over longer periods of time. The most famous legal use of coca is undoubtedly with the softdrink Coca-Cola, which initially contained marinated coca leaves. The softdrink was invented by Atlanta pharmacist Jon Pemberton as a stimulating beverage that served as a substitute for alcohol at a time when the sale of alcohol was illegal in Atlanta (Hobhouse, 2005, pp. 310-13). Today, cocaine is one of the most highly traded illegal substances in the world. Although the consumption of cocaine has spread to all corners of the globe, only three New World countries--Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia--produce the world's supply of coca leaves. In 2008, Colombia produced 62 percent, Peru produced 28 percent, and Bolivia produced 10 percent of the world's supply (U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008, p. 70). The coca industry accounts for asignificant portion of income in these countries. It is estimated that the coca leaf by itself accounts for 2.3 percent of Bolivia's GDP, and 16 percent of its total agricultural production (U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008, p. 233). In Colombia, a country with a much larger economy, the analogous numbers are smaller, but still significant: 0.5 and 5 percent (U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, 2009, p. 6).

"Understanding the links between environmental change and migration The mechanisms through which environmental impacts contribute to migration are complex.4 Over the last decade, it has become accepted that links between the environment and migration are rarely linear. Some literature frames the issue as a normal and neutral social process and other articles refer to the ""migrancy problematic"".5 Economic, political, cultural and demographic factors interact with environmental drivers to shape intentions of people to move or stay in a given location. These interactions can contribute to building 1 Robert Oakes, United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security; Soumyadeep Banerjee, International Organization for Migration; and Koko Warner, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat. 2 Nasem, 2016; IPCC, 2014. 3 Since the end of the twentieth century there have been estimates of the future numbers of people who will move due to climate change (Myers, 1993; Stern et al., 2006). While policy circles may embrace such estimates, academia has been critical of the assumptions necessary to produce models, in particular the lack of consideration given to non-migratory adaptation measures (Gemenne, 2011).

Frequent power outages , as well as poor road , port , rail , and aviation transportation infrastructure pose a major challenge to doing business in Nigeria .	Nigeria's investment climate continues to be characterized by significant market potential, but also by weak government institutions, corruption, regulatory uncertainty, inadequate infrastructure (especially electricity), security challenges, inadequate health care, poor education systems, and inadequate access to finance for small-and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. These barriers impede potential U.S. investment in Nigeria. Investors also must contend with complex tax procedures, confusing land ownership laws, arbitrary application of regulations, and crime. Companies report that contracts are often violated and that Nigeria's system for settling commercial disputes is weak and often biased. Frequent power outages, as well as poor road, port, rail, and aviation transportation infrastructure pose a major challenge to doing business in Nigeria. These factors hinder Nigeria's ability to compete in regional and international markets. The Nigerian government's efforts to reduce the amount of time, forms, and cost required to establish and operate a business contributed to the country's 24-place rise in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index in 2017, to 145 of 190 countries. However, the lack of further progress on reforms led to a one-place fall in 2018, to 146 of 190 countries. Foreign exchange restrictions have negatively impacted investment as well as trade. The measures have hampered some U.S. companies' abilities to import finished or semi-finished goods for use in their Nigerian operations. Similarly, the Central Bank of Nigeria has often restricted the repatriation of earnings, causing some businesses to close down or reduce services in Nigeria. These factors have also been a disincentive for new investment, as investors wait for an expected further devaluation of the Nigerian naira. While 100 percent foreign ownership of firms is generally permitted, investments in the oil and gas sector are limited to joint ventures or production-sharing agreements with domestic firms. Additionally, foreign investors must register with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission.

The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation ( including for neighboring countries ) .61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally ( especially in the central region ) , creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns .	Across survey years and labor input variables (family and hired), rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective. Cotton and cashew producers make the most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Finally, consistent with findings from other countries (for example, Damiani (2003) for Brazil), vegetable production is also highly labor intensive. Its potential has so far been largely left unexploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but much scope for improvement remains.

Delayed involvement of women led to reduced information amongst them ( as primary caregivers ) about potential approaches to tend to the sick within the household ( ACAPS , 2016 ) .	One of the lessons learnt from the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone is the missed opportunity of effective social mobilisation by women. Delayed involvement of women led to reduced information amongst them (as primary caregivers) about potential approaches to tend to the sick within the household (ACAPS, 2016). Learning from the Ebola crisis, UN Women argues that an effective approach could be to enlist women's organisations and communicate key messages through them (Devex, 2020). These messages could cover a range of gender-specific challenges that are a direct or indirect outcome of COVID-19 such as information and messaging on domestic violence, accessing healthcare services, and awareness on social protection programmes targeted toward women.

Through A4L support , the two networks have also undertaken research ( on topics such as assessment of transversal competencies , the use and impact of learning assessments and so on ) and knowledge sharing ( for example , webinars , newsletters and a knowledge portal ) .	In 2017, GPE launched the assessment for learning (A4L) initiative. A4L provides support at global and regional levels, which, in concert with the funding model requirement and its operationalization through the sector planning process, ensures that GPE's support to measuring learning is a coherent package that contributes to improved national learning assessment systems across DCPs. A4L has supported the development of a toolkit to support diagnostics of learning assessment systems to inform strategies to strengthen these systems.26 It is being piloted in three DCPs--Ethiopia, Mauritania and Vietnam--after which it will be finalized and disseminated. A4L also supports regional assessment networks in the Asia-Pacific region (NEQMAP) and in Sub-Saharan Africa (TALENT) focusing on capacity development, research and knowledge sharing among countries of these two regions. These networks have been instrumental in collecting the information for Indicator 15. To date, A4L has supported the organization of four regional capacity development workshops on technical aspects of learning assessment,27 such as contextual data and reporting and dissemination of results. Through A4L support, the two networks have also undertaken research (on topics such as assessment of transversal competencies, the use and impact of learning assessments and so on) and knowledge sharing (for example, webinars, newsletters and a knowledge portal). Finally, A4L contributes to the exploration of broader measurements of learning, through a landscape review of the measurement of 21st-century skills and the piloting of tools for assessing these skills.28 A4L will dovetail with GPE's new Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, which is being launched in 2019 with an aim of strengthening national education systems by engaging DCPs and other partners in knowledge generation, innovation and capacity strengthening on a range of technical topics, including learning assessment systems. 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Source GPE Secretariat.

Results from a program implemented in nursing homes in Massachusetts in the United States found that having opportunities for growth improved communication and teamwork, reduced turnover, and built self-respect and confidence among staff.25 Jobs can have similar effects for low-wage workers in developing countries, and these effects can have implications for social cohesion. The growth of the garment sector in Bangladesh brought more than 3 million women into the workplace. Although the factory jobs were physically demanding and poorly paid, they expanded women's autonomy and increased their opportunities to participate in public life.26 ""I am braver now,"" a 26-year-old worker explained, ""I understand more things which I did not before.""27 Observers noted that the sight of women walking back and forth to work changed popular notions about the acceptability of women in the public space and their right to access public institutions.28 Coworkers travel together, share information about work opportunities, and form savings groups.29 The effect of jobs on identity also holds for self-employed workers, including farmers (box 4.4). Jobs that provide access to voice can be empowering and give workers a stake and shared interest in their work.30 Informal workers lack access to representation on the job and are similarly excluded from local government and economic associations. Associations of self-employed workers and farmers help fill these gaps.31 A core strategy of the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India has been to empower its members and partners by increasing their say in communities (box 4.5)."

This challenge is being overcome by intensifying the publicity of the project through several channels (social media - Facebook, Instagram, website, open media - TV, supporter and partner sites - UFPE, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Hospital Clinics, etc.), and mainly based on our user's experience (word-of-mouth). The second is to incorporate these new digital practices into the routine of health professionals. Awareness and training are being used to overcome this challenge. This project is organizationally and financially sustainable, since telehealth has already proved to be viable and an important instrument to complement face-to-face healthcare. Partnerships and financial support in the public and private sectors are viable alternatives, due to the scalability of the solution, and recognition of the cost-benefit ratio of digital practices. In addition, our institution is a recognized and solid public university in Brazil, with 73 years of commitment to society, the environment and the country's economy. Our technological strategy can be easily adopted and translate to other languages. However, Internet access must be available, teleconsulting specialist team is according to availability, ethical and regulatory aspects need to be considered, and telecommunications fee can be applied.

The focus is on features of the agricultural system that are important from a jobs perspective and agricultural subsectors that are particularly promising for inclusive employment, but that have so far received less attention in national employment strategies. This is not to dismiss the important potential of export crops, but these have been discussed extensively elsewhere (WorldBank 2012; 2015). Furthermore, many of the challenges faced by these crops, are also akin to those faced in the rice chains, which are discussed in more detail.53 The chapter concludes with five policy entry points.

Rural households do not combine many agricultural activities with nonagricultural activities , although , of course , there is substantial diversification within agriculture itself , such as combination of cash and food crops , agriculture and livestock ( see discussion in Chapter3 ) .	Although many individuals cumulate several activities, there is little diversification in employment types within households. Different members of the same household tend to be engaged in similar types of activities, so that households are fairly specialized in wage employment, nonagricultural self-employment, or agricultural self-employment. For instance, 40.2 percent of households are engaged in agricultural self-employment only, 21.1 percent in nonagricultural self-employment only, and 18.2 percent in wage employment only. Only about 20 percent of households have members in different employment types. The most common diversification pattern combines wage employment and nonagricultural self-employment (9.5 percent of households nationally), followed by nonagricultural self-employment and agricultural employment (8.9 percent of households nationally). Diversification patterns differ in urban and rural areas (Figure1.11).

First it is necessary to delve into the premise of the question. This question looks at humanitarian action explicitly labeled as LHL, as this research has made the case that women and women's organizations are and have been involved in providing humanitarian support. Additionally, LHL, which prioritizes leadership by local and national actors, is argued to be a better model of humanitarian action because such actors have the contextual knowledge to respond effectively and have the trust of and proximity to the affected communities.9 This framing would align with feminist models that argue for the importance of contextual knowledge that is deeply connected to the voices and needs of the community.

Twenty-four participants (10 females and 14 males) attended the Tanzania event. Each agenda reflects the availability and needs from the host country, and therefore have slight variations in regard to time and sequence. The Tanzania event was scheduled for two days. Each event covered similar topics as described above, and all three covered a SWOT analysis exercise. Participants were asked to brainstorm ideas and compile feedback on various aspects in regard to SI. For clarification purposes, a SWOT analysis is a strategy commonly used in strategic program planning. It provides a simple framework for an entity to scan both the internal and external environment. The SWOT analysis provides information that is helpful in matching the entity's resources and capabilities to the environment in which it operates. It also acts as a filter to reduce the information generated through the exercise to a manageable number of key issues. As the name implies, a SWOT analysis consists of four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. These categories can further be defined as either internal or external factors. Strengths and weaknesses are often internal to an entity. Opportunities and threats tend to be external factors, often beyond the control of the FtF Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab (SIIL) -1 - SWOT Analysis Report - Tanzania entity/organization, but that impact and/or influence operations.

"Beyond labor policies 313 QUESTION 9 Creative destruction, the mainstay of economic growth, happens to a large extent through labor reallocation. As workers move from jobs in low-productivity farms and obsolete firms to jobs in more dynamic economic units, output increases and the economy moves closer to the efficiency frontier. Differences in productivity across economic units underlie this creative destruction process. Such differences can reflect a healthy ecosystem driven by competition which offers the basis for efficiencyenhancing job reallocation. Market imperfections and government failures may hinder labor reallocation, however, resulting in a wider dispersion of productivity and many missed opportunities for growth.120 Stringent regulations that obstruct the movement of workers from low-to high-productivity areas or that prevent their separation from obsolete firms are a case in point. These regulations may stem from good intentions, such as containing congestion in cities or providing earnings stability to workers. But their cost in productivity growth can be substantial. Regulations of this kind do not sit on the efficiency ""plateau"" where labor policies are mainly redistributive; they are rather on the cliff, and have unambiguously negative effects on economic efficiency."

Each of the five researched countries approaches the challenge of improving English skills in different ways. During the course of this research each country was assessed on nine qualitative indicators focussed on the education system to understand how the English language benefits individuals. These included: the proportion of English speakers; how adequately educated the workforce is; government expenditure on education; the usage of Internet and mobile phones. For the purposes of this study several interviews were also conducted with government bodies, universities and other educational institutions. The five researched countries all had until recently a comparatively underdeveloped educational system, and an unequal concentration of educational resources in urban areas. During the course of research it was found that children in rural areas spend an average of three hours every day travelling to their nearest school. Individuals with the desire to learn English and gain other forms of further education will need to move to major urban centres to acquire the education and the job opportunities that will allow them to achieve their personal ambitions.

Jobs connected to world markets may lead to knowledge spillovers and make other workers more productive .	What are good jobs for development? PART2 Introduction to Part 2 Earnings, benefits (if any), and overall job satisfaction are what matter to individual jobholders. Those earnings and benefits--tangible or otherwise--are the first and most direct measure of the value a job has to society. But jobs may also affect others, positively or negatively. Jobs for women may influence resource allocations at the household level and benefit their children. Jobs connected to world markets may lead to knowledge spillovers and make other workers more productive. Jobs that provide opportunities may convey a sense of fairness to others and help them remain engaged. Spillovers like these have been the focus of recent thinking on development. The analysis may be organized around concepts such as gender, urbanization, or conflict; but much of the action happens through jobs.

New technologies (increased plant density, in particular) have resulted in increased yield. The adoption of simple harvesting, shelling and drying equipment, has led to a dramatic increase in production. Increases (from 300 farmers producing 400,000 lbs in 2001 to 700 farmers producing an estimated 1,500,000 lbs in 2004) have resulted in over-production. This has largely been from increases in area planted rather than yields and is often due to more bush-clearing and environmental destruction which is not sustainable. Although the project has undoubted social and economic benefits, the environmentally impact has been somewhat negative. Production has exceeded demand and prices have declined, causing discouragement among growers. In Guyana women are generally not very involved in farming, although a few of the larger growers (who produce about 30 ha) are women. Individual farmers generally cultivate in the order of 1-3 ha.

In the coming decade, WARDA will expand the number of farmers exposed to NERICAs throughout the region through PVS. * The development of new inter-and intraspecific rice cultivars. WARDA will enlarge the gene pool for uplands using advanced and more traditional breeding tools. In addition, participatory plant breeding will provide farmer input into WARDA's breeding program and speed up the identification of favorable plant material with resistance to drought and soil acidity. * Validation and dissemination of integrated natural resource management (INRM) practices. INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and/or sustainable intensification. Building on previous achievements in the development of N-fixing fallow legumes and the introduction of a modest use of fertilizer, including rock-phosphate, emphasis will be placed on integrated biophysical and socioeconomic assessment of these technologies and the formulation of adequate baskets of technologies. * Creating an enabling environment for the scaling-up of NERICAs and INRM practices. For the varietal component, a focus will be placed on community-based seed supply systems to address weak seed multiplication systems for farmers of rainfed rice.

"Upland rice is grown in an intensively managed commercial system in the Brazilian Cerrado, where it is rotated with soybean and pasture and often receives supplemental irrigation. Rice is grown no more often than one season in three because of the yield decline associated with continuous or short-rotation upland rice production. Commercial, high-input upland rice production with supplemental irrigation is also emerging in water-short areas of northern China. These intensively managed upland crops are now usually referred to as ""aerobic rice"" to distinguish them from traditional low-input rice crops.

The development of rural areas and secondary towns in Coted'Ivoire is further called for to productively absorb labor exiting agriculture. About four in five rural workers are engaged in agriculture, which is consistent with the ratios observed in other countries at similar levels of development. Yet only a very small (and relatively smaller) share of the rural population (4 percent) holds nonagricultural wage jobs, pointing to limited employment opportunities in the rural economy, and consistent with the high degree of urbanization and urban concentration in Coted'Ivoire. Households also tend to be more specialized, either in agriculture or in nonagricultural self-employment.

The weighted average of the proportions of seats held by women in the five countries with both reserved seats and legislated candidate quotas is 29 per cent (not shown in figure 5.2). Additionally, in Georgia, the legislation on political parties sets a gender quota of 30 per cent in every 10 candidates on the list, and provides for financial incentives to those parties which comply with this requirement.

Difficulty in progressing through the primary grades ( repeating ) or leaving school before completing the last grade of primary education ( dropping out ) occur for a variety of reasons , mostly related to the educational system and social and economic factors .	Poverty and other barriers further reinforce gender disparities in learning opportunities The reasons why children do not attend school vary, but they are often associated with poverty, ethnicity, social exclusion, living in a rural area or slum, geographic remoteness, disasters, armed conflict, lack of basic facilities and poor-quality education. These barriers often interact with gender to create even greater disadvantages in learning opportunities. Countries face different challenges and need different policies depending on their circumstances. Among interventions that have successfully been used to reach the disadvantaged and the marginalized, especially girls include: the abolishment of school fees; increased education budgets; social cash transfers, especially to support poor families, making it easier for them to send their children to school; increasing attention to ethnic and linguistic minorities; overcoming conflicts that keep children out of school because of hostilities; and improving the quality of education.15 School progression at the primary level In order to achieve universal completion of primary education, it is important that all boys and girls of primary school age attend school and progress through primary education. High levels of repetition and drop out hinder a considerable number of children from transitioning to secondary education.

SAFRINET is a Southern African Development Community (SADC) project, and the southern African network of BioNET-International. Its purpose is to build capacity for the provision of taxonomic services, i.e. the identification of, and provision of information on, organisms. This capacity is inter alia essential for: * curbing the spread of IAS, including pests and disease * food security * eliminating poverty, especially among rural people * enhancing international trade in agricultural and horticultural products * conserving biological diversity and preventing the loss of natural ecosystems. For agricultural and horticultural quarantine services, a taxonomist can only be expected to identify a small proportion of the potentially harmful species that may move through any port of importation or exportation. Therefore, using current methods for organism identification, a cadre of taxonomists is needed for effective identification services, and each requires considerable training and years of experience. Building taxonomic capacity that depends on human expertise is, therefore, a long-term, costly exercise. The need, however, is vital, urgent, and massive. It is unrealistic to expect that a sufficient number of competent taxonomists will be trained within the foreseeable future, so new, cost-and time-effective mechanisms for providing identification services must be implemented.

When asked about their most preferred jobs, survey respondents from four diverse countries provide different answers from those they offer when asked about the most important jobs to society (figure 5.1). They frequently mention working in the civil service or as a shop owner as the jobs they would prefer for themselves, while identifying teachers and doctors as the most important jobs for societies. China is the only country where a job in civil service is seen as more important for society than for the individual. In the Arab Republic of Egypt, a job as a teacher is more valued individually than socially. And in Sierra Leone, being a farmer is appreciated both individually and socially, while in the other countries it is recognized as socially valuable but is not a preferred job.	H.

The country remains an essentially agricultural economy , but the government 's determination to create a knowledge-based economy from the ground up will increase the need for investment in the long term .	Government targets global relationships According to the Organisation of the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Rwanda saw substantial growth in FDI over 2005-2008, with investment increasing by 90% to reach US$930.6 million in 2008. This reflects government efforts to lower corruption and use aid in an effective and transparent way, making investment more attractive. The president's effective wooing of potential US and UK investors has also brought investment, as well as a willingness to look to non-traditional investment partners. South Africa, for example, has provided investment for luxury hotels and shopping centres. This contributed to economic performance and boosted the need for English speakers. Rwandan economy largely agricultural, limited investment opportunities The switch to English in the education system is cited as part of the government's strategy to bolster FDI. Education Minister Charles Murigande stated in 2010 that the adoption of English is a logical choice given the countries with which Rwandans do business, citing Dubai, Malaysia, China and Japan as examples. However, in terms of actual revenue, Rwandan FDI levels are low. Without the hydrocarbon reserves that saw massive FDI inflows into other regional markets - Nigeria's FDI in 2009, for example, was US$5,851 million compared with Rwanda's US$119 million - opportunities for investment are limited.

Inadequate pricing policies and regulations amplify the gap in needed infrastructure services .	Access to affordable and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite for firms to operate. Power shortages are the number-two constraint to firm growth and job creation mentioned by entrepreneurs the world over--and number one in low-income countries. Telecommunications allow for a better flow of information with suppliers and customers, and the internet and mobile technology facilitate the spread of new ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets, as do ports and airports.79 The way infrastructure is regulated is important as well. Inadequate pricing policies and regulations amplify the gap in needed infrastructure services. In many countries, monopolies based on political connections have led to reduced quantities of infrastructure services at higher prices and lower quality.80 Business regulation also affects the opportunities for businesses to grow and create jobs. Regulations can increase the cost of doing business, in money or in time needed to comply.

Mozambique was selected for review as an example of a post-conflict country faced with a major natural disaster. It also offers an example of recovery not only in an extremely poor and primarily subsistence livelihood population, but also in a country favored by donors and receiving substantial amounts of relief and recovery assistance. The review provides an overview of the recovery processes and highlights livelihoods and agriculture. The floods in 2001, following those in 2000, provided an opportunity to see whether lessons had been learned between the two disasters. The review is based on a range of interviews with key stakeholders (see annex A), as well as identification and analysis of relevant documentation. Stakeholders were selected to cover a range of government, donor, multilateral, bilateral agencies and organizations, as well as international and national NGOs. The study was supported by a Mozambican non-profit organization, Associacao de Nutricao e Seguranca Alimentar (ANSA). ANSA also carried out a complementary community survey in three locations to assess the impact of recovery on communities and the roles played by local government and agencies. This review and the community survey were designed to focus on overlapping areas and to garner responses concerning recovery from both key stakeholders in the government and agencies and the affected population. The full community survey report appears in Section II of this document. Apart from NGO evaluations of specific emergency programs, apparently no other post-emergency research has been carried out looking at recovery programs and their impacts on communities.

The EU Common Market Organization (CMO) provides a framework for market measures under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), including for measures related to the promotion of fruit and vegetables. Implementing rules, covering fresh and processed products, are designed to encourage the development of producer organizations (POs) as the main vehicle for crisis management and market promotion. The CMO makes payments to POs for dozens of products, including peaches, citrus fruits, and olives. In 2015, a new basic payment scheme and greening payments were introduced, replacing the single payment scheme. Direct payments also are paid to support certain processing sectors, including, for example, peaches for juicing in Greece. The general lack of transparency around the distribution of EU subsidies at the Member State level in the fruit and vegetable industry raises questions about whether the payments are decoupled from production, and U.S. producers remain concerned about potential hidden subsidies.

International Migration The academic literature on migration responds in part to trends in migration phenomena and policy as well as to shifts in migration-related theory and previously published literature. Normally, there is a discernible time lag between the onset of a phenomenon and the appearance of scientific literature, this owing to the time required for research and then for publishing. The literature on the Syrian refugee crisis is now beginning to appear in significant amounts, and we can expect that the literature on the United Nations' Global Compacts will start appearing in 2019.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council of Cyprus is charged with this responsibility .	NRB Mandates NRBs in Eastern Europe have varying mandates and most include public protection except for Estonia, which is charged with promotion of the profession of nursing and workforce, labor, and union issues. Promotion of the profession is mandated in 11 of the reporting jurisdictions. Workforce, labor, and unions issues were reported as NRB mandates in Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, and Serbia. Responsibilities of the NRBs vary across this region. Promotion of other health professionals and public protection under the umbrella of the Bulgarian Association of Health Professionals in Nursing is included in Bulgaria. The NRB in Lithuania is responsible for policy making in the field of nursing and legal regulation of nursing practice. Romanian NRBs are mandated with jurisdiction regulation, surveillance of continued professional development, and recognition of quality. In Russia, the Ministry determines entry requirements to nursing professions, as well as practice in nursing professions and standards and procedures of providing care. The majority of NRBs are empowered to administer nursing laws and regulations, make decisions about scope of practice, discipline nurses, and participate in the creation of legislation. The Bulgarian Association of Health Professionals in Nursing also handles economic matters related to the Association and provides financial and logistical support. Ukraine provides consultation on nursingrelated employment in Ukraine and abroad. Additionally, the Ministry of Education or a related national accrediting agency in most countries is tasked with the responsibility of approving nursing schools/programs in the majority of nations in this region. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Russia, and Turkey, however, grant such authority to their Ministry of Health organizations.

The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history .	"The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history. Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

The United States is responsible for 26 percent of global cumulative greenhouse gases, and Europe is responsible for an additional 22 percent. In contrast, the entire continent of Africa contributes just 3.8 percent. While high-income countries are responsible for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions, it is the lowincome countries that will face the repercussions. Many low-income countries are located in the tropics, which are far more vulnerable to rising temperatures than high-income temperate countries such as the United Kingdom.

However, there are signs that the country is addressing some of these drawbacks.

There has also been impressive progress with regard to safety and security (61st to 23rd) as homicide rates dropped (48th) and police reliability improved (13th). The fall in terrorist incidence should also mitigate often-held safety fears; but since this indicator still ranks 123rd, far more needs to be done to dispel concerns.

The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs .	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.

Does the Ecological Footprint ignore the role of population growth as a driver in humanity's increasing consumption? The total Ecological Footprint of a nation or of humanity as a whole is a function of the number of people consuming, the quantity of goods and services an average person consumes, and the resource intensity of these goods and services. Since Footprint accounting is historical, it does not predict how any of these factors will change in the future. However, if population grows or declines (or any of the other factors change), this will be reflected in future Footprint accounts.

Mechanized agriculture equipment , genetically engineered seeds , irrigation , fertilizers , and pesticides can increase the yield of biologically productive land .	Careful land management can ensure that bioproductive areas do not decrease due to anthropogenic influence on factors including urbanization, deforestation, erosion, pollution, and desertification. Yields can often be increased through technology, but innovation needs to be managed cautiously to avoid harming human or ecological health. Mechanized agriculture equipment, genetically engineered seeds, irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides can increase the yield of biologically productive land. However, many of these technological inputs come at the expense of a larger Ecological Footprint due to additional energy and resource inputs. These technologies may also decrease biocapacity in future years by increasing topsoil runoff, reducing water availability, decreasing biological diversity, or increasing the degradation of surrounding areas.

The dataset covers the universe of registered firms in all sectors - - agriculture , mining , manufacturing , construction , and services .	The main analysis in this chapter is based on anonymized firm-level data from the Registrar of Companies for the modern enterprise sectors, collected by the National Statistics Institute (INS). The Registrar of Companies collects information upon incorporation including physical location, sector classification and shareholdings for all shareholders. All registered operating firms are then legally required to submit annual filings to the INS, the tax administration (Direction Generale des Impots, DGI), the court of justice, and the Central Bank (Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, BCEAO) with detailed financial and employment information, which are reported under the West Africa accounting system standards, Systeme Comptable Ouest Africain (SYSCOA).90 Firms hand in hard copies of their forms between March and June following the closing of the fiscal year in December, after which the data are processed by INS.91 The resulting panel dataset, Centrale des Bilans (CdB), covers the years 2003-2012. It spans part of the conflict episodes in 2003-2006, recovery after the Ouagadougou peace accord of 2007, the post-electoral crisis in 2010/2011 and establishment of a new government in 2011. It includes unique firm identification which allows us to track firms over time. The dataset covers the universe of registered firms in all sectors --agriculture, mining, manufacturing, construction, and services. A major advantage of this dataset is that it does not have a cut-off point in terms of size either by revenue or employment, including one-person firms (firms without employees). While smaller firms --those below certain revenue thresholds --are subject to different tax regimes, they are required to submit financial and employment information in a simplified format. As a result, the data allow us to have a full picture of the formal economy.

Through INVIMA (Colombia's sanitary authority, analogous to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Resolution 719 of 2015, Colombia has assigned risk categories to foods with a view to imposing new requirements on foods depending on the category of risk. While Colombia has indicated it intends to apply the envisioned categories to both imported and domestic products, the United States is concerned about the criteria that Colombia uses to assign risk. The United States continues to engage with Colombia and affected stakeholders regarding the impact of these requirements. Ministry of Health Decree 539 of 2014 included numerous new requirements for high-risk foods, including plant registration with INVIMA and the inspection of facilities intending to export to Colombia. In January 2017, Colombia notified a draft regulation to the WTO that would amend Decree 539 by introducing a provision that allows for the recognition of the food safety systems of trading partners with which Colombia has free trade agreements, thereby exempting U.S. federally regulated establishments from individual inspection and approval requirements. The United States welcomed the prospective addition of this provision to Decree 539, but Colombia has yet to issue the final amended measure.

In the export case study, as noted, Doing Business does not assume a containerized shipment, and time and cost estimates may be based on the transport of 15 tons of noncontainerized products. In the import case study auto parts are assumed to be containerized. In the cases where cargo is containerized, the time and cost for transport and other procedures are based on a shipment consisting of homogeneous cargo belonging to a single Harmonized System (HS) classification code. This assumption is particularly important for inspections, because shipments of homogeneous products are often subject to fewer and shorter inspections than shipments of products belonging to various HS codes.

GETTING CREDIT Doing Business measures the legal rights of borrowers and lenders with respect to secured transactions through one set of indicators and the reporting of credit information through another. The first measures whether certain features that facilitate lending exist within the applicable collateral and bankruptcy laws. The second measures the coverage, scope and accessibility of credit information available through credit reporting service providers such as credit bureaus or credit registries (figure 8.9). The ranking of economies on the ease of getting credit is determined by sorting their scores for getting credit. These scores are the sum of the scores for the strength of legal rights index and the depth of credit information index (figure 8.10). 95DATA NOTES LEGAL RIGHTS OF BORROWERS AND LENDERS The data on the legal rights of borrowers and lenders are gathered through a questionnaire administered to financial lawyers and verified through analysis of laws and regulations as well as public sources of information on collateral and bankruptcy laws. Questionnaire responses are verified through several rounds of follow-up communication with respondents as well as by contacting third parties and consulting public sources.

"WHO guideline on health policy and system support to optimize community health worker programmes36 versus longer?"" (57) - identified eight eligible studies (six quantitative, two qualitative). Four of the included studies were conducted in three countries in Africa (Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia), two in the United States, and one each in Haiti and Lao People's Democratic Republic. All the studies comparing different training durations referred to intervention and control groups of very short duration (days or hours of training). Two trials comparing training duration suggested that training of greater duration or frequency (for example, half a day versus half an hour, or three hours versus no training) may be positively correlated with improved measures of CHW competency in screening and diagnostic test performance (58, 59). Findings from three cross-sectional studies regarding associations between measures of CHW competency and pre-service training duration were however equivocal, with one study showing an association of greater competency with longer initial training duration (60), one study showing mixed effects for extended training (61), and another showing an inverse relationship between training duration and competency (62). One cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) did not find a difference in CHW skill advancement with regard to the number of attempts required to pass the course examination between groups of CHWs undergoing pre-service education of different duration (63). Two qualitative studies reported a preference by CHWs for longer training (64, 65). The systematic review team rated the overall certainty of the evidence as low."

In this context , the concept of resilience has been adapted to be cognizant of issues such as marginality , power , and agency and associated social and institutional structures that the vulnerability literature has flagged as being important to explain differential susceptibility to harm ( Bene et al. 2012 , 2014 , Tanner et al. 2015 ) .	Central to the notion of resilience is the ability of a system to absorb shocks or stresses while maintaining existing structure and function (Folke 2006). In ecology, resilience is the degree to which a system can adapt, learn, and self-organize (Walker et al. 2004). Resilience to disasters is the ability to manage change, by maintaining or transforming living standards in the face of shocks without compromising long-term prospects (DFID 2011). Recognizing the strength of resilience as a concept to guide understanding of system response to change and exogenous shocks, researchers and policy makers are utilizing the concept to address development challenges (Barrett and Constas 2014, Bene et al. 2016b). In this context, the concept of resilience has been adapted to be cognizant of issues such as marginality, power, and agency and associated social and institutional structures that the vulnerability literature has flagged as being important to explain differential susceptibility to harm (Bene et al. 2012, 2014, Tanner et al. 2015). Recent definitions of resilience, adopted herein, describe it as a capacity, possessed by a unit, e.g. household, community, or country, to maintain or improve standards of living while facing an uncertain risk landscape (Barrett and Constas 2014).	In this context, the concept of resilience has been adapted to be cognizant of issues such as marginality, power, and agency and associated social and institutional structures that the vulnerability literature has flagged as being important to explain differential susceptibility to harm (Bene et al. 2012, 2014, Tanner et al. 2015).

"Part 2 Ecological accounting What can the Footprint tell us about the condition of Earth as a whole? Does it take a position on global questions of justice? Does the indicator convey underlying messages for highincome and low-income countries? As mentioned, humanity probably first went into overshoot in the 1980s. Before that time, the global community consumed resources and produced carbon dioxide at a rate consistent with what the planet could produce and reabsorb. By the mid 1990's humanity was already using approximately 15 percent more resources in a year than the planet could supply. The following tables and country comparisons reference the timeframe 1961-2005. Since the year 1961, the United Nations has published complete data records for more than 170 countries, which document not only harvest yields but also import and export data. Footprint data in this brochure referes to the ""2008 edition"" which uses data from 2005. Every two years footprint data is updated by means of improved methodology.

"Croatia continued to return to Serbia refugees and migrants who entered the country irregularly, without granting them access to an effective asylum process. These pushbacks by police, sometimes from deep inside Croatian territory, routinely involved coercion, intimidation, confiscation or destruction of private valuables and the disproportionate use of force by the police. In July, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Croatia had acted against the rules of the Dublin Regulation (which defines which EU member state has the obligation to evaluate the asylum claims) by allowing transit for refugees and migrants through the country in 2015 without examining applications for international protection. The NGO Centre for Peace Studies documented that between January and April, at least 30 asylum applications - including those from families with children - had been dismissed on the grounds of ""security concerns"" during a routine security check carried out by the Security and Intelligence Agency as part of the asylum process. The notes of these applications were marked as ""classified"" and could not be seen and thus could not be rebutted or challenged on appeal by those seeking asylum or their legal representatives. Cases with classified notes led to an automatic rejection by the Ministry of Interior. Subsequently, the failed asylumseekers were at risk of expulsion from the country and at heightened risk of refoulement - a measure forcing an individual to return to a country where they would risk serious human rights violations."

Country Notes The common education structure at the school level follows the pattern of '10 + 2'; ten years of basic education, followed by two years of upper secondary school. Classes and grade levels have different names depending on the state in which instruction takes place. Terminology for school leaving examinations can be confusing as it also varies. The basic structure for schooling is comprised of eight years of elementary education; five years of lower elementary (Standards I to V), three years of higher elementary (Standards VI to VIII). This is followed by two years of secondary education (Standards IX and X). At the end of ten years of schooling a Secondary School Certificate is awarded upon passing the examinations set by the relevant State or Central Board of Secondary Education. Students who wish to continue for higher studies must complete a two-year higher secondary program (Standards XI and XII), choosing science, humanities or vocational streams, which culminates in the Higher Secondary Certificate or Standard XII examination certificate.

The stakeholder perception survey found various strategies for strengthening the supply chain for CHWs to be both acceptable and feasible, with the exception of the use of social media distribution aid, for which the acceptability and feasibility were rated as more uncertain. 7.15.4 Interpretation of the evidence and other considerations by the GDG The GDG recognized that an effective supply chain for CHWs is one of the critical factors that represent a precondition for effective service delivery. It also noted the absence of waste management from the literature identified. The GDG was of the view that extending to CHW programmes the national supply chain (as opposed to setting up a separate independent one) represents a key element of health system integration and sustainability. 7.15.5 Implementation considerations To ensure appropriate implementation of the identified strategies, and to avoid fragmentation into parallel competing supply chains, relevant CHW commodities should be included in the national pharmaceutical supply plan or equivalent national supply chain plan.

Transition rates were above 95 per cent also in Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Caucasus and Central Asia, and between 85 and 95 per cent in Northern Africa, South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Western Asia. Some of the lowest transition rates were found in sub-Saharan Africa, where only 77 per cent of girls and 79 per cent of boys moved on to secondary education. Slightly over a third of the countries in the region recorded rates over 90 per cent, while about another third of countries registered rates below 75 per cent.

Interactions between company founders or company officers and employees are not counted as procedures. Procedures that must be completed in the same building but in different offices or at different counters are counted as separate procedures. If founders have to visit the same office several times for different sequential procedures, each is counted separately.

If the services of professionals are required, procedures conducted by such professionals on behalf of the company are counted as separate procedures. Each electronic procedure is counted as a separate procedure. Approvals from spouses to own a business or leave the home are considered procedures if required by law or if by failing to obtain such approval the spouse will suffer consequences under the law, such as the loss of right to financial maintenance. Obtaining permissions only required by one gender for company registration and operation, or getting additional documents only required by one gender for a national identification card are considered additional procedures. In that case, only procedures required for one spouse but not the other are counted.

CHWs providing community-based care for infants and children in resource-limited settings can reduce neonatal, infant and child mortality and morbidity (for example, from malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea) (17-27). While there is high-quality evidence that homebased neonatal care reduces neonatal and perinatal mortality in South Asian settings with high neonatal mortality rates and poor access to health facility-based care (22, 23), other reviews reported mixed results, with some individual empirical studies included in reviews not showing improvements in CHW intervention areas (18). Evidence of the impact of CHW interventions on neonatal outcomes is promising but of moderate quality (21) and on CHW capacity to provide skilled birth care is of low quality (21). Antenatal and neonatal practice indicators also significantly improved (23). Compared to physicians, trained CHWs may screen for possible bacterial infection in young infants with relatively high sensitivity but somewhat lower specificity (28). There is some evidence of moderate quality that CHWs are effective in the promotion of essential newborn care (15), including skin-to-skin care for newborns (15). CHWs can perform effective case management of child pneumonia (29), although pneumonia management performance is mixed when pneumonia management is integrated with malaria diagnosis and treatment (30).

Labor productivity increases across the agricultural subsectors will thus be equally necessary to keep agriculture competitive with other nonagricultural sectors , so as to retain youth , reap the job opportunities that growth in domestic and external demand for agricultural products presents , and also to pace the transition of labor out of agriculture and foster demand for nonagricultural products and nonfarm employment generation .	Despite good prospects for new jobs and better earnings within agriculture, over time, most jobs will be generated outside agriculture. It is often youth that is inclined to leave agriculture first and in greater numbers. So far, the pace of youth's exit out of agriculture has been in line with Coted'Ivoire's level of development. An important share of the demand for nonagricultural products and services and thus nonagricultural employment, especially for the poorer segments of society, will come from broad-based agricultural growth in the rural hinterlands (and less so from formal wage employment in modern manufacturing). In fact, even during the fast-growth period in the years after the post-electoral crisis, the majority of new 'jobs' generated were in self-employment (most of which were in agriculture on family farms). Only a minority of new jobs were wage jobs (mostly still informal). In this sense, many of the new jobs for youths will also be indirectly linked to agriculture and agribusiness. Labor productivity increases across the agricultural subsectors will thus be equally necessary to keep agriculture competitive with other nonagricultural sectors, so as to retain youth, reap the job opportunities that growth in domestic and external demand for agricultural products presents, and also to pace the transition of labor out of agriculture and foster demand for nonagricultural products and nonfarm employment generation.

ANDACCELERATINGPOVERTYREDUCTION With two-thirds of Coted'Ivoire's poor living in rural areas according to recent (2011) estimates and almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, raising labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and more inclusive employment generation in Coted'Ivoire. This also plays to its potential comparative advantage in cash crop production and takes advantage of the rising demand for high-value and processed agricultural produce following rising incomes and dietary diversification, especially among its large urban population. For the country to grasp these opportunities, agricultural labor productivity will need to be made competitive with off-farm opportunities in the cities. Otherwise the exit of youth out of agriculture, some degree of which is normal, will only accelerate. Modernizing agriculture is therefore thefirst prong to more, better, and more inclusive employment. It will be the topic of Chapter3.

This chapter discusses UHC and a range of health, social and economic factors that influence the TB epidemic and the consequences of developing TB disease. Section 7.1 describes and explains a TB-SDG monitoring framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help focus attention on SDG-related indicators that are associated with trends in TB incidence. Analysis of these indicators can inform action in the health sector and beyond. Section 7.2 provides an overview of the status of progress towards UHC at global, regional and country levels, and a summary of WHO estimates of the resources required for progress towards UHC and other SDG health targets during the period 2016-2030. This includes presentation and discussion of the two SDG indicators for UHC as well as a third indicator of health expenditure per capita. Section 7.3 synthesizes results from national facility-based surveys of costs faced by TB patients and their households completed in 2016-2019 and highlights the implications of these results for approaches to TB service delivery, financing and social protection. Section 7.4 describes the status of four health-related risk factors for TB (diabetes, HIV infection, smoking and alcohol use) and seven other indicators (related to poverty, social protection, undernutrition, income growth, income inequality, housing quality and indoor air pollution) that are part of the TB-SDG monitoring framework.

Collaboration with the Ugandan Bureau of Statistics resulted on the preparation of baseline database on aflatoxin exposure levels in Ugandan population. This linkage should be strengthened to ensure maintenance of the data sets and make it accessible to local and regional researchers and policy makers. In 2002, potential partnerships with an NGO (Tostan) and the Association pour la Promotion de la Femme Senegalese (APRPFES) were negotiated. APROPFES has 200 collaborating villages in the Peanut Basin region. Since these two NGOs did not continue their participation, as was also the case for an NGO Tostan, that also initially indicated willingness to participate in the project, the project was transferred from Senegal to Uganda. In Uganda, Peanut CRSP has linked with the National Association of Women in Uganda (NAWOU) and their sub-organizations. This provided access to local women's organizations to ensure their participation in the project. Women make up majority of peanut farmers and do most of the post-harvest and processing activities. Such linkages should be maintained and strengthened.

To understand how much jobs contribute to development , it is necessary to assess these effects - - the spillovers from jobs .	As jobs provide earnings, generate output, and influence identity, they shape the wellbeing of those who hold them--and they also affect the well-being of others. To understand how much jobs contribute to development, it is necessary to assess these effects--the spillovers from jobs. Jobs that generate positive spillovers have a greater value to society than they have to the individual who holds the job, while the opposite is true when spillovers are negative. Intuitively, many people have notions about such broader payoffs. When asked about their most preferred jobs, respondents in China, Colombia, Egypt, and Sierra Leone give different answers from those they offer when asked to identify the most important jobs to society (figure 11). Working as a civil servant or as a shop owner is generally preferred by individuals, while teachers and doctors are quite often mentioned as the most important jobs for society.

Developments were especially remarkable in breeding for cold tolerance and yield ; in controlling diseases , pests , and weeds by means of chemicals ; and in mechanization of such arduous tasks as tilling , transplanting , applying fertilizers and other chemicals , harvesting , and threshing / drying .	The progress made in various sectors during the 50 years following World War II was so rapid and revolutionary that Japan attained selfsufficiency in rice in the 1970s. Developments were especially remarkable in breeding for cold tolerance and yield; in controlling diseases, pests, and weeds by means of chemicals; and in mechanization of such arduous tasks as tilling, transplanting, applying fertilizers and other chemicals, harvesting, and threshing/drying. During this period, rice yields increased from about 3.3 to 5.0 t/ha and labor required decreased from 2,200 to 500 hours per hectare. This labor efficiency allowed farmers to leave villages to work in urban industries, causing the average age in rural areas to increase rapidly. Mechanization was required not only in farming but also in various urban industries, and its success resulted in the emigration of workers in their prime of life to urban areas, leaving villages to their wives and to the elderly. However, this tendency is not particular to Japan; it is becoming common also in other rice-growing countries.

And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture , the demand for schooling and more technical skills will rise .	While most new jobs in the near future are expected to be generated outside agriculture, it currently occupies four out of five rural workers and close to half of the total labor force. Raising productivity in agriculture requires developing a rural workforce of better-educated farmers. Better-educated farmers are more likely to adopt modern farm inputs and technologies, make better use of purchased inputs and labor, choose technologies more effectively, and respond rapidly to changes in markets (Schultz 1988; Filmer et al. 2014). Improving the levels of basic educational attainment, through the development of reading, writing, and numeracy skills among the rural workforce, the efficacy of agricultural training can be significantly improved. And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture, the demand for schooling and more technical skills will rise. This will include the ability to use digital technology to access and interpret information as it may be transformative in how farmers learn to interact optimally with markets and receive information, such as weather predictions, that impact their farming decisions (Box 6.1).	And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture, the demand for schooling and more technical skills will rise.

Corruption affects the funding of school programmes , investments in schools and access to education .	Tackling corruption in the primary education sector S20 The evaluation looked at experience with primary education as an example of a sector programme not specifically directed towards AC. Corruption affects the funding of school programmes, investments in schools and access to education. Overall, there is good evidence of progress being made. Donors have exhibited persistence, solidarity and coordinated, resolute action. Change has come about through a combination of factors: * comprehensive analysis that enabled a well-informed dialogue * decentralisation of decision-making to lower levels of government, the involvement of parents in school management and transparency of decision-making * strong arrangements for independent audit and a united response by donors to early problems * donor supervision of the project being organised through a joint annual review mechanism (JARM) in a single forum.

As such , they are well equipped to design and produce an educational platform that can begin to solve these problems for the students .	Content production is an expensive activity in terms of time and money. To date, we have produced 480 videos but to keep up pace with the rate at which tv channels are burning through content (4 hours per day, for 5 days a week) we need to keep churning out more videos. We are looking for funders to help us complete our goal of creating content for the entire K-12 spectrum. We also need partners for evaluation of our content and to conduct impact assessments to make us more cognizant of our shortcomings and help us pivot to provide an even better learning solution. In the past 5 years, we have gathered a team of experienced curriculum developers, assessment specialists, data analysts, designers, developers, and animators. These team members have also often travelled to rural Pakistan together, engaging with students and understanding their pain points. As such, they are well equipped to design and produce an educational platform that can begin to solve these problems for the students. The content creating process has become linear and can be replicated anywhere in the world.

In addition to the academic literature, a number of consulting firms provide analysis and rankings of the attractiveness of countries based on the views of top executives of multinationals. A.T. Kearney has published a Foreign Direct Investment Index since 1998. Three dimensions emerge as critical in its analysis: wellfunctioning financial markets, a strong business environment, and strong labor skills. A separate index for the location of services also emphasizes skills, particularly language skills, and the degree of global integration. Labor typically accounts for a larger share of overall costs in services than in manufacturing.

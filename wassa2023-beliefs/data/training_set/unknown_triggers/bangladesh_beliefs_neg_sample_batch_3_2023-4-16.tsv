Joint evaluation of support to Anti-Corruption efforts - Bangladesh 5 1.7. Limitations This visit was the first of the five countries and as such was subject to some testing of data collection approaches, described in Chapter 2. Few preparations at country level were completed before the consultant's team arrived which resulted in some delays while documents were assembled and appointments organised with senior officials, though the team did manage to meet most of the stakeholders they wished to. A visit was made to government and NGO programmes in one district outside Dhaka and the findings have been used to inform the evaluation but are not reported separately. 1.8. Report Structure The report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 describes the methodology used. Chapter 3 then looks at the country context for Bangladesh over the period. This leads to a review of the relevance of donor AC programmes in Chapter 4, where the programmes are examined against the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), together with national needs and donor policies. In so far as documented evidence is available or the views of informants can be triangulated, the contribution of these different interventions to broader strategy objectives and key policy themes are also addressed. Chapter 5 looks at how donors have managed their programmes with specific reference to M&E, coordination and alignment with national strategies. In Chapter 6, evidence about the results of the programmes is reviewed with more detailed attention to a number of specific themes. Chapter 7 examines ways in which donors have tackled problems of corruption in the primary education sector and lessons are drawn from that experience. That leads into Chapter 8 where conclusions are identified, followed by broader lessons in Chapter 9 and some recommendations to the commissioning donors in Chapter 10.

Instead , this chapter highlights examples of key contributions made during this period , published in English by a selection of academic journals and intergovernmental organizations .	"It is important to highlight at the outset that there are fundamental differences in the publishing processes for academic and non-academic material, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The academic publishing system is largely focused on producing journal articles and books. This process typically involves multi-stage reviews and editorial comments involving authors, editors and reviewers. Most published academic research (""white"" literature) is behind paywalls (that is, not freely accessible), and often managed by commercial publishers. In contrast, the production of research and analysis publications outside of academic publishing (""grey"" literature) generally involves faster and simpler processes that are typically, although not always, characterized by more limited peer review. Contributions from grey literature (such as research reports, working papers and government/official documents) are usually freely available. A report such as this, designed to contribute to our collective understanding of migration and mobility in an increasingly interconnected world, would clearly be incomplete without describing the role of grey literature, which has been ""recognized as a key source of evidence, argument, innovation, and understanding"".6 The volume, diversity and growth of both white and grey literature preclude a systematic review of all the material produced and published on migration in 2017 and 2018. Instead, this chapter highlights examples of key contributions made during this period, published in English by a selection of academic journals and intergovernmental organizations. It provides an update to the chapter in World Migration Report 2018, including by focusing on different academic journals and intergovernmental organizations, and their key output in 2017 and 2018.7 The next section provides an overview of the different actors involved in migration research and analysis.

These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs ( seeds , fertilizer , machinery ) , storage , marketing and transport of produce , generating off-farm employment opportunities .	Nearby access to off-farm self-and wage employment in the rural economy and secondary towns is especially important for better and inclusive employment. Cross-country evidence from across the world shows convincingly that movements out of agriculture to the rural economy, secondary towns, and secondary cities (defined as less than 1 million inhabitants) are more poverty reducing than exits out of agriculture into the metropoles.48 While those who make it to the city, tend to gain much more on average than those who move nearby, only few of the poor manage to do so, and many more find their way into off-farm activities when they are nearby. The end outcome is one of an accelerated poverty reduction when people can find off-farm employment opportunities nearby. Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas. These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery), storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities. Even before accounting for related services agribusiness activities, including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing (ISIC 15) alone accounted for more than 30 percent of total formal employment and more than 20 percent of value added in formal firms (Figure5.5). Agribusiness also forms the only source of formal manufacturing jobs outside Abidjan. The past couple of years have witnessed a small increase in formal enterprise establishments outside Abidjan (Chapter5), though much room for expansion remains.

"These norms feed into an idea that "" women are not capable to be leaders "" ( Lindley-Jones 2018 , 6 ) ."	"Some of the challenges facing women and women's organizations seeking to be part of humanitarian action at the local and national levels result from constraining sociocultural norms. These norms feed into an idea that ""women are not capable to be leaders"" (Lindley-Jones 2018, 6). In addition, right-wing movements around the world are strongly pushing back against women's rights and gender justice, impeding women and women's organizations from engaging in decision-making spaces. According to a report from CIVICUS, women's rights groups were the most commonly threatened group in the civil rights sphere (2018, 9). The dangers of a backlash are real. Women's organizations that seek to advance gender equality and challenge gender norms will, by the nature of their mission, come into conflict with powerholders who do not want to share or lose the influence they have (Esplen 2013). In a survey on community decision-making on preparedness in Pakistan, several study participants expressed concern about a backlash from men if women were to engage more in public spaces, suggesting instead ""that women in conservative communities might need to request permission from their male counterparts in order to participate in public decision-making spaces"" (Van Brabant and Patel 2018, 26). These barriers to participation grow from a patriarchal terrain that has consistently devalued and discouraged women's voice and agency, particularly in public spaces."

"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month?

Despite good prospects for new jobs and better earnings within agriculture, over time, most jobs will be generated outside agriculture. It is often youth that is inclined to leave agriculture first and in greater numbers. So far, the pace of youth's exit out of agriculture has been in line with Coted'Ivoire's level of development. An important share of the demand for nonagricultural products and services and thus nonagricultural employment, especially for the poorer segments of society, will come from broad-based agricultural growth in the rural hinterlands (and less so from formal wage employment in modern manufacturing). In fact, even during the fast-growth period in the years after the post-electoral crisis, the majority of new 'jobs' generated were in self-employment (most of which were in agriculture on family farms). Only a minority of new jobs were wage jobs (mostly still informal). In this sense, many of the new jobs for youths will also be indirectly linked to agriculture and agribusiness. Labor productivity increases across the agricultural subsectors will thus be equally necessary to keep agriculture competitive with other nonagricultural sectors, so as to retain youth, reap the job opportunities that growth in domestic and external demand for agricultural products presents, and also to pace the transition of labor out of agriculture and foster demand for nonagricultural products and nonfarm employment generation.

Justice systems should act as facilitators of investment and economic growth, not obstacles. Doing Business data suggest that specialized training of lawyers and judges is an area that could benefit from more attention and resources worldwide. Even where continuing training and education are offered, they are seldom mandatory or practical to the cases assigned and often exacerbate judges' lack of expertise. However, imposing standardized mandatory training is not an adequate solution. Setting minimum standards should not come at the cost of motivation. Instead, integrating training plans into annual judicial performance evaluations (or otherwise creating incentives to continue learning) are opportunities to enhance judicial systems' indirect but significant role in investment. a.

Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted .	"A systematic literature review of reported challenges in health-care delivery to migrants and refugees in highincome countries identified three main topics of challenges in health-care delivery: communication, continuity of care and confidence.23 Communication is critical for obvious diagnostic and treatment trajectories. The availability of trained interpreters from migrant communities was described as a key aspect in providing migrant-sensitive care. Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted. Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of the health-care system, integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system. Confidence was the third most common topic mentioned and related to trust in the health-care provider, ensuring cultural sensitivity in care provision and the ability to have agency. Studies indicated that, in cases where no trustful relationship was established, patients resorted to using traditional medicine and trusted ""their own resources"" from their community for treatment. Conversely, a systematic review that investigated the perceptions, attitudes and practices of health providers in the provision of health-care services for migrants found they were challenged not only by language and cultural barriers, but also by resource constraints within their workplaces, and incoherence between professional ethics and domestic laws that limited migrants' right to health care.24 Health-care providers used innovative means to ensure care provision in managing such clinical cases with civil society groups."

This is explicit in the Ecosystem Approach and is fundamental at a time when many ecosystems face the impacts of climate change .	Geodiversity provides the foundations for life on Earth and for the diversity of natural habitats and landscapes. Many individual geological features and landforms have cultural or iconic values for humans, which influence the way that we view surrounding natural or semi-natural habitats. Geodiversity has also had a profound influence on many aspects of cultural landscapes, built environments and economic activities. Protection of geodiversity can be in response to a range of interests, including those associated with important fossil sites; reference sites for geoscience; spectacular features linked with tourism; and landforms that have particular cultural or spiritual values. Geodiversity can contribute to sustainable economic development through tourism associated with geological features. Understanding the functional links between geodiversity and biodiversity is particularly important for conservation management in dynamic environments, where natural processes (e.g., floods, erosion and deposition) maintain habitat diversity and ecological functions.

Migrants often choose destinations where they have connections. But if they do not, they can be uprooted from family and community ties that provide economic and social support, including access to jobs. They may also lack the information needed to integrate into their new destinations. Migrants moving across borders or regions, internally displaced persons or refugees fleeing from conflict or returning after a peace agreement, and soldiers demobilized after conflict may be particularly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportunities.

Land-use and climate change can also facilitate invasion by making habitats more challenging for native species and more hospitable to IAS (Mooney & Hobbs, 2001).

The World's Women 201558 such as shopping and paperwork. About two thirds of them are women, but the sex distribution changes with age. Among caregivers aged 75 and over, men have similar or higher rates of caregiving than women in two thirds of countries. The study also showed that providing personal care can be demanding and may be incompatible with a full-time job when the time spent on care is more than just a few hours. Caregivers, particularly those providing longer hours of care activities, are less likely to be employed than non-caregivers. When they are employed, they tend to work shorter hours or have a temporary work contract. Furthermore, intensive caregiving can have a negative impact on mental health. In some countries, the detrimental effect is stronger for women than for men.163 163 Ibid.	The World's Women 201558 such as shopping and paperwork.

In many situations , weed growth is prolific and weeds are a major constraint to crop yield .	Weeds are an almost universal companion of rice in the tropics. In many situations, weed growth is prolific and weeds are a major constraint to crop yield. Weeding is a major production cost, with estimates of 50-150 person-days per hectare required for manual weeding, depending on the number of weedings and type of rice culture. For many farmers, weeding requires the greatest labor input during the agricultural cycle, and labor is often not available when weeds are most damaging to the crop. Upland rice more than any other crop shows the ravages of a lack of proper weeding. Sometimes, when the land is too weedy, the crop is abandoned.

Cultural pest management methods include crop rotation , using clean seed , variable planting times , good water management , and use of manure .	As discussed above, given the number of countries where F2F volunteers will work, and the variety of ecosystems within each country, it is impossible at this stage to identify the flora and fauna at F2F sites. However, safeguards are available to protect non-target flora and fauna. Attachment C includes measures to protect national parks, forests, and other protected areas. Recommended in conjunction with F2F assistance for the use or procurement of pesticides, these measures will help ensure that the F2F program will have minimal or no significant irreversible effects on a host country's protected areas, flora, and fauna. 3.8 Factor i. Availability of other pesticides or non-chemical control methods As stated in the 2009 PERSUAP, non-chemical methods used by farmers in F2F countries are predominantly cultural and mechanical practices. This is currently the case, as well. For example, weed control by hand may be used instead of or before the application of herbicides. Cultural pest management methods include crop rotation, using clean seed, variable planting times, good water management, and use of manure. In many F2F countries non-chemical methods are the most common pest control methods used because they are the least expensive. The high price of pesticides is a deterrent to their use in many F2F countries, as mentioned in questionnaires. 12 PAN Pesticide Database can be found here: http://www.pesticideinfo.org/ Farmer-to-Farmer Programmatic Pesticide Evaluation Report and Safer Use Action Plan (PERSUAP) 40 Also, notably, IPM is not well known, especially at the smallholder level, in many F2F countries, and this has remained unchanged since the last PERSUAP. Almost all F2F countries mentioned the need for training in non-chemical methods of control. In addition, less toxic pesticides are not widely known, and often are more expensive in F2F countries than the more highly toxic pesticides. The newer, less toxic pesticides are still not registered in many countries (as was the case in 2009).

In sum, to address the employment challenge of promoting productive inclusion in Coted'Ivoire, a three-pronged approach is needed. First, with approximately two-thirds of Coted'Ivoire's poor living in rural areas and almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, modernizing and raising labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and inclusive employment generation in Coted'Ivoire. Second, expanding productive employment opportunities offthe farm will be equally important. Off-farm employment generation will be more inclusive and poverty reducing when it happens nearby. The poor are concentrated in the rural economies and secondary towns, drawing attention to the challenge of Coted'Ivoire's high rate of urban concentration and its corresponding low rate of rural off-farm wage employment. Expanding productive employment opportunities offthe farm will require not only accelerating jobs creation in formal firms, but also putting in place policies to raise productivity in nonagricultural self-employment in the informal sector, while expansion of the formal sector continues. Finally, the occupational transformation typically lags the economic transformation, and social protection will be needed for those unable to seize opportunities and access more productive employment opportunities. An in-depth discussion of social protection policies falls beyond the scope of the report, though it remains a key part of a comprehensive approach to the jobs issue.

Part 2 Ecological accounting unprecedented global material growth. Someone born in 1950 witnessed an almost unbelievable growth in world population: from 2.5 to 6.8 billion people in 2009. Between 1950 and 2000 this person also experienced a sevenfold growth in the global economy. Global water consumption rose threefold, carbon dioxide emissions fourfold, and the amount of fish caught fivefold. After the Second World War, broad population segments of the industrialized nations in Europe, North America and Japan experienced prosperity which in their grandparents' time was reserved for millionaires - telephones, refrigerators, permanently heated (or cooled) living spaces, their own washing machines and cars. Many of these trends have resulted in improved living standards and quality of life for millions of people. But they also have their costs. Ecological overshoot is the defining challenge of the 21st Century. It is unknown how far into overshoot we can get without causing critical consequences. But one thing is certain: overshoot will increasingly become a determining force.	Suggestions for further work: How has your consumption changed?

The remaining years , to present , of the project have been focused on basic and applied research studies in the laboratories at KNUST , OSU , TAMU and Texas Technical University .	During the initial phase of the research program, the Ghana Principal Investigator conducted market screening and discussions with consumers that resulted in the selection of five peanut products for the studies. The basis for the studies and their potential value resulted in interest from the consumers to present their preferences and popularity. This effort attracted the interest in and support for the research by the Cocoa Processing Company, Tema, Ghana. Formulations and processing protocols for large-scale production of the peanut products was a major development of these efforts in Ghana.

Indeed, development happens through jobs. People work their way out of poverty and hardship through better livelihoods. Economies grow as people get better at what they do, as they move from farms to firms, and as more productive jobs are created and less productive ones disappear. Societies flourish as jobs bring together people from different ethnic and social backgrounds and nurture a sense of opportunity. Jobs are thus transformational--they can transform what we earn, what we do, and even who we are.	Indeed, development happens through jobs.	World Development Report 2013: Jobs	World Bank	2012

Executive Decree No. 4522 of 2013 of the Ministry of Public Health's (MSP) National Agency for Regulation, 144 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Control, and Sanitary Surveillance, requires that all processed and packaged food products include a label with a set of colored bars indicating low, medium, or high content of salt, sugar, and fat. Although the government of Ecuador revoked in November 2018 a resolution, COMEX 116, that would require a certificate demonstrating compliance with the labeling provisions, it remains unclear what a transition phase will look like for labeling and conformity assessment of imported food and agricultural products. Implementation of this requirement reduced the imports of dozens of high value added food products from the United States, including preserved meat and vegetable products, jams, sauces, and other food products, because certification is more onerous for imports than for domestic products. In addition, processed food products of animal origin require prior authorization from three government agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, including the animal and plant health authority AGROCALIDAD, the Undersecretary of Commercialization, and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development. For processed meat products, an assessment is conducted by both the Undersecretary of Commercialization and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development, resulting in unnecessary redundancy and delay. The United States will continue to work with Ecuadorian authorities to explore alternatives, including the use of state or federal Certificates of Free Sale, a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity, or a determination of equivalence with the Ecuadorian Service for Standardization's (INEN) requirements.

Categories of informal employment are defined jointly by the type of production unit , status in employment , and access to social protection ( Hussmanns , 2004 ) .	"Contrary to predictions in the 1950s and 1960s that informal employment, including petty traders, small producers and a range of casual jobs, would be absorbed into the more formal ""modern"" economy, informal employment has not only persisted since the 1970s but has also emerged in unexpected places, such as in formal sector enterprises.42 Informal employment offers a survival strategy in countries that do not provide sufficient formal employment opportunities. It is also associated with the lack of social protection, labour legislation and protective measures in the workplace.43 Informal employment is an important source of employment for both women and men in developing countries Informal employment is an important source of employment and livelihoods in many countries. Among 43 countries with available data, it accounted for more than 70 per cent of total non-agricultural employment for women in 15 countries--6 in sub-Saharan Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively, and 3 in Southern and South-Eastern Asia. In 7 of the 15 countries (Bolivia, Guatemala, India, Mali, Nicaragua, Pakistan and the United Republic of Tanzania), a majority of men (more than 70 per cent) working in the non-agriculture sector were also employed informally (figure 4.12). 41 Informal employment comprises the total number of informal jobs whether carried out in formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises or households.

A venture capital company (societe d'investissement en capital a risque, or SICAR) can be set up under a transparent tax regime as a limited partnership or under a nontransparent tax regime as a corporate company. SICARs are approved and supervised by the Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector, but they are subject to few restrictions. They may have a flexible investment policy with no diversification rules or leverage restrictions. SICARs in the form of a corporation benefit from a partial objective exemption regime for income from securities under which losses on disposals and value adjustments made against such investments are not deductible from taxable profits. In addition, SICARs are not subject to subscription tax. For corporations, a dividend withholding tax exemption regime applies. SICARs benefit from a net wealth tax exemption, except that they are subject to the minimum net wealth tax regime and, accordingly, must pay annual net wealth tax under this regime (see Net wealth tax). 992 lu x E m b o u r G Securitization companies.

The other area of concern is human health : unsafe or polluted environments become a threat to human health and wellbeing .	There are a number of points which are repeatedly raised as criticism of the Footprint method. One dimension that the Footprint doesn't have on its radar screen is the toxicity of materials. Why not? Environmental impacts can be divided into two large categories. One area concerns biocapacity questions, or questions of the human material metabolism or its throughput. This is the material exchange between people and nature. In this domain, we run up against quantitative limits. Examples are climate change, freshwater scarcity, or fisheries collapses for instance. The other area of concern is human health: unsafe or polluted environments become a threat to human health and wellbeing. Examples are air or water pollution or heavy metals in soils. This second domain has more of a qualitative dimension: small amounts of the wrong substances affect people's quality of life. Both these environmental impact dimensions are significant, but mixing them up would confuse us. Since they represent different dynamics, they need to be monitored and addressed separately. Therefore the Footprint, a measure of the first domain, needs to be complemented with measures for the second domain. In addition, ecological impact measures need to be accompanied by social and economic information.	The other area of concern is human health: unsafe or polluted environments become a threat to human health and wellbeing.	A big foot on small planet? accounting with the ecological footprint.

Trainers at Kasetsart University have already good experience in training on legumes when they starting the peanut training. Courses were carried out at three levels: (1) international/regional that focused on Southeast Asian scientists, (2) national level for Thai researchers and extension workers, and (3) village level for owners of micro-and small-scale enterprises involving whole villages. Planning and implementation of training courses involved many institutions besides Kasetsart University: other Thai universities such as Khon Kaen University, the Agricultural Extension Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Farmers' and Women's Associations, development projects such as the Thai Princess' Project, other donors such as FAO and USAID, and other stakeholders. The main topics for training were new/improved processing techniques, especially to remove aflatoxin contamination in whole kernels, and use of Elisa technique, a quick method to detect aflatoxin contamination. Participants also learned how to process improved traditional and new peanut products. During the international and national training, Kasetsart University trainors used on-site training methods by bringing the trainees to the villages to experience actually processing of peanut products with village-level micro-and small-scale processors. Overall evaluation of training courses has not been completed, although an impact study of six training workshops held in 2002 is ongoing to determine the impact of training on former participants. During the evaluation, survey data were being encoded, hence, a report was not available.

Mezzanine finance takes place in private capital markets , whose development is thus essential for the diffusion of hybrid instruments .	308. Mezzanine finance takes place in private capital markets, whose development is thus essential for the diffusion of hybrid instruments. Private capital markets are characterised by fewer formal disclosure requirements and a smaller degree of official regulation and formalised investor protection than the public markets, which are open to the general investing public (institutional and retail investors). In most cases, private markets are restricted to professional, institutional or sophisticated investors. 309. The traditional market for commercial mezzanine finance has been upper-tier SMEs, with high credit ratings and demand for funds above EUR 2 million. Securitisation and standardisation of mezzanine instruments are used to facilitate the downsizing of mezzanine finance and access by lower-tier SMEs. Securitisation can contribute to a greater availability of hybrid instruments as banks are able to sell their risk exposures to the financial markets thereby regaining liquidity and the potential to lend more to the SME sector overall (EC, 2007b). 310. Standardisation of mezzanine instruments can reduce the costs of provision and increase transparency and accessibility by SMEs, which may lack knowledge and understanding about hybrid techniques. In fact, the use of mezzanine finance instruments requires a certain level of financial skills on the side of entrepreneurs and SME managers, who often lack awareness and capabilities to understand and access a wider range of financial options than traditional debt. Public programs that aim at increasing access to mezzanine capital by lower-tier SMEs often combine the financing with advice and mentoring.

On-farm and off-farm activities can be complementary in assisting households to manage risk. In other contexts off-farm income has been important in helping small-scale farmers cope with shocks in India (Gaurav 2015), Mozambique (Cunguara et al. 2011), and South America (Bebbington 1999). In Odisha, vulnerable farming communities are characterized by dependence Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ on subsistence rice farming and limited off-farm opportunities (Panda 2016). In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined.

Joint evaluation of support to Anti-Corruption efforts - Bangladesh 5 1.7. Limitations This visit was the first of the five countries and as such was subject to some testing of data collection approaches, described in Chapter 2. Few preparations at country level were completed before the consultant's team arrived which resulted in some delays while documents were assembled and appointments organised with senior officials, though the team did manage to meet most of the stakeholders they wished to. A visit was made to government and NGO programmes in one district outside Dhaka and the findings have been used to inform the evaluation but are not reported separately. 1.8. Report Structure The report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 describes the methodology used. Chapter 3 then looks at the country context for Bangladesh over the period. This leads to a review of the relevance of donor AC programmes in Chapter 4, where the programmes are examined against the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), together with national needs and donor policies. In so far as documented evidence is available or the views of informants can be triangulated, the contribution of these different interventions to broader strategy objectives and key policy themes are also addressed. Chapter 5 looks at how donors have managed their programmes with specific reference to M&E, coordination and alignment with national strategies. In Chapter 6, evidence about the results of the programmes is reviewed with more detailed attention to a number of specific themes. Chapter 7 examines ways in which donors have tackled problems of corruption in the primary education sector and lessons are drawn from that experience. That leads into Chapter 8 where conclusions are identified, followed by broader lessons in Chapter 9 and some recommendations to the commissioning donors in Chapter 10.

An example of good practice in Marracuene and Manhica was the preparation of standard beneficiary lists in collaboration with the external agencies , the communities , and the local authorities .	The community survey in three of the flood-affected areas found that coordination between the local authorities and external agencies was seen by all key informants as one of the positive aspects of the postemergency period. Agencies felt they were able to reach more affected people, reduce duplication, and increase accountability. An example of good practice in Marracuene and Manhica was the preparation of standard beneficiary lists in collaboration with the external agencies, the communities, and the local authorities. Time was taken to ensure the accuracy of the lists was based on a consensus. The lists were regularly updated and used by all agenc ies and the government for the resettlement of the population. However the survey also found that although district authorities were able to maintain a certain level of coordination of post flood interventions through committees and regular meetings with external agencies, the balance of power remained with the agencies. The success of the coordination work depended very much on the philosophies of the external agencies and their commitment to coordination measures, rather than the organizational ability of the local government. Agencies were often reluctant to be fully transparent about their resource allocations and plans, and individual agency agendas could tend to dominate. In Vilanculos however, it has been possible for the district coordination mechanism to be institutionalized, which in late 2002 aided drought relief activities in the province.

To start with the term itself, a child is defined in international law as ""every human being below the age of 18 years, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier"".2 Data on youth migration do not always use this cut-off point, however, so reference is often made to ""youth migration"".

It can span the range from unproblematic family relocation to traumatic forced displacement caused by the violence of war, attempts at ethnic cleansing or State disintegration. The migration of children includes both journeys where children accompany adult relatives and situations where children need to undertake journeys alone; it includes situations that result in enduring improvements to the quality of children's lives, in terms of educational opportunity or familial security, and situations where exposure to exploitation or risk leads to enduring trauma."

A Typical Letter of Credit Transaction Here are the typical steps in issuing an irrevocable letter of credit that has been confirmed by a U.S. bank: 1. After the exporter and the buyer have agreed on the terms of a sale, the buyer arranges for its bank to open a letter of credit that specifies the documents needed for payment. The buyer determines which documents will be required. 2. The buyer's bank issues (opens) its irrevocable letter of credit and includes all instructions to the seller relating to the shipment. 3. The buyer's bank sends its irrevocable letter of credit to a U.S. bank and requests confirmation. The exporter may request that a particular U.S. bank be the confirming bank, or the foreign bank may select a U.S. correspondent bank. 4. The U.S. bank prepares a letter of confirmation to forward to the exporter, along with the irrevocable letter of credit. 5. The exporter carefully reviews all conditions in the letter of credit. The exporter's freight forwarder is contacted to make sure that the shipping date can be met. If the exporter cannot comply with one or more of the conditions, the customer is alerted at once because an amendment may be necessary. 6. The exporter arranges with the freight forwarder to deliver the goods to the appropriate port or airport. 7. When the goods are loaded aboard the exporting carrier, the freight forwarder completes the necessary documentation. 8. The exporter (or the freight forwarder) presents the documents, evidencing full compliance with the letter of credit terms, to the U.S. bank. 9. The bank reviews the documents. If they are in order, the documents are sent to the buyer's bank for review and then transmitted to the buyer. 10. The buyer (or the buyer's agent) uses the documents to claim the goods. 11. A sight or time draft accompanies the letter of credit. A sight draft is paid on presentation; a time draft is paid within a specified time period.

Part 2 Ecological accounting humans and wild living plants and animals will increase .	"Suggestions for further work: What changes occur when biological diversity decreases? Part 2 Ecological accounting humans and wild living plants and animals will increase. The question will become: Who gets the fish - the sea lion or the human? Can declining population trends in species be reversed? If we wanted to put a full stop to human activities that lead to endangered and extinct species, we would need to make drastic changes in our living habits. It would likely require taking portions of land used by humans, and returning them to their natural state. It would also require changing our eating habits significantly. We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions, and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort. Biological diversity is not equally distributed throughout the world. Many biodiversity hotspots lie in Central America and western Amazonia, in the Cape area of South Africa, and in the mountains and plains of East Africa. Other regions rich in biodiversity include the coastal regions and islands of the Mediterranean, Southwest China, and the bordering areas from Burma to Vietnam. Large parts of Madagascar also belong to this list, as do numerous islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. When faced with the extinction of valuable biodiversity, is it sufficient to view the Earth exclusively as potentially productive area for humans? Or is our planet more than a source of raw materials for human consumption and a carbon dioxide sink for human waste? To enable sustainable development, scientists, politicians and members of civil society will have to take action, individually and collectively, to protect the Earth's diversity of ecosystems, genes and species, while maintaining a high quality of life for humans. Suggestion for further work: a mental game Imagine that people and biodiversity are ""playing chess"". Both want ""the fish"", the ever decreasing natural resources."

"In the isolated rural areas of Mozambique, the interior of Chokwe and Inhambane, the delivery mechanisms for the interventions were accepted by the communities, and generally consisted of local authorities, traditional leaders and external agencies working together to distribute goods and direct interventions. However, in the more densely populated areas, on the main roads (Chokwe and Marracuene) there was less trust within the communities and between the communities and the local government representatives. People complained of a lack of coordinated responses and suspected corruption. The differences may be attributed to the relative complexity of the livelihoods and livelihood strategies in the different areas and the breakdown of traditional trust bonds in the more urban influenced areas. In the remote rural areas the communities necessarily rely on one another socially and economically, and livelihood strategies are relatively less complex. Households in these communities generally know about the livelihoods of the different families in the community and are easily able to identify the richer and poorer members of the community. As was stated in Lhate (Chokwe), ""we are all the same family, same culture and tradition."" Local leaders in this situation are bound by strong ties to the community, creating, in general, higher degrees of trust. However, in the more densely populated areas (usually closer to cities) this homogeneity is not apparent. Households have more diverse livelihood strategies, including trading, and the communities are not as stable. The local leaders are often secluded from the households and are treated with suspicion. Unclear delivery processes and communities' lack of information can lead to distrust and the community feeling as if it were not included in the decision making process. A community member in Chokwe stated, ""We just see construction material passing us by, to and fro, to and fro, and never staying with us, it seems to stop in one of the homes of the leaders, who knows!"""

Guidelines for applying protected area management categories Protected areas Protected areas are essential for biodiversity conservation. They are the cornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation strategies, set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or endemic species from becoming extinct. They are complementary to measures to achieve conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity outside protected areas in accordance with CBD guidelines such as the Malawi and Addis Ababa Principles (CBD VII/11-12). Most protected areas exist in natural or near-natural ecosystems, or are being restored to such a state, although there are exceptions. Many contain major features of earth history and earth processes while others document the subtle interplay between human activity and nature in cultural landscapes. Larger and more natural protected areas also provide space for evolution and future ecological adaptation and restoration, both increasingly important under conditions of rapid climate change.

Gender-specific labour demands in receiving countries stimulate the extent of labour migration of women and men. This is the case, for example, in the demand for domestic workers and nurses in developed regions, or demand for workers in the oil and construction industries in Western Asia. Gender norms and stereotypes in both countries of origin and destination, reinforced by formal education and training programmes, define jobs such as domestic workers and nurses as more suitable for women, and jobs in the oil industry or construction as more suitable for men.36 Labour market integration can be particularly challenging for women migrants. Many women are often ineligible for social benefits and mainstream support as they enter the host country under the family reasons category, and if their partners also work. Integration is usually particularly difficult for women migrants in countries where the employment of women is generally low.37 Nevertheless, migrant women still have more work opportunities than in their countries of origin, and tend to be more inte- 36 OECD, 2014; United Nations, 2006; Widmaier and Dumont, 2011. 37 OECD, 2014.

As countries grow and urbanize , the demand for protein-rich food products , higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases .	Fifth, the dietary transformation following income growth and urbanization also opens up new demand for agricultural products and employment on, and increasingly also, offthe farm in the value chains. As countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases. After Engel's Law, this is the second large Law of Demand, named after Bennett. This also opens up new jobs opportunities, directly in the production of these products (dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables), and indirectly in the associated chains (storage, transport, processing, packaging, wholesale, and retail). The production of high-value agricultural products tends to be more labor intensive (see also Figure3.6), while jobs in the agricultural value chain (especially in agro-processing) are often taken up by women (Table 2.2). Together they add better earning and more inclusive jobs, mitigating the decline of jobs in staple crop production as increasing labor productivity in staple production releases labor (given less than unit income elasticity of demand for staples) and the structural transformation proceeds.

As jobs in the fac tories became available to women, it is likely that parents saw more employment opportunities for their daughters and realized the importance of education. The women working in these garment factories thus set an example for other women and girls.

Children from rural environments are significantly less enrolled for the school. Of all students initially enrolled, 25-33 percent do not complete primary school (Richards, 2008, p.19). In Bangladesh, English was introduced during British rule and still enjoys a position of dominance and prestige (Hamid, Sussex & Khan, 2009, p.284). English is taught as a compulsory subject from the first to the 12th grade and also at the tertiary level in Bangladesh.

Norway has continued to dismantle tariffs on industrial products on a unilateral basis. Norway's Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on nonagricultural products averages 0.5 percent, and more than 95 percent of industrial tariff lines are currently duty free. Norway bound its agricultural tariffs in 1995 as part of its WTO commitments. Tariffication of agricultural nontariff barriers as a result of the Uruguay Round led to the replacement of several quotas on agricultural products with high ad valorem or specific tariffs. According to the WTO, in 2017 Norway's most favored nation applied tariff was 42.1 percent for agricultural goods and 0.5 percent for nonagricultural goods. Although the EEA accord does not generally apply to agricultural products, it includes provisions on raw material price compensation that are meant to increase trade in processed food.

Permanent cultivation of upland rice is practiced in many Asian and Latin American countries. This is characterized by orderly intercropping, relay cropping, and sequential cropping with several crops. The largest area of permanent upland rice cultivation is in eastern India. In the Chhattisgarh Plateau area of Jharkand and Bihar, rainfall will support only a single upland crop per season. Rice may be grown continuously or rotated with legumes and pasture. Rice yields in continuous production tend to be very low (around 1 t/ha) because of nematode buildup and other biotic factors that are not well understood, but yields in rotation with legumes may exceed 2 t/ha.

Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country.

Improved germplasm , which involves identifying progenitors for crossing , evaluating segregating material , and carrying out yield trials .	Improved rice gene pools The objective of this work is to increase rice genetic diversity and enhance gene pools for higher and more stable yields. This research has five steps: 1. Improved germplasm, which involves identifying progenitors for crossing, evaluating segregating material, and carrying out yield trials. 2. Improved populations (recurrent selection), requiring evaluation/ recombination of gene pools, development of blast resistance through recurrent selection, development of indica gene pools with a higher response to anther culture, enhanced pest and disease resistance, high yield potential, and excellent quality. 3. Identification and use of genes from wild germplasm. First, useful wild germplasm and its traits are identified, followed by International rice research and development 57 interspecific crosses and the development of backcross populations. These populations undergo quantitative trait loci analysis and suitable isogenic lines are produced for release as advanced lines. Anther culture is used to speed up the process. 4. Determination of the physiological basis for yield enhancement and adaptation to abiotic stresses. These traits are characterized from wild rice and nutrient uptake is investigated under low pH and high Al conditions. 5. Developing marker-aided selection, part of a long-term strategy to give rice breeders another tool, allowing them to incorporate even more traits into enhanced gene pools.

What could be the longer term impact of technological change on banking and finance? Technology will play a big role and could fundamentally change the way that the financial system works. Although it is very difficult to predict exactly how this will play out, both banking and particularly the asset management industry could be particularly ripe for disruption. Advances in digital technology could enable more and more people to move towards self-directed investment using online platforms, fundamentally changing how the current industry works. I see this as a huge growth area going forwards for new entrants. There is also an interesting question as to where technological innovation will come from in future. Traditionally, it has mostly come from areas like Silicon Valley, but with success stories such as Alibaba in China, it may be the case that we will start to see more innovation coming from the East. This will reinforce other factors shifting global economic power in that direction.	I see this as a huge growth area going forwards for new entrants.

Gender-based occupational segregation also reflects the difference between women and men in terms of their choice of education and vocational training ( see Chapter 2 on Education ) .	Women and men tend to work in different occupations (horizontal segregation) and in different positions within the same occupation or occupational group (vertical segregation). The segregation of women and men in different occupations is closely associated with gender roles or stereotypes about women (for example, that they are caring or home-based). Gender-based occupational segregation also reflects the difference between women and men in terms of their choice of education and vocational training (see Chapter 2 on Education). Occupational segregation can negatively affect the flexibility of the labour market30 and the economy as a whole. It also has direct negative effects on women in particular, partly because women's employment is concentrated in a more limited number of occupations than that of men.31 Such concentration imposes more restrictions on women than on men in terms of what types of jobs they can undertake. Occupational segregation, both horizontal and vertical, also contributes greatly to the pay differentials between women and men (see section in this chapter on the gender pay gap). 30 Segregation causes labour market inflexibility because it constrains mobility between male and female occupations. When a firm needs a large group of new workers for an industry that is clearly male-or female-dominated, it may not find a sufficient number of qualified candidates for the posts. Source: Melkas and Anker, 1997. 31 A study covering 41 countries showed that there are seven times more male-dominated occupations than female-dominated occupations--defined as an occupation in which either men or women, respectively, comprise at least 80 per cent of workers.

Given that manufacturing jobs connect to exSource : World Development Report 2013 team estimates based on data from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) database and United Nations Statistics Division .	"The East Asian trends are consistent with the ""flying geese"" pattern of development, where economic transformation is consistent with dynamic changes in comparative advantage. Industrialization in East Asian countries began with the development of labor-intensive sectors, gradually shifted to capital-intensive sectors, and then to knowledge-intensive activities. In parallel, wages rose and skills increased.35 First Japan, then Korea, and more recently China followed a similar pattern. As labor costs increase further, light manufacturing jobs are likely to migrate away from coastal China, where most industries have concentrated. By some estimates, nearly 100 million jobs are at stake.36 The migration of light manufacturing jobs out of coastal China could open a once-in-ageneration opportunity for countries in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia to jump-start their industrialization. But some observers predict that the migration will go mainly to the inland areas in China, where wage rates are lower than on the coast. This would be consistent with the patterns of industrialization in Japan; Korea; Taiwan, China; and the United States, where the initial geographical concentration of industries was followed by dispersion within the same country.37 However, China's labor market is relatively integrated to the point where even unskilled wage rates in rural areas have been increasing rapidly.38 Therefore, an overall decline in the manufacturing share of GDP in China might be unavoidable, opening up the opportunity for labor-intensive industrialization in other developing countries.39 The rapid growth of labor productivity in manufacturing is resulting in the stagnation or even the decline of the number of manufacturing jobs worldwide (figure 7.2). Global employment in manufacturing increased by only 30 percent from 1990 to 2008, with most of the expansion taking place in Asia, especially in China.

While they contribute to 50 percent of the overall export value, export crops are only about a quarter of the value of total agricultural output. Food crops make up the rest (75 percent). Two in five farmers grow both cash and food crops (44 percent). About one-third grows only cash crops --they are richer on average. One in four (24 percent) grows only food crops --they are poorer on average. Traditionally, cash crops have received the most attention. These numbers would suggest greater attention to food crop growers and raising food crop productivity. This could also help raise labor productivity among women, who tend to be more engaged in the food cropping system 54 (Camara 1984; Chaleard 1988).

The movement of labor out of agriculture has been facilitated by close urban proximity, resulting from Bangladesh's high population density. Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors. The ready- Urbanizing countries Urbanizing countries endowed with abundant unskilled labor have the potential to enter a virtuous jobs circle. The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities, especially in light manufacturing. These jobs may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and limited or negligible benefits, but in general they are preferable to jobs in agriculture. They can also be the entry point to a process of economic and technological upgrading that leads to better jobs in the future.34 Employment opportunities for the unskilled thus provide avenues out of poverty for large numbers of households.

This has implications for the global distribution of human capital and poverty , as well as the burden of disease .	The world's population in 2015 is estimated at 7.3 billion people--1.6 billion more than two decades ago. Currently, 83 per cent of the global population (6 billion people) live in developing regions and that share is increasing. This has implications for the global distribution of human capital and poverty, as well as the burden of disease. The developed regions are home to the remaining 17 per cent (1.3 billion). The share of the world's population living in developing regions is as follows: an estimated 45 per cent are concentrated in Eastern and Southern Asia; 14 per cent in Sub-Saharan Africa; and almost 9 per cent each in South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Taken together, the remaining developing regions (the Caucasus and Central Asia, Northern Africa, Oceania and Western Asia) represent less than 7 per cent of the global population.1 The proportion of children is declining in most countries around the world One of the most notable demographic changes in the past few decades has been the transition of the population to an older structure. Population ageing--an increase in the share of people in older age groups and a reduction in the proportion of children--is the result of a decrease in fertility and increased longevity. The global share of children aged 0 to 14 declined from 32 per cent in 1995 to 26 per cent in 2015. The decline is more pronounced in developed regions, but occurs in most countries around the world. Currently, the proportion of children in developed regions is low, at 17 per cent, compared to 28 per cent in developing regions. One region with a low proportion of children is Eastern Asia (18 per cent), dominated by population dynamics in China and its long-standing one-child policy. At the other extreme, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of children in the population, at 43 per cent.2 1 United Nations, 2013a. 2 ibid.

However, in such countries as India, Lebanon, Nigeria and Bangladesh it is common for mainstream teachers to provide supplementary tutoring for their own mainstream pupils (Bray, 2006, p.519). Some tutoring is provided one to one in the home of either the tutor or his/ her tutees. Other tutoring is in small groups, in large classes or even in huge lecture-theatres with video screens.

Household air pollution may especially be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where in 2013 more than half of the population still used solid fuels for cooking and heating. Even in the Americas and Europe, the regions where use of solid fuels is the lowest, the population using solid fuels is still significant at 25 per cent in the Americas and 23 per cent in Europe.350 Furthermore, available data from 14 developing countries, around 2010, show that in all countries a higher proportion of households with persons with disabilities than without persons with disabilities cooks with wood or coal (Figure II.73). On average, 53 per cent of households with persons with disabilities versus 46 per cent of households without persons with disabilities use these traditional forms of energy for cooking. The percentages of households with persons with disabilities that cook with wood and/or coal vary from 1.4 per cent in Iran to 97 per cent in Tanzania. Households with persons with disabilities in rural areas are particularly affected, as the wood and coal are used for cooking in 66 per cent of these households compared to only 32 per cent of households with persons with disabilities in urban areas, on average (Figure II.74). In all these countries, the proportion of households with persons with disabilities cooking with coal and/or wood is higher in rural areas than in urban areas.

The Thai training project has developed a cadre of peanut food technology scientists who continue to network to share information about peanut research and product development .	Main beneficiaries of this training project are Thai villagers, both consumers and micro-processors, at the community level. They are mainly women involved in producing traditional peanut products and have learned new/improved, optimized and standardized peanut products from the training. They have benefited from the training on manual sorting technology to produce aflatoxin-free peanut products, and improved packaging. Their new enterprise has become a main source of cash income for the family. Thai scientists, researchers, extension workers, and the private food industry representatives have benefited from the sustained training efforts since Phase 1 of the project. Many have become excellent trainers for the continuing international, national, and village-level training in Thailand. Another group of beneficiaries are Southeast Asian scientists/researchers who have participated in the international courses funded partly by Peanut CRSP on Peanut Processing, Packaging, and Utilization Technologies held at Kasetsart University in Bangkok. Participants have ongoing projects or were expected to initiate food technology-related activities in their own countries after their training.

The case studies were done after the quantitative survey was completed. Sampling for the case study narratives was done with the objective of selecting men and women with variation in household type (single female or dual adult) as well as in WEAI scores. In each country, enumerators worked with local leaders in two villages to purposefully select a total of 14 women and 6 men (20 per country) to be case study participants. Selection was split between women and men who were perceived to have high, medium, and low empowerment levels in agriculture. In total, 60 case study narratives were collected and transcribed into English with accompanying photographs and, in some cases, video footage. The pilot (or quantitative) portions of their data were entered and scored in the same way as the pilot data. These individuals' scores were checked to see whether they agreed with the general narrative and local perceptions (self-perceptions and perceptions of local leaders) of a person's empowerment.

The use of job-related words as household identifiers shows that people associated themselves with what they did. Nowadays, people aspire to choose their jobs based on what motivates them and on what could make their lives more meaningful. In almost every language there are also several words to express the lack of a job. Almost invariably these words have a negative connotation, close in spirit to deprivation; at times they even carry an element of stigma. In all these ways, language conveys the idea that jobs are more than what people earn, or what they do at work: they are also part of who they are.

Civil society actors , especially those critically monitor and politically mobilise for the rights of migrants in Europe , have faced prosecutions and criminal convictions when assisting this population .	Many IJMBS articles examined the shifting conception of borders as tools of governance and as boundaries of belonging. A perfect illustration is the 'anticipatory interdiction' measures implemented by Canada to manage the geopolitical 'threat' posed by asylum claimants from Mexico. Measures such as the United StatesCanada Safe Third Country Agreement, the Mexican visa imposition, and the safe country of origin scheme formed a virtual border to effectively filter and exclude migrants from Mexico. In a similar vein, the EU border control regime generated exclusion and precarity of migrants during the so-called 'European refugee crisis' in 2015. As an IJMBS contribution put it, when over a million people reached Europe, intense political debate on the 'crisis' has prevented public opinion from seeing how its root causes lie in the intrinsic weaknesses of the solidarity and responsibility sharing mechanisms in the EU. Indeed another article argued that the EU's political priority to counter migrant smuggling affected the provision of humanitarian assistance and access to rights for irregular immigrants and asylum seekers. Civil society actors, especially those critically monitor and politically mobilise for the rights of migrants in Europe, have faced prosecutions and criminal convictions when assisting this population. Authors pointed almost invariably to the pressing issue of ensuring transparency and accountability at the border.

Box 3.4 Learning achievement of girls and boys The main purpose of any education system is to impart skills to young people so that they can effectively participate in the social, economic and political life. Getting children into school is not an end in itself. The ultimate measure of success is not only the extent to which children learn, but the quality of their education experience. Student assessment surveys provide a measure for assessing learning outcomes and the quality of education. Such surveys allow some assessment to be made of the relative achievements of girls and boys in terms of the subjects they study in school. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)--which surveys school performance among 15-yearolds around the world, particularly in reading, mathematics and science--makes it possible to measure disparities among and within countries in terms of the skills students attain after a given period of learning. Typically, this is done after about eight years of schooling, near the end of compulsory education in many countries.	Getting children into school is not an end in itself.

The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it?

Women's underrepresentation in top positions in the private sector is increasingly perceived not only as a fairness and equality issue but also as a performance issue, since some studies show that gender diversity within corporate management is associated with improved performance.82 Yet, women remain a minority among senior managers in the private sector. Some of the main obstacles to women's representation in managerial positions are linked to less favourable employment conditions, including the exclusion of part-time workers and irregular workers from career advancement, and inequality in sharing domestic and family responsibilities (see Chapter 4 on Work). A study showed that while women and men have similar ambitions to become top managers, women are less likely to perceive that they can succeed in doing so.83 This is consistent with persistent gender stereotypes among the general population. The World Values Survey asked people for the 2010-2014 round whether they agreed with the statement that, on the whole, men made better business executives than women. The proportion of the population sharing this opinion ranged widely--from 8 per cent in the Netherlands and Sweden to 80 per cent in Egypt--showing that some countries still lagged behind in terms of attitudes and values towards gender equality.84 80 European Commission, 2015a (database accessed 11 March 2015). 81 According to the source, part-time regular persons are those who work less than full time and are on the regular, continuing payroll of the organization; part-time contract persons are those who work part time on a fixed-term contract arrangement.

Considerably more than half of the per capita Footprint originates through carbon dioxide emissions, i.e., through the energy used for transportation, manufacturing and heating. A great potential for energy efficiency can be deduced from these numbers. For instance: the Footprint of a normal Berlin rental property could be reduced by approximately four global hectares by insulating its facades. That is an area the size of the Nicolas Lake in the district of Zehlendorf - for one single house. Comparing the results for different forms of transportation is especially compelling. Someone who uses the subway to get to work requires 200 times less area than someone who sits alone in his car.

Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted , albeit somewhat passively , to resume their livelihoods .	Remarkably few evaluations have been done of the recovery period, so it is not possible to make a definitive judgment on the effectiveness and impact of the recovery processes after the 2000 floods. However, Mozambique's recovery from the 2000 floods broadly appears to have been effective and generally well handled. The 2000 floods in Mozambique demonstrated clearly that it is possible to make an impact and carry out extensive recovery activities when the disaster is high profile and the amount of money donated to the affected populations is large. Recovery programs provided an opportunity for investments in upgraded services and infrastructure. Evidence from the community survey illustrated many ways in which some affected populations have been assisted, albeit somewhat passively, to resume their livelihoods. On the negative side, asset depletion has been neglected in the post-emergency period. Increased social capital was the most important positive aspect for affected populations. There are indications that some of the new social structures created - associations, community committees and resettlement areas - will strengthen the safety net for future disasters, but it is too early to state categorically that this will be a lasting effect of the post-emergency interventions. Breaking the isolation of the rural communities through the provision of roads and bridges may be judged at a later date to be the single most important, long-term achievement of the recovery interventions. The importance of infrastructure construction and rehabilitation should not be underestimated when preparing contingency plans and developing a set of interventions to be considered post-emergency. In terms of Mozambique's development of its disaster preparedness and mitigation plan, much will depend on the level of commitment given to it by the government and by donors. The importance of this area is shown when a devastating disaster (of the kind experienced in 2000) occurs, but institutional memories can be short and other priorities may dominate, particularly in economic and political areas. It is also a question of whether disaster management issues can be maintained as priorities when government budgets are likely to be under increasing pressure. xiii .

In Central America and the Caribbean, circumstances such as poverty, social inequality and a lack of economic opportunities for young people have contributed to an increase in drug trafficking. The migration situation in Central American countries is one of the most complex in the world, with many thousands of migrants arriving, transiting and departing every year. The easily accessible coasts of Jamaica have been used increasingly by various criminal networks to use the country as a transit and destination country for smuggling drugs, firearms, ammunition and migrants. 369. Cocaine continues to be trafficked from the border area between Colombia and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) to airstrips in Central America and the Caribbean, in addition to the use of the more established sea routes via Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In terms of maritime trafficking, remote coastal areas of Honduras and parts of northern Nicaragua are also used. Once offloaded, shipments are moved further north by air.28 In Nicaragua, most cocaine is seized in remote, underpopulated and isolated areas along the Atlantic coast. 370. Drug trafficking by sea remains a major problem in Central America and the Caribbean. In addition, light aircraft operating from clandestine airstrips in remote areas of South America are increasingly being used to transport cocaine. More and more often, drug traffickers use stolen or falsified aircraft registration numbers when transporting illicit consignments by air. INCB encourages Governments to monitor the sale and movement of light aircraft more closely, step up airspace security and strengthen control over privately owned landing fields.

"The global Regulatory Atlas in fall 2016, NCSBN hosted the landmark Regulation 2030 conference. Regulation 2030 brought together nursing regulators and leaders from eight countries, nursing professional organizations, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and other groups. These attendees were tasked with mapping the future of nursing regulation in the following categories: (a) governance, (b) processes, (c) licensure and registration, (d) workforce, (e) education, (f) fitness for practice, and (g) technology. The Regulation 2030 Conference identified data, collaboration, and standardization as major thematic requirements that would enable the evolution of nursing regulation. Specifically, participants imagined the harmonization of regulatory processes around the world, including the optimized capture and sharing of data across nations and continents. As a step toward future outcomes, and keeping with the recognition of data sharing, collaboration, and standardization as keys to delivering those outcomes, NCSBN determined that there was no efficient method for comparing the governance and processes by which nurses are regulated around the world. Therefore, a single resource containing data on the state of nursing regulation in each country that was digital, searchable, and allowed easy comparison across jurisdictions was needed. This resource ultimately became known as the Global Regulatory Atlas. This special issue, ""Global Profile of Nursing Regulation, Education, and Practice,"" summarizes the rich data contained within Global Regulatory Atlas into an enlightening anthology that captures the similarities, differences and details of nursing around the world. A Glossary of frequently used terms in the Atlas and in this report is included in Appendix A. This data is presented in two parts. Part I reports data and findings from a global perspective. Part II reports this data from a regional perspective. Note that some jurisdictions or regions do not have data listed in every category for various reasons, including that the data were not available or collected and documented in their region."

Countries narrowed their gap with other subregions in areas related to natural and cultural tourism , building their case as a travel destination .	The Balkans and Eastern Europe subregion has a lower T&T share of GDP than most other European subregions, but the countries here are the most dependent on international tourist arrivals for internal T&T spending. Consequently, there is a need to improve competitiveness to keep arrivals coming to maximize the subregion's T&T potential. Within this context, the Balkans and Eastern Europe had one of the fastest rates of improvement in T&T competitiveness of all the subregions. Countries narrowed their gap with other subregions in areas related to natural and cultural tourism, building their case as a travel destination. Enhanced T&T prioritization, tourist service infrastructure and price competitiveness (the subregion's strongest relative advantage to the rest of Europe) have reinforced this case; Balkan and Eastern European countries are diverting more resource to the industry, making travel more convenient and less expensive. In part thanks to these trends, subregional arrivals picked up--as more airlines are now offering flights--thereby expanding route capacity.

In Bangladesh, the Directorate General of Health Services has scaled up the National Health Call Centre as a national COVID-19 helpline assisted by over 3,800 qualified clinicians and counsellors. From 8 March to 24 April 2020, the helpline served over 23,000 callers, providing access to medical advice without physical contact (DGHS, 2020b). In Kenya, the MoH has set up a national toll-free number and short message service to facilitate access to relevant medical information and offer advice to anyone with relevant signs and symptoms. In Pakistan, the existing national polio eradication helpline has been redesigned as a COVID-19 hotline and receives an average of 70,000 calls a day. There are numerous established telemedicine services in Pakistan, and many have added COVID-19 risk screen capacity. Like the national helpline, they are becoming an increasingly important platform to respond to queries, provide correct information, and connect clients to a service provider when needed. In Sierra Leone, the nationwide 117 hotline46 set up during the Ebola outbreak has been repurposed to serve as a unified alert notification and medical helpline, in an effort to maximise efficiency and reduce physical overcrowding at healthcare facilities. In Uganda, supported by partners, the two biggest telecommunications companies have provided the MoH with technical assistance to establish a set of toll-free COVID-19 numbers capable of handling the expected call volume from the general public. These hotlines provide information and are also intended to assist with reporting suspected cases in the community.

Only 28 percent of agricultural households rely exclusively on family labor. This suggests substantial agricultural wage labor opportunities. Nonetheless only a very small share of the rural population reports to work as agricultural wage laborer (2.7 percent), suggesting that agricultural labor needs are often met by migrant laborers from neighboring countries. Both phenomena (low incidence of agricultural wage labor and high use of hired labor) are otherwise difficult to reconcile.

Country Notes Primary education lasts for six years and is compulsory. However the draft Constitution recommends that there be nine years of compulsory education. Admission to secondary education is, at present, based on an intra-school examination not a national Baccaluria. Secondary education covers six years divided into two three-year cycles: grades 7 to 9 in middle school (Maktabeh Motevaseteh) and grades 10 to 12 at high school (Doreyeh Aali). At the end of the first cycle, pupils sit for an examination. At the end of the second cycle, they sit for intra-school examinations. Technical secondary education is offered in the lower and upper secondary cycle at middle schools in such subjects as Commerce, Applied Arts, Teacher Training, Agriculture and Civil Aviation. Courses lead to a Baccaluria equivalent level qualification. A structure of eight years of general basic education followed by four years of secondary education had been introduced for a few years during the educational reform of 1975.

We offer a full range of expertise in international trade , marketing , and finance .	International banking specialists are generally well informed about export matters, even in areas that fall outside the usual limits of international banking. Banks frequently provide consultation and guidance free of charge to their clients because they derive income from loans to the exporter and from fees for special services, such as letters of credit and other kinds of funds transfer. Many banks also have publications available to help exporters. These materials are often devoted to particular countries and their business practices, and they may be a valuable tool for familiarization with a foreign industry. Also, large banks frequently conduct seminars and workshops on letters of credit, documentary collections, and other banking subjects of concern to exporters. The U.S. Commercial Service works closely with state and local governments as well as private partners. We offer a full range of expertise in international trade, marketing, and finance. 53Chapter 4: Export Advice A commercial bank can perform many services for its clients, such as: * Exchange of currencies * Assistance in financing exports * Collection of foreign invoices, drafts, letters of credit, and other foreign receivables * Transfer of funds to other countries * Letters of introduction and letters of credit for travelers * Credit information on potential representatives or buyers overseas * Credit assistance to the exporter's foreign buyers Export Intermediaries Export intermediaries range from giant international companies to highly specialized small operations. For a fee, they provide a multitude of services, including performing market research, appointing and managing overseas distributors or commission representatives, exhibiting a client's products at international trade shows, advertising, and shipping and preparing documentation. In short, the intermediary can often take full responsibility for the export end of business, relieving the exporter of all details except filling orders.

Underneath these sectoral and spatial changes in the structure of employment are the firm dynamics connecting job flows and productivity growth. Aggregate productivity grows when existing firms become better at what they do, when more productive firms enter the market, and when less productive ones exit. It also grows when more productive firms become bigger and less productive ones become smaller.

In settings where women and men do not have equal access to health services, as in some parts of Asia, inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene may result in more female than male deaths.

Before visiting Guyana, not much had been learned of the Peanut CRSP project other than the fact that an early focus on production and subsequent abundant yields caused a flooding of the local available market and a subsequent downward pressure on prices. This outcome had left the local participants with less income earnings from product for which there was no market. Subsequently, there was doubt about being able to turn the situation around in the future. Government support through School Feeding Program had been recently decided and would be a first round solution to the initial problem of over supply. By purchasing the locally produced peanut butter for the school feeding program, the government would insure the demand and a market outlet. This would virtually stabilize expected incomes in the short run.

What does this all have to do with nature preservation and conservation areas ?	"Preparations for the Youth Summit took place in the country cabins and other traditional dwellings in the International Wilderness Camp in the Bavarian Forest National Park. With the support of the GTZ and the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU, see the Infobox on pg. 90) and a network of cooperation partners, the International Wilderness Camp was built as a place for sustainable development educational activities. It conveys an impression of the diverse ways of life in our world. The summit participants were accommodated in lodgings that are typical for the National Park's partner conservation programs in Benin, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Vietnam, Siberia, the Czech Republic, and Mongolia. Within 10 days in the International Wilderness Camp, the young people developed the political messages and creative artistic contributions that were introduced above. But the Footprint was not only a central theme during the Youth Summit. Just like other overarching topics such as climate change and resource consumption, it forms a regular part of the weeklong educational programs for school classes and youth groups. These take place in the country cabins of the International Wilderness Camp. The students, who live in the traditional dwellings, try to understand the topics from the perspectives of their ""host countries"" or the conservation areas which are partners of the Bavarian Forest National Park. The central questions of the week-long program, which is conceived for students in their 10th to 13th school year, are: What is behind the idea of the Footprint? How large is our country's Footprint and those of other countries? What does this all have to do with nature preservation and conservation areas? What role does each of us play in this? ""Living well within the means of one planet"" - Is this at all possible? If yes, how? The ""Chair Metaphor"", the ""Loop Game"" or the ""Quotation Line"" serve as educational starting points."

The tragic September 2015 drowning of Alan Kurdi and the international outrage provoked by the United States Government 's 2018 southern border family separation policy exemplify this .	Another factor galvanizing increased political will and public concern about child migration is the peculiarly newsworthy and compelling nature of child suffering. The tragic September 2015 drowning of Alan Kurdi and the international outrage provoked by the United States Government's 2018 southern border family separation policy exemplify this. So does the growing acknowledgement of the life-changing impact of aspects of the migration process for very large numbers of child migrants.4 Policies that separate parents from their children at borders or through deportation proceedings, as well as protracted administrative procedures that prevent children from reunifying with parents for years, can be devastating for the health and well-being of affected children.5 Dramatic impacts for children also flow from other migration-related contexts: the absence of life-saving rescue procedures to pre-empt child drowning or fatal dehydration during migration journeys; 6 educational shortcomings in refugee camps;7 State inaction in the face of evidence of migrant child sexual exploitation;8 and unmet physical and mental health needs for displaced children.9 This chapter examines unsafe international child migration, and the ongoing tension between migration governance and child protection imperatives.10 The chapter starts by detailing the different types of child migration globally, including their drivers, and issues related to the data on child migration. Next, it discusses key protection challenges affecting child migrants before going on to address current issues and evolving policies relating to them. The chapter then explores the main emerging challenges confronting child migrants. It concludes by reflecting on achievements and priorities still in need of attention.

In this context, a broader jobs strategy that centers on 'better jobs' and the issue of 'productive inclusion' for the poor, women and rural populations could address more directly the central challenges of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity in the short to medium term. The objective of an inclusive jobs strategy would go well beyond counting the number of new formal wage jobs created. It would seek to improve earnings and inclusive employment across all occupations, including in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment where the majority of the population will remain employed for the foreseeable future. As such, the rest of this report invites to expand policy discussions on employment from a focus on the number of jobs and unemployment to a broader attention to the quality, inclusiveness, and productivity of jobs. BOX 1.6: IMPACTS OF LABOR-INTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMS ON EMPLOYMENT QUALITY The impact evaluation of the labor-intensive public works program of the Youth Employment and Skills Development Project (PEJEDEC) illustrates how employment programs can increase employment quality in Coted'Ivoire. Shortterm results show that the public works program only increases slightly the share of youths who are employed. This is consistent with the observation that unemployment is relatively low and that most youths are engaged in informal jobs. In this context, the main impact of the program is to change the composition of employment by allowing youths to access better-paying wage jobs. Beyond impacts on economic indicators, participation in the public works program also improves attitudes and ""psychological well-being"", including self-esteem and aspirations towards the future. Overall, youths' well-being improves strongly during the program."

For the country to grasp these opportunities, agricultural labor productivity will need to be made competitive with off-farm opportunities in the cities.

There are significant variations in educational attainment across regions, suggesting a strong association with the general level of social and economic development. In developed regions, where universal primary education has been attained, the proportions of women and men with no schooling or whose highest attainment is at the primary level are small, while those whose highest attainment is at or above the secondary level are substantial.

"Crop modeling to integrate knowledge Crop modeling enables researchers to integrate knowledge from different disciplines in a quantitative way. That, in turn, helps researchers to understand the underlying processes that determine the behavior of complex agricultural systems. Mathematical models are representations of systems made from mathematical equations. Integrating and solving the equations enable a numerical description of the system to be produced. During the first phase of a modeling exercise, the modeler seeks to give names, magnitudes, and units to the component parts of the problem. In the second phase of modeling a problem, the processes are described as mathematical functions. In the final phase, ""what-if"" questions can be asked about the functioning of a system and numerical answers provided. Mathematical models that contain no clear logical link with the basic processes governing the relationship between the system inputs and outputs are unlikely to contribute much of significance to any debate concerning strategic decisions in relation to research management."

Prioritization of Travel and Tourism ( 6 indicators ) : The extent to which the government prioritizes the T & T sector has an important impact on T & T competitiveness .	The T&T Policy and Enabling Conditions subindex captures specific policies or strategic aspects that impact the T&T industry more directly and includes 4 pillars: 6. Prioritization of Travel and Tourism (6 indicators): The extent to which the government prioritizes the T&T sector has an important impact on T&T competitiveness. By making clear that the sector is of primary concern, the government can channel funds to essential development projects and coordinate the actors and resources necessary to develop the sector. Signalling the stability of government policy can affect the sector's ability to attract further private investment. The government can also play an important role in directly attracting tourists through national marketing campaigns. This pillar includes measures of government spending, effectiveness of marketing campaigns and country branding, and the completeness and timeliness of providing T&T data to international organizations, as this indicates the importance that a country assigns to its T&T sector. 7. International Openness (3 indicators): Developing a competitive T&T sector internationally requires a certain degree of openness and travel facilitation. Restrictive policies such as cumbersome visa requirements diminish tourists' willingness to visit a country, and indirectly reduce the availability of key services. Components measured in this pillar include the openness of the bilateral air service agreements which the government has entered, which impacts the availability of air connections to the country, and the number of regional trade agreements in force, which proxies the extent to which it is possible to provide world class tourism services. 8. Price Competitiveness (4 indicators): Lower costs related to travel in a country increase its attractiveness for many travellers as well as for investing in the T&T sector. Among the aspects of price competitiveness taken into account in this pillar are airfare ticket taxes and airport charges, which can make flight tickets much more expensive; the relative cost of hotel accommodation; the cost of living, proxied by purchasing power parity; and fuel price costs, which directly influence the cost of travel.

Different approaches and definitions of poverty can reveal not only different levels of poverty and different profiles of the poor (which has significant policy implications), but also different gender gaps in poverty. For example, in South Africa, an analysis of the 2008-2009 Living Conditions Survey showed larger gender disparities in poverty in the monetary approach than in the multidimensional approach.j Use of different dimensions, indicators and weights within the MPI approach may also lead to different profiles of the poor and gender gap in poverty.

Some technical schools offer two years of training after the Baccalaureat leading to the Brevet de Technicien Superieur (BTS) (for students ages 18 - 20). Access to vocational education at the basic education level (crafts and agriculture) is open to pupils in Forms 7 or 8 following a competitive examination. Pupils in Form 9 or in the first two years of secondary education may also opt for vocational training after passing a competitive examination. They are awarded a Certificate de Qualification Professionnelle at the end.

Additional efforts are necessary to continue reasonably high growth rates in the longer run. Polish enterprises have to be able to move to higher value-added ends of production chains in technology-intensive sectors. This can only be achieved through high levels of investment in R&D activities and other forms of innovation. These efforts can be effectively financed only by local savings. From a macroeconomic point of view, the high current account deficits recorded recently by Poland are not sustainable in the long run. At the microeconomic level, globalising Polish companies have to be actively encouraged by public policy to run their R&D and innovation activities in co-operation with local small and medium-sized companies and academic institutions.

This will include the ability to use digital technology to access and interpret information as it may be transformative in how farmers learn to interact optimally with markets and receive information , such as weather predictions , that impact their farming decisions ( Box 6.1 ) .	While most new jobs in the near future are expected to be generated outside agriculture, it currently occupies four out of five rural workers and close to half of the total labor force. Raising productivity in agriculture requires developing a rural workforce of better-educated farmers. Better-educated farmers are more likely to adopt modern farm inputs and technologies, make better use of purchased inputs and labor, choose technologies more effectively, and respond rapidly to changes in markets (Schultz 1988; Filmer et al. 2014). Improving the levels of basic educational attainment, through the development of reading, writing, and numeracy skills among the rural workforce, the efficacy of agricultural training can be significantly improved. And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture, the demand for schooling and more technical skills will rise. This will include the ability to use digital technology to access and interpret information as it may be transformative in how farmers learn to interact optimally with markets and receive information, such as weather predictions, that impact their farming decisions (Box 6.1).

Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations .	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.

However, distance learning poses a real challenge for equity. Learning mediated through edtech remains out of reach if electricity does not reach households, if families do not have computers or smartphones, or if internet access is not available (at appropriate bandwidth and speed) or is prohibitively expensive. Where limited access is available, boys are likely to be prioritised over girls. The digital gender divide means that there are multiple factors leading to gender-based digital exclusion. These include access-based challenges, affordability, lack of or lower levels of education, skills, and technological literacy, and inherent gender biases and socio-cultural norms (OECD, 2018). While smartphone use has grown rapidly, the GSMA found that in 2018 only 23% of sub-Saharan Africa's population used mobile internet regularly; as incomes are threatened, the cost of data may also become prohibitive (GSMA, 2019).

Standards , laws and effective enforcement mechanisms are necessary to ensure the accessibility of housing , public services and transport for persons with disabilities .	This section showed that there are many other best practices. Although lack of resources cannot justify inaction, financial constraints to implement physical and structural adaptation in cities are still a hurdle to increase accessibility. But there are low-cost options which could be scaled up. To make cities and communities inclusive and sustainable for persons with disabilities, more efforts are needed to: 1) Ensure that national policies and laws on accessible housing, public infrastructure, transport and services are in place and implemented. Standards, laws and effective enforcement mechanisms are necessary to ensure the accessibility of housing, public services and transport for persons with disabilities. Urban planning and development should include consultations with persons with disabilities and should include the needs of persons with disabilities, taking into account accessibility, affordability and quality of public spaces including transport, facilities, buildings and services, as well as cultural and recreational facilities and services. The ultimate aim of urban planning should be to provide an accessible environment where persons with disabilities can live independently. 2) Develop national policies and laws that guarantee access to adequate and affordable housing for persons with disabilities. Eliminate discriminatory laws that prevent persons with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, from exercising their right to adequate housing. Ensure that information relevant to housing is available in accessible formats and that available housing is affordable for persons with disabilities. 3) Raise awareness on disability among communities and decision makers and create the enabling environment where persons with disabilities are included without discrimination and can participate equally in their communities. 4) Share knowledge and best practices and build capacity. There is lack of expertise and technical capacity to implement measures promoting accessibility and inclusion. In order to increase the involvement and commitment of government departments, capacity-building is needed particularly among the government itself and building professionals, such as architects, engineers, urban planners and managers.

This begs the question : if jobs can migrate from one country to another , do policies to support job creation in one country become policies affecting jobs in other countries - - policies competing for jobs globally ?	There are also hidden losers. These are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries which have failed to develop new industries and services connected to world markets and the jobs that go with them.59 Workers in those countries, however, may not perceive the lost employment opportunities.60 One way to mitigate the welfare losses from globalization, both apparent and hidden, is through the international migration of workers. Income differentials across countries, which reflect differences in the growth rates of different economies, are important drivers of this migration. By reallocating workers from stagnant or slowly growing economies to rapidly growing ones, the international migration of workers contributes to the reduction in the QUESTION 7 Many developing countries face a jobs agenda. In some, it involves offering avenues to rural populations to move out of poverty. In others, it aims at leveraging the gains from urbanization and from integration in global markets. Yet in others, the goal is to prevent youth from becoming disenfranchised or to reduce the risk of conflict. These agendas are addressed through national policies that stimulate job creation by the private sector, especially in the areas and activities where development payoffs are highest. But jobs agendas of individual countries are connected through globalization: trade in goods and services, investment flows, and migration of workers. This begs the question: if jobs can migrate from one country to another, do policies to support job creation in one country become policies affecting jobs in other countries--policies competing for jobs globally? Among economists, the conventional wisdom is that the number of jobs is not determined by international trade and investment but by the total number of people in the labor force. And in general, openness to international trade and foreign direct investment is beneficial for all the countries involved. Thus, globalization is not a zero-sum game. From this point of view, policies to support job creation are not policies competing for jobs, even as they may alter the global flows of trade, investment, and workers.

Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State, as well as the regional and global community. When state structures become involved with and affected by violence and systemic corruption, drug trafficking can further weaken the efficacy of Governments to the point of creating ""failed State"" conditions at the national or subregional level. Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid. 28. One of the most recent challenges to the international drug control system is that posed by the use of the Internet for drug trafficking. States must do more to enable the investigation of such illegal operations in order to ensure that such operations are identified, restricted and eliminated and that the international postal system is not used for illicit drug shipments. Internet pharmacies and other dispensing methods that physically separate the prescriber or provider from the patient pose a particular risk and require the development of more effective regulatory approaches. In such systems of supply, it is more difficult for prescribers and dispensers to evaluate the needs of patients to ensure that the prescriptions will be used for legitimate medical purposes so as to protect the health and well-being of the individual. States should be mindful of the challenges that such methods for the supply of medications may pose."	ChaPTER i. ThE hEalTh aNd wElfaRE of maNkINd 5 27.

Urbanizing countries like Bangladesh have the potential to exploit several spillovers. But a key challenge for them is to find a way to move up the value-added chain and diversify manufacturing exports. Apart from ready-made garments, few sectors have grown substantially in Resource-rich countries Investments in extractive industries can represent a sizable fraction of a developing country's GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export revenue, but they do not create many jobs. The number of people at work during the construction phase may be sufficient to generate dynamism at the local level, but once the mines and fields are in operation, employment goes down dramatically. Perhaps the most extreme example is the liquid natural gas project in Papua New Guinea. The investment cost of the project exceeded twice the country's GDP at project startup, and the project may lead to double-digit growth rates for many years.

The experience in Thailand and the Philippines showed that active involvement of beneficiaries, through training and actual application, facilitated the promotion and commercialization of Peanut CRSP technologies.

Although they should be considered as an integral part of primary health care strategies and of the health system, CHW programmes are often fraught with challenges, including poor planning; unclear roles, education and career pathways; lack of certification hindering credibility and transferability; multiple competing actors with little coordination; fragmented, diseasespecific training; donor-driven management and funding; tenuous linkage with the health system; poor coordination, supervision, quality control and support; and lack of recognition of the contribution of CHWs (21).

The two most frequent terms used in this field are enterprise education and entrepreneurship education. The term enterprise education is primarily used in United Kingdom, and has been defined as focusing more broadly on personal development, mindset, skills and abilities, whereas the term entrepreneurship education has been defined to focus more on the specific context of setting up a venture and becoming self-employed (QAA, 2012, Mahieu, 2006). In United States, the only term used is entrepreneurship education (Erkkila, 2000). Some researchers use the longer term enterprise and entrepreneurship education (See for example Hannon, 2005), which is more clear but perhaps a bit unpractical. Sometimes enterprise and entrepreneurship education is discussed by using the term entrepreneurship education only, which however opens up for misunderstanding. Erkkila (2000) has proposed the unifying term entrepreneurial education as encompassing both enterprise and entrepreneurship education. This term will be used extensively in this report to avoid confusion. Further, the word ""student"" will in this report be used for learners on all levels of education, rather than adding the word ""pupil"" that some still use. For an overview of terms, see figure 1. 10. In Northern and Eastern Europe some additional terms are used. In Sweden and the Balkans the term entrepreneurial learning is often used as an equivalent to enterprise education (See for example Leffler and Falk-Lundqvist, 2013, Heder et al., 2011). This sometimes causes confusion, since it is the same term used in the research domain of entrepreneurial learning, which is about studying how entrepreneurs learn outside of the educational domain. Another set of terms used in Finland is internal entrepreneurship education and external entrepreneurship education (See for example Seikkula-Leino et al., 2010). Internal entrepreneurship education is a synonym to enterprise education, and external entrepreneurship education is a synonym to entrepreneurship education. Adding to the confusion here is the fact that internal entrepreneurship is sometimes used as a synonym to intrapreneurship, i.e. when acting entrepreneurially in an established organization (See for example Burgelman, 1983). 9 ."

Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs , many agribusinesses ( for example , millers , beer breweries , processors ) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas .	Nearby access to off-farm self-and wage employment in the rural economy and secondary towns is especially important for better and inclusive employment. Cross-country evidence from across the world shows convincingly that movements out of agriculture to the rural economy, secondary towns, and secondary cities (defined as less than 1 million inhabitants) are more poverty reducing than exits out of agriculture into the metropoles.48 While those who make it to the city, tend to gain much more on average than those who move nearby, only few of the poor manage to do so, and many more find their way into off-farm activities when they are nearby. The end outcome is one of an accelerated poverty reduction when people can find off-farm employment opportunities nearby. Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas. These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery), storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities. Even before accounting for related services agribusiness activities, including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing (ISIC 15) alone accounted for more than 30 percent of total formal employment and more than 20 percent of value added in formal firms (Figure5.5). Agribusiness also forms the only source of formal manufacturing jobs outside Abidjan. The past couple of years have witnessed a small increase in formal enterprise establishments outside Abidjan (Chapter5), though much room for expansion remains.	Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas.

However , the Earth 's biosphere does not serve a solely anthropogenic purpose ; the same land that supports human existence must also support the existence of other species .	Source and additional information: www.virtuelles-wasser.de www.waterfootprint.org Part 2 Ecological accounting We know that approximately 26 percent of the Earth's surface provides most of the materials and ecosystem services that humans demand, and that currently there are 2.1 global hectares of biocapacity available per person on the planet. However, the Earth's biosphere does not serve a solely anthropogenic purpose; the same land that supports human existence must also support the existence of other species. If society places a value on biodiversity, we must also reserve biologically productive land and resources for other, nondomesticated species. The Ecological Footprint does not measure biodiversity - it focuses only on the available supply of and demand for biocapacity by humans. But with the Footprint, we can quantify the pressure that humans put on the planet, and better address the root causes of biodiversity loss, including the pressure humans put on the habitat of plant and animal species. We have only one planet. Its capacity to support a thriving diversity of species, humans included, is large but fundamentally limited. When human demand on this capacity exceeds what is available - when we go into overshoot by surpassing ecological limits - we erode the health of the Earth's living systems for ourselves as well as for other species.

While law firms in Oman recently reported improvement in the response rate of agencies to IP complaints , the continued confusion about which agency is responsible for investigating different types of IP violations adds to the lack of efficiency in IPR enforcement .	Oman committed in the FTA to provide strong intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. Oman revised its IPR laws and regulations to implement its FTA commitments, adopted the GCC Trademark Law, and acceded to several international IPR treaties. While IPR laws in Oman are strong, the Omani system places a burden on right holders to perform their own monitoring and enforcement through legal actions in the courts. U.S. stakeholders have experienced difficulty getting the responsible government agencies to take enforcement action. While law firms in Oman recently reported improvement in the response rate of agencies to IP complaints, the continued confusion about which agency is responsible for investigating different types of IP violations adds to the lack of efficiency in IPR enforcement.

The concern is that the share of good jobs for development may decline in one country and increase in another .	There is merit to both views. Past the shortterm impact of outsourcing and delocalization, the total number of jobs in one country should not be substantially affected by policy decisions in other countries. Some firms may close or start activities, others may expand or contract their business, but total employment will be roughly determined by the size of the labor force. However, the composition of employment is bound to change. The concern is that the share of good jobs for development may decline in one country and increase in another. Whether that happens depends on the nature of good jobs for development and the types of national policies being adopted to support job creation. While the public's concern is legitimate, not all measures to support job creation amount to a beggar-thy-neighbor policy.

For business relationships entered into through correspondence or via the internet, banks must verify the identity of the contracting partner by obtaining a certified copy of an official identification document as well as a confirmation of the domicile indicated, either through correspondence exchange or by any other appropriate method. Identification based on an official identification document at delivery or receipt of mail is also deemed as sufficient proof of identity, provided that personal delivery to the recipient is thus warranted. In addition, beneficial ownership according to Form A must invariably be provided by individuals entering into a business relationship with a bank through correspondence.

As for skills , the contrast between high educational attainment and high unemployment rates is seen as an indication of a disconnect between the quality and relevance of schooling and the actual needs of the labor market .	A skills mismatch is the other common explanation. Close to 40 percent of the firms surveyed through investment climate assessments in the Middle East and North Africa report that the limited availability of skilled labor is a major constraint on business. Lack of formal schooling, which has increased substantially in the region, is not the cause. In fact, youth unemployment rates tend to rise with educational attainment in many countries. In Morocco, young people with a university education had an unemployment rate in 2009 of 17 percent, 3.7 times the rate for those with primary education or less. In Tunisia, 23 percent of university-educated youth were unemployed in 2010, compared with 11 percent for nongraduates.73 In Tunisia, it takes graduates 28 months on average to find a job, compared with 19 months for nongraduates.74 Not only has un- 208 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 ployment usually build on these two explanations. The poor flow of information between employers and jobseekers is seen as a justification for active labor market policies that focus on improving the match between labor supply and demand. Counseling can help jobseekers understand what they have to offer and where the opportunities are. Temporary employment programs may provide a first job and make employers realize the value of a young worker. As for skills, the contrast between high educational attainment and high unemployment rates is seen as an indication of a disconnect between the quality and relevance of schooling and the actual needs of the labor market. Improving youth employment prospects, it is argued, will critically depend on restructuring education and training systems to produce marketable skills rather than credentials.78 In the short term, training programs are indeed the most obvious response to provide unemployed youth with the practical skills employers need.

Whether or not a response to drug-related offences is proportionate depends in turn on how the legislative, judicial and executive arms of government respond in both law and practice. Given their limited resources, Governments should ensure that law enforcement and justice systems accord high priority to investigating, prosecuting and convicting the most violent of actors and those involved in the illicit supply chain, such as those who control, organize, manage or provide inputs, production and other services for drug trafficking organizations. 35.

A variety of social protection mechanisms exist that support people in their transition from one job to another. They concentrate on sustaining standards of living through unemployment benefits and public transfers. Learning new skills or relocating to where job opportunities are can also play a role. By moving from an adversely affected activity to another job, there is a gain in output that over time outweighs the cost of the support mechanisms.

"The issue of violence is a recurring theme in the latest dossiers. The importance of this issue reflects the tragic consequences of migration policies in particular contexts or crises, and the emergence of work around migrants' journeys. The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europe"" (33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cecile Canut and Anaik Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language approach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. This perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting sociospatial inequalities in the era of globalization."

While technologies to steeply reduce emissions are available today, there is not only tremendous inertia in the energy system, but also much room for further cost declines in the technology. These considerations lend themselves to a long-term, dynamic perspective that accounts for how spending on new technologies today may lower the cost of reducing emissions in the future.

The past couple of years have witnessed a small increase in formal enterprise establishments outside Abidjan ( Chapter5 ) , though much room for expansion remains .	Nearby access to off-farm self-and wage employment in the rural economy and secondary towns is especially important for better and inclusive employment. Cross-country evidence from across the world shows convincingly that movements out of agriculture to the rural economy, secondary towns, and secondary cities (defined as less than 1 million inhabitants) are more poverty reducing than exits out of agriculture into the metropoles.48 While those who make it to the city, tend to gain much more on average than those who move nearby, only few of the poor manage to do so, and many more find their way into off-farm activities when they are nearby. The end outcome is one of an accelerated poverty reduction when people can find off-farm employment opportunities nearby. Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas. These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery), storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities. Even before accounting for related services agribusiness activities, including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing (ISIC 15) alone accounted for more than 30 percent of total formal employment and more than 20 percent of value added in formal firms (Figure5.5). Agribusiness also forms the only source of formal manufacturing jobs outside Abidjan.

Practice Although there is limited availability of data within the nursing profession across South America, authorized practice seems to vary depending on nurse type. In Argentina, nurses and licensed nurses both have prescriptive authority and may prescribe any medications. However, neither may refer patients for additional care, nor may they diagnose patients. In Peru, a nurse has a duty to administer healthcare in an emergent situation and, because of this, nurse specialists and general nurses may prescribe medication or refer patients for additional medical care. Both nurse types may diagnose patients. Ancestral midwives in Ecuador may refer patients for additional medical care, diagnose patients, and prescribe medicinal plants and natural remedies. In Brazil, nurses and advanced or specialized nurses possess authority to offer a nursing diagnosis. In addition, these types of nurses may prescribe medications according to protocols, clinical and therapeutic guidelines, or other technical regulations established by the federal, state, or municipal authorities. These protocols and guidelines are subject to the legal provisions of the profession. Prescriptive authority granted to nurses and advanced or specialized nurses is regarding medications previously established in each respective public health program and those routinely approved by each health institution. Nurses and advanced or specialized nurses, however, do not have the autonomy to request examinations and prescribe medications in isolated private practices.

First, with approximately two-thirds of Coted'Ivoire's poor living in rural areas and almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, modernizing and raising labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and inclusive employment generation in Coted'Ivoire. Second, expanding productive employment opportunities offthe farm will be equally important. Off-farm employment generation will be more inclusive and poverty reducing when it happens nearby. The poor are concentrated in the rural economies and secondary towns, drawing attention to the challenge of Coted'Ivoire's high rate of urban concentration and its corresponding low rate of rural off-farm wage employment. Expanding productive employment opportunities offthe farm will require not only accelerating jobs creation in formal firms, but also putting in place policies to raise productivity in nonagricultural self-employment in the informal sector, while expansion of the formal sector continues. Finally, the occupational transformation typically lags the economic transformation, and social protection will be needed for those unable to seize opportunities and access more productive employment opportunities. An in-depth discussion of social protection policies falls beyond the scope of the report, though it remains a key part of a comprehensive approach to the jobs issue.	Expanding productive employment opportunities offthe farm will require not only accelerating jobs creation in formal firms, but also putting in place policies to raise productivity in nonagricultural self-employment in the informal sector, while expansion of the formal sector continues.

Feed the soil and let the soil feed the plants. Organic certification serves a certain function but is not a true proxy for environmental outcomes. We need to align intention and incentives to actively support farmers adopt practices that will restore soil health and there needs to be a financial mechanism that meets this need. Organic premium again is based on production. Models like carbon insetting helps companies to invest in practices that reduce carbon emissions within their supply chain while supporting farmers to adopt carbon farming practices.

Particular attention is paid to soil and water management at the farm and water-basin levels and preservation of the natural resource base , that is , maintenance of soil fertility and avoidance of salinity buildup .	Given the need to improve the resource-use efficiency in irrigated lowland environments and the success of the Sahel cultivars and integrated crop management (ICM), WARDA implements its research strategy for this environment along the following three lines: * Breeding. In the irrigated lowland environments, breeding uses the enlarged gene pool provided by inter-and intraspecific cultivars. Breeding activities focus on developing high-yielding shortduration cultivars with good grain quality and resistance to major African stresses. Emphasis is being placed on developing varieties that are competitive with weeds in direct-seeded systems. * Further development and extrapolation of ICM practices. ICM decision-support systems developed for the Sahel are being evaluated and disseminated to other areas, in particular to irrigation schemes in northern Nigeria. ICM is being adapted for the medium-input irrigation systems in the International rice research and development 53 (sub-)humid agroecological zones. Potential spillover to the low-to mediuminput rainfed lowland systems is given particular attention. * Identification of INRM practices. To ensure the success of ICM, sound natural resource management practices need to be developed. Particular attention is paid to soil and water management at the farm and water-basin levels and preservation of the natural resource base, that is, maintenance of soil fertility and avoidance of salinity buildup.

A structure of eight years of general basic education followed by four years of secondary education had been introduced for a few years during the educational reform of 1975 .	Country Notes Primary education lasts for six years and is compulsory. However the draft Constitution recommends that there be nine years of compulsory education. Admission to secondary education is, at present, based on an intra-school examination not a national Baccaluria. Secondary education covers six years divided into two three-year cycles: grades 7 to 9 in middle school (Maktabeh Motevaseteh) and grades 10 to 12 at high school (Doreyeh Aali). At the end of the first cycle, pupils sit for an examination. At the end of the second cycle, they sit for intra-school examinations. Technical secondary education is offered in the lower and upper secondary cycle at middle schools in such subjects as Commerce, Applied Arts, Teacher Training, Agriculture and Civil Aviation. Courses lead to a Baccaluria equivalent level qualification.

The continued concentration of employment in agribusiness activities , including in agriculture and food processing , implies that these sectors will remain important engines for job creation in the foreseeable future .	However, as the economy just started recovering during the period covered by the available firm panel census, and since the numbers of firms and formal jobs are low to start with, there is still limited evidence of structural changes. Based on Centrale des Bilans data, the formal sector went from employing approximately 200,000 individuals in 2003 to approximately 300,000 individuals in 2012. At the same time, formal jobs creation has been small in the aggregate: the highest number of formal jobs created in a year is only approximately 40,000 (Figure9). Since there are more than 10 million employed individuals in the country, this means there is limited potential for the formal sector to absorb a large amount of labor in the short term. As discussions in Chapter3 also highlight, it will take a sustained period of fast growth in the industry and service sectors for the share of formal wage employment in the economy to substantially increase. In addition, despite signs of regional diversification, over 90 percent of firms and jobs are still concentrated in Abidjan, creating challenges related to the inclusiveness of formal jobs. In terms of output, new sectors such as oil and gas have become the most important contributor to value added but their contribution to employment is negligible. The continued concentration of employment in agribusiness activities, including in agriculture and food processing, implies that these sectors will remain important engines for job creation in the foreseeable future.

Local institutions and structures provide additional structures , networks , and relationships with which to reach the population , and important resources which can be critical in implementing key policies - such as quarantine and ensuring that those in quarantine have access to food .	As the COVID-19 crisis disproportionately affects women and girls (see Section 5.2 on GESI), the response needs to be gendered and women and girls should participate in the decisions that affect them, as is their right. Although women are on the frontlines of the crisis in their homes, communities, and healthcare facilities, they are often excluded from national and community decision-making processes and governance structures that determine the response. Research finds that women leaders have been more successful in reducing transmission than their male counterparts (Social Europe, 2020) yet female leadership is low globally. We do not have full information for the Maintains countries, but in Kenya there are six women in the 21-person NERC on Coronavirus (29%), in Pakistan there is one woman in the 13-person Emergency Core Committee (8%), and in Uganda an analysis of four districtlevel COVID-19 task forces found that women made up 22.5% of members on average, and that men held the most influential positions. This low level of representation means that these committees are less likely to consider women's and men's different experiences when shaping responses which is expected to deepen gender inequality. (c) Maintains 33 Close and effective coordination at national, provincial, district, and local levels While clear direction, policy choices, and central management of the crisis are paramount, delivery can only occur at local level. Local institutions and structures provide additional structures, networks, and relationships with which to reach the population, and important resources which can be critical in implementing key policies - such as quarantine and ensuring that those in quarantine have access to food. It is essential that they are closely connected to, coordinated by, and supported by national technical teams. In addition to this, local structures need to take account of local specificities and contexts; they play an important role in translating and adapting national policies into locally palatable and effective measures and represent a crucial connective resource especially in countries with multiple ethnicities and local languages.

There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease .	Health worker migration in response to the global shortage of health professionals demands dedicated and effective management, including building the capacity of health systems in origin countries, promotion of good practices and prevention of negative effects of health worker migration. There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.

For example , light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women , with significant impacts on poverty .	Data and analysis can be used to identify misaligned incentives, indicated by a gap between the individual and the social value of jobs. Several research areas deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can measure the tax burden that applies to capital and labor and assess the crosssubsidization between individuals or firms. The methods of labor economics can uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings, or between the social and individual returns to schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on reducing poverty. Productivity studies allow for quantifying the spillovers from employment in foreign-owned investment companies, or in cities. Environmental studies shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs. And valA simple approach to setting policy priorities follows five steps (figure 19): * Step one: What are good jobs for development? Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities. The nature of those jobs varies with the characteristics of the country, including its phase of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges are not the same in agrarian economies, resource-rich countries, conflict-affected countries, or in countries with high youth unemployment. And the jobs with the greatest development impact differ as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. * Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under way, the development value of new manufacturing jobs might materialize. But it might not if, for example, inadequate urbanization policies limit the establishment of new firms.

Some of them have drawn their inspiration from India's Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA), which was created 40 years ago.

Women's reproductive years are bordered by puberty (and the onset of menstruation) and menopause, roughly covering ages 15 to 49. Globally, women's health status during this period is dominated by issues related to sexual and reproductive health. The leading female causes of death at the global level and in developing regions are HIV/ AIDS and maternal conditions. In 2012, in developing regions, the female mortality rates for these two causes of death were 34 and 19 deaths per 100,000 female population aged 15 to 49 years, respectively (table 2.3). In developed regions, maternal conditions were not a leading cause of death (1 per 100,000 death rate), while HIV/AIDS was among the highest ranked causes of death (6 per 100,000), together with breast cancer, ischaemic heart disease and self-harm.

This scheme replaces one which was based on the English pattern culminating in A levels and a three-year first degree course. The introduction of the 8-4-4 education system has led to tremendous changes in the secondary school curriculum. This is in line with the need for a broad-based curriculum that prepares students for self-reliance, vocational training and further education. In 1990, the first KCSE students entered university to begin four years of study for a general degree. The KCSE is administered by the Kenya National Examinations Council.

The rural-urban shift generally improves individual well-being, especially for those who find wage employment. Still, workers' share of global income may be declining, a pattern attributed in part to globalization and technological change. Wages for the same occupation are converging across countries, but a higher premium is paid for more skilled occupations. Women's earnings still lag behind those of men, and the fraction of them who work varies enormously across countries.

Third, income generation in agriculture is more poverty reducing. Cross-country evidence has convincingly shown that GDP growth in agriculture is more poverty reducing than GDP growth originating outside agriculture.32 This holds especially when it concerns extreme poverty, when most of the poor live in rural areas, earning their living in agriculture,33 and when land is more equally distributed, such that poor smallholders can put both their assets (labor and land) to work, benefit from them directly, and do so in large numbers. These cross-country empirical regularities are confirmed in Asia (for example, China)34 as well as in recent African case studies. For instance, two-thirds of the 4 percentage point reduction in the poverty headcount during 2005-2009 in Uganda could be accounted for by the increase in earnings among individuals who were working primarily in agriculture in 2005 and continued doing so through 2009.35 This followed because a large share of the population stayed in agriculture (49 percent) and many of them were poor, such that even a small drop in their poverty rate corresponded to a large number of people exiting poverty. The bulk of the sharp drop in poverty in Ethiopia during 1996-2011 could similarly be ascribed to growth in the agricultural sector.36 Yet, income generation in agriculture does not always or automatically lead to poverty reduction. In Brazil, for example, growth in agriculture did not contribute much to poverty reduction.37 Land in Brazil is unequally distributed, and its agricultural boom of the past two decades has largely been driven by large-scale, highly mechanized, skill-intensive agriculture (much of it following the development of the Cerrado for soybean exports to China). It highlights that the job-generating and poverty-reducing powers of agriculture are further conditioned by initial conditions (agro-ecological potential and land distribution), production modalities (large versus small scale) and agricultural policies.

Although Doing Business collects and publishes data on the time and cost for domestic transport, it does not use these data in calculating the score for trading across borders or the ranking on the ease of trading across borders. The main reason for this is that the time and cost for domestic transport are affected by many external factors--such as the geography and topography of the transit territory, road capacity and general infrastructure, proximity to the nearest port or border, and the location of warehouses where the traded goods are stored--and so are not directly influenced by an economy's trade policies and reforms.

ANDACCELERATINGPOVERTYREDUCTION With two-thirds of Coted'Ivoire's poor living in rural areas according to recent (2011) estimates and almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, raising labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and more inclusive employment generation in Coted'Ivoire. This also plays to its potential comparative advantage in cash crop production and takes advantage of the rising demand for high-value and processed agricultural produce following rising incomes and dietary diversification, especially among its large urban population. For the country to grasp these opportunities, agricultural labor productivity will need to be made competitive with off-farm opportunities in the cities. Otherwise the exit of youth out of agriculture, some degree of which is normal, will only accelerate. Modernizing agriculture is therefore thefirst prong to more, better, and more inclusive employment. It will be the topic of Chapter3.

This became a rallying cry for challenging victim blaming and holding offenders to account. The year also saw the women's and feminist movements mobilizing thousands - including during January's Women's Marches across Europe, and Black Monday protests in Poland that successfully pushed the government not to further restrict access to safe and legal abortion. Yet, throughout Europe and Central Asia, women and girls continued to experience systemic human rights violations and abuses, including torture and other ill-treatment, denial of the right to health and bodily autonomy, inequality of opportunity, and widespread gender-based violence. Access to abortion remained criminalized in most circumstances in Ireland and Northern Ireland and severely restricted in practice. In Poland, there were systemic barriers in accessing safe and legal abortion. Abortion remained criminalized in all circumstances in Malta. The EU and Moldova signed the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention). It was ratified by Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Norway and Switzerland - bringing to 28 the number of states to have done so. Ukraine signed it in 2011 but failed to ratify the Convention. Despite increasingly strong legislative protections, gender-based violence against women remained pervasive, including in Albania, Croatia and Romania. In Russia, under the cover of the so-called ""traditional values"" narrative, and encountering little public criticism, the Parliament adopted legislationdecriminalizing some forms of domestic violence whichPresident Putin signed into law. In Norway and Sweden, gender-based violence, including sexual violence, remained a serious problem with inadequate state response."

Rethinking international migration, internal migration, mobility and urbanization That migration is the most problematic of the population variables is taken as given. Unlike the unique events of birth and death that define an individual's lifetime, migration can be a multiple event. Its measurement depends entirely upon how it is defined in time and across space. ... Despite all the problems inherent in the collection of migration data, significant progress has been achieved over recent years. The compilation of a world origin-destination database, developed originally at the University of Sussex and now much extended and maintained by the United Nations Population Division and the World Bank, has provided the framework for a more precise measurement of global international population movement.a These data showed that about 3 per cent of the world's population lived in a State or territory not of their birth and that that proportion had not changed significantly since the 1990s ... As the systems of internal and international migration evolve and change, so too, does the nature of the linkages between them ... other forms of short-term mobility emerge from essentially urban cultures and economies. ... The idea that most people do not move or are fixed at a specific location might be appealing but it is wrong. Mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility. Nevertheless, some peoples appear to move more than others and in different ways from others, which appears to be closely linked with the level of development in each country, which, in turn, is linked with the distribution of the population in each country. Despite all the difficulties with the measurement of internal migration as sketched above, considerable progress has been made towards the construction of analytical models that allow the comparison of patterns across space.

Such training provides an opportunity for customs agencies to emphasize the importance of integrity at work, deliver anti-corruption messages and promote the agency's code of conduct.14 Customs employees should meet the educational requirements defined by customs authorities to qualify for and effectively perform the role of clearance official. For their part, governments should take advantage of training programs offered by international organizations--both for newly recruited employees as well as for experienced customs officers and executives.15 The future orientation of customs will require a transition toward a knowledge-based model.16 Greater investment in the education and skills development of clearance officials is important. The World Bank Group's Customs Modernization Handbook 2005--which emphasized human resources management--identified the education and training of staff as the most important factor affecting customs performance, a view that has been reiterated by several recent studies.17 Education also improves the transferability of skills18 and is key to building technology absorption capacity.19 Providing regular training to customs clearance officials is positively related to customs efficiency. Doing Business data indicate that the average time required to clear customs (for both exports and imports) is about 34% lower in economies where clearance officers receive regular training compared to those where no regular training is provided Source: Doing Business database.

As lifetime experience is affected by years exposed to violence, looking at experience in the past 12 months reveals that recent experience of violence declines with age also. Prevalence of violence in the past 12 months was 16 per cent for women aged between 16 and 24 years and less than 1 per cent for women aged between 65 and 70 years.a Many surveys conducted in developing countries do not include older women in their sample. However, results from the few that do show that the experience of violence tends to decline as women age. In Fiji,b results show that younger women are much more at risk of experiencing intimate partner violence in the previous 12 months than older women. In that country, the prevalence of intimate partner violence of a physical nature in the past 12 months declined from 40 per cent in the 18-to 24-year-old age group to 3 per cent in the 55-to 64-year-old age group. A similar pattern was observed for intimate partner sexual violence. In Morocco, the experience of intimate partner physical violence in the past 12 months peaked between the ages of 30 and 34 and then declined, with prevalence halving from 6 per cent in the 40-to 49-year-old age group to 3 per cent in the 50-to 64-year-old age group.c Source: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Violence against Women: An EUwide Survey, 2014.

ROCARIZ is a successor network to the highly successful WARDA/NARS Rice Task Force Collaborative Mechanism for rice research and development within the subregion, which was supported financially by USAID in 1991-97. ROCARIZ maintains the task force structure with seven functional task forces on mangrove swamps, rice breeding, Sahel resource management, integrated pest management, natural resource management, rice economics, and technology transfer. ROCARIZ finances small two-year research projects through national scientists in member countries. The technology transfer task force includes the active participation of researchers, extension officers, and end-users of research results. ROCARIZ has established a forum--the Biennial Regional Rice Research Review (4Rs)--for reporting and publishing rice research and development activities within the subregion. The principal stakeholders of ROCARIZ are WARDA, CORAF member countries, national research systems, USAID, the private sector, and rice farmers. ROCARIZ values its guiding principles of trust, mutual respect, and joint ownership--essential ingredients for a successful partnership program. ROCARIZ is coordinated at WARDA headquarters and is managed by a coordinator under the guidance of a steering committee composed of national scientists, the private sector, development agents, and a WARDA representative.

The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country. We measure the level of tourism service infrastructure through the number of hotel rooms complemented by the extent of access to services such as car rentals and ATMs.	Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries.

Coted'ivoire? A benchmark scenario to gauge expected movement between employment sectors. The sections above provide a conceptual framework to consider the potential for agriculture and other sectors to generate employment and raise earnings for the poorer segments of society. This section presents a benchmark scenario outlining how much movement between sectors can realistically be expected in Coted'Ivoire over the 2015-2025 horizon. It starts from the employment situation in Coted'Ivoire in February 2014 and applies projections of population growth and growth rates for the main sectors of the economy over the next decade, as well as international historical estimates of the sectoral elasticity of employment in Africa and around the world. The projections forecast the composition of job growth over the next decade as well as the resulting effects on the country-wide employment structure. They provide a benchmark to consider how changes in productivity in agriculture or in other sectors, or changes in the composition of GDP growth, can influence the overall employment composition (holding sectoral elasticities of employment constant). The benchmark scenario is optimistic as it assumes high growth in industry (secondary), commerce, and services in the next decade, with more limited growth in agriculture (Table 2.3) (see AnnexB for more background on methodology and findings).49 48 Christiaensen, De Weerdt, and Todo (2013); Christiaensen and Todo (2014). 49 This scenario is also based on growth-employment elasticities from low-income countries. Projections suggest a continuing decline of the agricultural labor share, mostly counterbalanced by an increase in nonagricultural self-employment, which is expected to become the main source of employment (Figure2.12). Specifically, it is expected that the share of employment in agriculture could decrease from 51 percent in 2014 to 29 percent in 2025. In parallel, it is likely that nonagricultural selfemployment will become the main source of employment by 2025, 43 percent of the labor force is expected to be self-employed outside agriculture. The share of wage employment also increases, but it will remain the least prevalent type of employment, with less than 30 percent of the labor force.

Summary of Country Gender Profile in Cote d'Ivoire (2013) General Situation of Women  Following the end of the long political crisis in 2011, Cote d'Ivoire is making efforts toward to restoration. However, because of long turmoil of the crisis, statistical data is insufficient, and the development of statistics and a population registration system are pressing issues.  In Cote d'Ivoire, there are various ethnic groups, each with a different language, culture and customs. The social status of women varies in each ethnic group. Generally, the social and economic status of women is low, and they have inadequate access to basic social services and less economic power compared to men. Government Policy  The government of Cote d'Ivoire has adopted policies and action plans to promote gender equality. It is important to assure the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these actions.  The strategy for the fight against gender based violence (GBV) was established in 2012, and it is now in the implementation phase of the action plan.  A project to develop a database of talented women is ongoing under the initiative of the Presidential Office as a way to evaluate and utilize the capacities and talents of women across the country. National Machinery  In 1976, the Ministry for Condition of Woman (Ministere de la Condition de la Femme) was established. Since then, the ministry has been in charge of promoting gender equality. However, the budget has not been sufficiently allocated. Therefore, the allocation of an adequate budget and the establishment of administrative capacity are required.  Gender Groups have not been established in all ministries. Sufficient budget allocation and human resources are challenges for the Gender Groups.

We undertake this analysis using qualitative interviews and household survey data from two districts in the Mahanadi Delta , Odisha , India .	"Developing country deltas are important food producing areas and are home to large numbers of subsistence farmers. In particular, rice farmers dominate the populous deltas of South and Southeast Asia and face frequent climate hazards that have shortand long-term impacts on rice production and livelihoods. The aim of this study is to identify and explain proximal and ultimate factors (land access, cultural practices, and institutional support) that affect rice farmer resilience, that is, to explain why some farmers are more sensitive to climate shocks, why some farmers suffer long-term impacts from climate shocks, and what underlying ""ultimate"" factors reproduce this vulnerability over time. We undertake this analysis using qualitative interviews and household survey data from two districts in the Mahanadi Delta, Odisha, India. We show that climate hazards cause rice production shocks that are problematic for farmers because rice is predominantly used for household consumption in a context of unreliable off-farm income sources and a lack of insurance and credit. Our research emphasizes that ""ultimate"" drivers interact with the current mode of rice cultivation to reproduce a low resilience farming state. We argue that agricultural development interventions seeking to make rice farming more resilient to climate hazards should focus on boosting productivity and shock-resistance, but also be cognizant of the system within which rice farming is practiced and the contextual ""ultimate"" factors that reproduce vulnerability."

Finally, it bears repeating that serious protection challenges remain, challenges that are likely to persist unless concerted steps are taken to counter some worrying trends. Among them, most critical perhaps, is the persistent evidence of violence targeting migrant communities including young migrants, whether in the course of their journeys or on arrival in their new host countries. Children who have survived the challenges of life in refugee camps or perilous border crossings need inclusive measures, stability and opportunity if they are to overcome the searing legacy of the past.

For those child migrants who have travelled alone, more may be necessary to ensure resilience, to ensure that their voices are heard, and to support their prospects of success. Child welfare and migration governance systems need to converge and build the capacity to collaborate with greater consistency, to facilitate the inclusion of migrant children into domestic child protection structures, to incentivize greater knowledge of and understanding towards children's needs and rights in the migration system, and to thoroughly implement non-discrimination obligations in respect of all migrant children within the jurisdictions.

International banking specialists are generally well informed about export matters, even in areas that fall outside the usual limits of international banking.

In particular , rice farmers dominate the populous deltas of South and Southeast Asia and face frequent climate hazards that have shortand long-term impacts on rice production and livelihoods .	"Developing country deltas are important food producing areas and are home to large numbers of subsistence farmers. In particular, rice farmers dominate the populous deltas of South and Southeast Asia and face frequent climate hazards that have shortand long-term impacts on rice production and livelihoods. The aim of this study is to identify and explain proximal and ultimate factors (land access, cultural practices, and institutional support) that affect rice farmer resilience, that is, to explain why some farmers are more sensitive to climate shocks, why some farmers suffer long-term impacts from climate shocks, and what underlying ""ultimate"" factors reproduce this vulnerability over time. We undertake this analysis using qualitative interviews and household survey data from two districts in the Mahanadi Delta, Odisha, India. We show that climate hazards cause rice production shocks that are problematic for farmers because rice is predominantly used for household consumption in a context of unreliable off-farm income sources and a lack of insurance and credit. Our research emphasizes that ""ultimate"" drivers interact with the current mode of rice cultivation to reproduce a low resilience farming state. We argue that agricultural development interventions seeking to make rice farming more resilient to climate hazards should focus on boosting productivity and shock-resistance, but also be cognizant of the system within which rice farming is practiced and the contextual ""ultimate"" factors that reproduce vulnerability."

In summary, our quantitative analysis shows that migration as a topic is receiving increasing attention: the growing number of publications and citations are a sign of heightened interest, at least within the academic community. Measures of views/downloads and Altmetrics suggest that there is room for improving the reach and readership of scholarly production on migration. One of the main obstacles to this is the fact that academic publications tend to be behind paywalls, significantly limiting access to material beyond academia. Journal subscribers, for example, are often academic institutions, and the cost of downloading single articles 43 IOM, 2017e. 146 Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions for non-subscribers can be prohibitive. Open access for academic publications enables free downloads, but usually requires publisher fees to be paid by the author or their institution. More open-access journals (such as Comparative Migration Studies and Anti-Trafficking Review) have, however, been publishing on migration.44 In addition, academic language and writing style tend to be more technical than in other areas of publishing, and the topics tend to be narrower. Dissemination of findings, however, through both traditional and newer forms of media, offer opportunities for academic research on migration to inform public and policy discourses.

Similarly, the availability of safe and effective assistive products is limited in terms of quantity, as well as in terms of the range of types, models and sizes of the products. Lack of physical and cognitive accessibility of the transport system and the facilities where services are provided raise additional barriers. Another common barrier to assistive technology provisioning is the lack of properly trained personnel, skilled in manufacturing or adapting products, or delivering services. Finally, high costs for assistive products and services and traveling costs constitute major barriers. Taxes and duties on assistive products, or materials and components for their production, add to the costs.

ISSN 2040-8188 ISBN 978-1-907194-45-0 The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a new survey-based index designed to measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. The WEAI was initially developed as a tool to reflect women's empowerment that may result from the United States government's Feed the Future Initiative, which commissioned the development of the WEAI. The WEAI can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time. The WEAI is an aggregate index, reported at the country or regional level, based on individual-level data collected by interviewing men and women within the same households. The WEAI comprises two subindexes. The first assesses the degree to which women are empowered in five domains of empowerment (5DE) in agriculture. It reflects the percentage of women who are empowered and, among those who are not, the percentage of domains in which women enjoy adequate achievements. These domains are (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decisionmaking power about productive resources, (3) control of use of income, (4) leadership in the community, and (5) time allocation. The second subindex (the Gender Parity Index [GPI]) measures gender parity. The GPI reflects the percentage of women who are empowered or whose achievements are at least as high as the men in their households. For those households that have not achieved gender parity, the GPI shows the empowerment gap that needs to be closed for women to reach the same level of empowerment as men. This technical paper documents the development of the WEAI and presents pilot data from Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda, so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings.

Global employment in manufacturing increased by only 30 percent from 1990 to 2008 , with most of the expansion taking place in Asia , especially in China .	"The East Asian trends are consistent with the ""flying geese"" pattern of development, where economic transformation is consistent with dynamic changes in comparative advantage. Industrialization in East Asian countries began with the development of labor-intensive sectors, gradually shifted to capital-intensive sectors, and then to knowledge-intensive activities. In parallel, wages rose and skills increased.35 First Japan, then Korea, and more recently China followed a similar pattern. As labor costs increase further, light manufacturing jobs are likely to migrate away from coastal China, where most industries have concentrated. By some estimates, nearly 100 million jobs are at stake.36 The migration of light manufacturing jobs out of coastal China could open a once-in-ageneration opportunity for countries in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia to jump-start their industrialization. But some observers predict that the migration will go mainly to the inland areas in China, where wage rates are lower than on the coast. This would be consistent with the patterns of industrialization in Japan; Korea; Taiwan, China; and the United States, where the initial geographical concentration of industries was followed by dispersion within the same country.37 However, China's labor market is relatively integrated to the point where even unskilled wage rates in rural areas have been increasing rapidly.38 Therefore, an overall decline in the manufacturing share of GDP in China might be unavoidable, opening up the opportunity for labor-intensive industrialization in other developing countries.39 The rapid growth of labor productivity in manufacturing is resulting in the stagnation or even the decline of the number of manufacturing jobs worldwide (figure 7.2). Global employment in manufacturing increased by only 30 percent from 1990 to 2008, with most of the expansion taking place in Asia, especially in China.

Access to affordable and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite for firms to operate. Power shortages are the number-two constraint to firm growth and job creation mentioned by entrepreneurs the world over--and number one in low-income countries. Telecommunications allow for a better flow of information with suppliers and customers, and the internet and mobile technology facilitate the spread of new ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets, as do ports and airports.79 The way infrastructure is regulated is important as well. Inadequate pricing policies and regulations amplify the gap in needed infrastructure services. In many countries, monopolies based on political connections have led to reduced quantities of infrastructure services at higher prices and lower quality.80 Business regulation also affects the opportunities for businesses to grow and create jobs. Regulations can increase the cost of doing business, in money or in time needed to comply. Steps taken to meet requirements or to pay fees are a burden for businesses, as are delays or discretionary decisions, such as those for permits or licenses.

A pattern emerges whereby there was unequal access to agricultural extension , which worked against the small-scale cultivators .	"The nature of agricultural extension meant many small-scale farmers were excluded from knowledge and skill transfers. Only 13% of households have attended training or demonstrations. It was reported that training and demonstrations were attended by, ""or for,"" larger farmers. A small-scale rice farmer noted that training took place ""yesterday"" but only farmers ""with more land"" go (SSI:27). This reflects the agricultural department policy of strategically targeting a handful of progressive farmers in each panchayat. A pattern emerges whereby there was unequal access to agricultural extension, which worked against the small-scale cultivators. Thus, small-scale farmers relied on rice cropping with low yields, neither accruing resources to cope with shocks or external knowledge to adapt or enhance cultivation practices."

Child migration is not a new phenomenon, but one that has a history dating back to ancient times. Children, both boys and girls, have always migrated with or following their families, to pursue opportunities or increase their safety away from home. Much of this migration is unproblematic. After a period of adjustment to a new context, and with the exception of situations where enduring racial or religious discrimination prevents this, most children, along with their families, integrate into their new societies. This chapter, however, focuses on child migration that does not conform to that pattern - migration that is unsafe, irregular, exploitative. And it focuses on international migration. This is not to suggest that other aspects related to child migration are not important. However, the urgent need to better understand unsafe international child migration, in its various dimensions, stems from the fact that this aspect of child migration requires greater engagement and support from governments and international actors, to ensure children the protection they are entitled to.

In settings characterized by high mortality and weak health systems , trained traditional birth attendants can contribute to reducing mortality through participation in key evidence-based interventions ( 32 ) .	Almost all of the intervention studies involving CHWs showed a significant impact on reducing maternal mortality and on improving perinatal and postpartum service utilization indicators (26). Communitybased intervention packages, which almost always involved CHWs, may have a possible effect on reducing maternal mortality, although the pooled result just crossed the line of no effect (24). Women's groups (facilitated by CHWs) practising participatory learning and action, compared with usual care, have a positive impact on reducing maternal mortality in low-resource settings (31). In settings characterized by high mortality and weak health systems, trained traditional birth attendants can contribute to reducing mortality through participation in key evidence-based interventions (32). There is some evidence of moderate quality that CHWs are effective in providing psychosocial support (15). CHWs were effective in delivering psychosocial and educational interventions to reduce maternal depression (35). Non-specialist providers (a classification that includes CHWs) may be effective in reducing perinatal depression (36).

These programs address technology generation and dissemination , from upstream strategic research targeting specific constraints to the application and integration of different technology components in farmers ' fields .	Implementing WARDA's research strategy comprises four essential elements: * Technology generation for sustainable development * Technology dissemination and farmer empowerment * Policy research * Capacity building and training of key agents of change WARDA's rainfed and irrigated area programs result in improved technologies for the respective environments. These programs address technology generation and dissemination, from upstream strategic research targeting specific constraints to the application and integration of different technology components in farmers' fields. WARDA's Rice Policy and Development Program addresses the overall environment in which the proposed technology will be disseminated and used, from the farm level up, including higher aggregation levels such as watersheds, markets, agroecological zones, nations, and regions. This program thereby focuses on problems that cut across ecosystems, particularly with respect to policy research and scaling-up technology dissemination. The fourth principal element, capacity building and training, is not specifically linked to any particular program. Instead, it is integrated into each program under the coordination of a training unit.

These raw materials are key inputs in important U.S. manufacturing industries , including the aerospace , automotive , construction , and electronics industries .	China continues to deploy a combination of export restraints, including export quotas, export licensing, minimum export prices, export duties and other restrictions, on a number of raw material inputs where it holds the leverage of being among the world's leading producers. Through these export restraints, it appears that China is able to provide substantial economic advantages to a wide range of downstream producers in China at the expense of foreign downstream producers, while creating pressure on foreign downstream producers to move their operations, technologies and jobs to China. In 2013, China removed its export quotas and duties on several raw material inputs of key interest to the U.S. steel, aluminum, and chemicals industries after the United States won a dispute settlement case against China at the WTO. In 2014, the United States won a second WTO case, focusing on China's export restraints on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum, which are key inputs for a multitude of U.S.-made products, including hybrid automobile batteries, wind turbines, energy-efficient lighting, steel, advanced electronics, automobiles, petroleum, and chemicals. China removed those export restraints in May 2015. In July 2016, the United States launched a third WTO case challenging export restraints maintained by China. The challenged export restraints include export quotas and export duties maintained by China on various forms of 11 raw materials, including antimony, chromium, cobalt, copper, graphite, indium, lead, magnesia, talc, tantalum, and tin. These raw materials are key inputs in important U.S. manufacturing industries, including the aerospace, automotive, construction, and electronics industries. China appears to have removed the challenged export restraints, as the United States continues to monitor the situation.

Sociological and anthropological methods can provide texture and context missing in quantitative data .	The tools of public finance can be used to assess gaps between the individual and the social values of jobs in the case of jobs supported through transfers. Taxation and government spending affect earnings and modify incentives and thus have an impact on resource allocations, including employment. Analyses of the tax burden applying to capital and labor, assessments of cross-subsidization between individuals or firms, or evaluations of the impacts of payroll this amounts to identifying the gaps between the individual and the social values of jobs (if any) that are relevant in a particular country context. Such an evaluation requires data, some of which many countries are now collecting on a more or less regular basis (box 5.5). Using data to measure the full social value of a job calls for rigorous analysis too. Patterns in the data may result from spurious correlations, and the related conclusions may be tainted if individuals and firms with fundamentally different characteristics selected themselves into specific jobs or activities. Labor economics, productivity studies, and other social sciences have developed analytical tools for the analyses required. Sociological and anthropological methods can provide texture and context missing in quantitative data. In some cases, randomized trials or natural experiments can shed light on the mechanisms at play. But methodological pitfalls abound, so the safest approach is to triangulate the available evidence.

Technological progress amounts to combining capital , labor , and skills more efficiently , while applying new knowledge .	At the risk of simplifying, four main forces lie behind increases in an economy's per capita output. The first is the use of more capital per unit of labor. The second is an increase in the number of people working, relative to the total population. This happens when fertility declines and the share of adults in the total population increases; it is also happens when women shift their work from household chores to income-generating activities. The third mechanism through which output can grow is by making people themselves more productive. The acquisition of skills, also known as human capital accumulation, allows a person to do more using the same amount of capital. The fourth mechanism is technological progress, BOX 3.1 What drives economic growth? measured as changes in total factor productivity.

"Ideally, researchers create new knowledge that is supported by strong evidence and is useful for others. Research findings are produced for, and disseminated to, different target audiences. Traditional academic work can be highly technical and narrowly focused, although academic researchers are increasingly encouraged to disseminate their work beyond academic spheres.8 Researchers analysing policy-relevant issues are often keen to engage with policymakers to impart knowledge that can inform policy deliberations and help shape policymaking - this is especially the case with migration. Effective research contributions for policy audiences tend to take the form of short papers and blog articles, as well as policy workshops and interactive expert meetings. 6 GreyNet International, 2014. 7 In order to ensure, to the extent possible, that this chapter provides a comprehensive ""stand-alone"" overview of migration research and analysis in 2017 and 2018, we have drawn upon key background and context material included in the World Migration Report 2018 (chapter 4). 8 McAuliffe, 2016. 127WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 In academia, the main focus is on publishing, with some forms (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than others. A key strength of academic publications is that they have usually been peer reviewed by experts in the field, which typically enhances their quality. The growing number of publishing outlets is, however, characterized by a wide range of peer review standards. Arguably, one of the weaknesses of academic research is that the pressure to publish has contributed to a large increase in academic output in recent years, not always of high-quality material.

Progress in educational access has yielded improvements in adult literacy and educational attainment. Illiteracy among youths has been eradicated in many regions of the world, and the vast majority of young women and men presently have basic reading and writing skills. However, an estimated 781 million people aged 15 and over remain illiterate. Nearly two thirds of them are women, a proportion that has remained unchanged for two decades. Illiteracy rates are highest among older people and are higher among women than men. At age 65 and over, 30 per cent of women and 19 per cent of men are illiterate. The vast majority of older persons are illiterate in Northern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, where gender gaps are also noted.

Annex1 : Socio-economics, gender and policy projects - 70 - technology and innovation would spread from Ghana. Carry out an analysis of the impact on African countries of reducing support to U.S. peanut sector and impact of World Trade Organization's (WTO) changes on U.S. and West African countries; there is a need to look at SPS issues. Makerere University professor of Animal Science (Dr. Connie Kyalisiima) has proposed to carry out research in managing aflatoxin using Bentonite clay in animal feeds in Uganda, to be funded by NORAD (Norway) and in collaboration from Peanut CRSP. Experience working on gender issues in Peanut CRSP research in a host country like Uganda would provide strategies of mainstreaming gender in peanut research which Peanut CRSP could use in its work in developing countries. In the future, Peanut CRSP projects should include in their design strategies to ensure that women and children, who are usually disadvantaged groups in rural farming areas, would benefit directly from new technological interventions (i.e., resistant peanut varieties, aflatoxin-free peanut products, etc.) by Peanut CRSP. The ongoing work in aflatoxin in peanut in Uganda/region is linked with the HIV/AIDS and other illnesses. Possible solution to the aflatoxin problem (i.e., use of Bentonite clay), has implications to people's health. Work on health issues would require critical participation of the Ugandan Ministry of Health and trained village health workers, an area where Peanut CRSP is not a traditional player. Partnership with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Trade, and the Ugandan Board of Standards is required to tackle the health, trade, and related issues in a coherent manner. In Ghana and Benin the analysis of samples should be moved off dead center and the level of awareness of health risks should be established. Forward steps should be taken to establish the link between aflatoxin and the possible abatement of the HIV Aids pandemic, as a basis for opening the flow of health funding toward agro/health (CRSP) research and outreach.

Indeed, they start from the observation that research on recognised refugees remains too rare in studies on asylum conditions in Europe. The vast majority of academic work focuses on the situation of candidates for refugee status before their application is recognised or rejected. The articles presented in this dossier examine this ""after"" time.

However , farm mechanization has spread widely since the mid1980s , which has led to a rapid increase in labor productivity and helped sustain the profitability of rice farming and its competitiveness in the world market .	The rice planted area grew rapidly from 6.9 million ha in 1968 to 9.8 million ha in 1988, and since then has fluctuated between 9.0 and 10.0 million ha depending on the relative price of rice in the world market. Rice production increased from 12.4 to 21.2 million t during the first two decades of the Green Revolution. Rice yield increased relatively slowly compared with that in other Asian countries, from 1.79 t/ha in 1968 to 2.15 t/ha in 1988, because of the predominance of the rainfed rice ecosystem and farmers' preference to grow high-quality, low-yielding traditional varieties that fetch a premium price in the domestic and the world market. Since 1988, rice production and yield have increased very little. The present rice yield of 2.33 t/ha is one of the lowest in the world.

"In this research , these six areas are encapsulated in the term "" women and women 's organizations ."	"To narrow the research to a feasible scope, we focused on specific areas of women's leadership. Women's leadership was examined in six main areas:6 (1) women in leadership roles within disaster management or civil protection authorities; (2) women leading humanitarian programs for national or local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), or leading these NGOs themselves; (3) women with leadership roles in community disaster committees; (4) organizations focused on women and women's rights that are shaping humanitarian assistance; (5) women-led networks and associations focused on engaging with the humanitarian system; and (6) women's leadership in peacekeeping and police missions. These areas are based on the local and national governments and civil society organizations typically included within LHL (Els 2017). Working in these six areas helps ensure a strong commitment to the rights of women and girls and enables women's organizations to have decision-making and influencing power across the full spectrum of humanitarian action, including response, resilience, recovery, disaster risk reduction, peacekeeping, and peace negotiations. In this research, these six areas are encapsulated in the term ""women and women's organizations."" Because LHL is focused on transferring power and resources to local and national institutional actors, we have concentrated on more formal, institutional forms of women's leadership rather than on informal ones. Leadership can have different meanings depending on the context; to help narrow our scope, we decided to focus more on positionality (i.e., women in positions of leadership within organizations, or women's organizations that head projects within the humanitarian system such as the cluster system). Thus, though we did look at women in leadership positions in community disaster committees, we did not explore many other informal types of women's leadership. We recognize, however, that women's leadership in communities frequently occurs at the grassroots level, where they exhibit power, agency, and knowledge, though they may lack formal titles or connection to a formally registered organization."

Strength: Rate of progress on the achievement of the project objectives has been very satisfactory and can be attributed to a broad-based and very experienced U.S. and ANAPO teams, which should ensure maximum success. Technology transfer through the program has resulted in production above present consumption, which may cause glut in the market. Purchase by the Japanese company has adsorbed some of the over production. In order for farmers to continue to expand production and reap the economic benefits, research in food technology needs to be implemented to develop an expanded choice of peanut products to expand domestic consumption. Peanut soup and roasted peanuts are the primary uses at present with a peanut beverage served in restaurants. A valuable linkage with the Philippine and Thailand projects could be made to introduce the Industry Incubator concept to transfer food processing technologies from research to the processor.

When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.

In the years since , his work has ranged across a breathtaking variety of subjects , from rent control and real estate bubbles to property rights , civil disobedience , and carbon emissions .	"Today, that sense of wonder still permeates Glaeser's work as an urban economist. He deploys the economist's theoretical tool kit to explore questions inspired by his youth in New York. Why do some cities fail while others flourish? What accounts for sky-high housing costs in San Francisco? How does the growth of cities differ in rich and poor countries? ""I have always thought of myself as fundamentally a curious child,"" Glaeser, 52, says. Rather than ""pushing well-established literature forward,"" he seeks to comprehend ""something that I really don't understand when I start out."" While still a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Glaeser made his mark as a theorist of the benefits of agglomeration--the idea that dense and diverse cities are hothouses of innovation, energy, and creativity that fuel economic growth. In the years since, his work has ranged across a breathtaking variety of subjects, from rent control and real estate bubbles to property rights, civil disobedience, and carbon emissions. ""For a couple decades now, Ed has been the leading thinker about the economics of place,"" says Lawrence Summers, a Harvard professor who served as director of the National Economic Council under US President Barack Obama. ""And the economics of urban areas are increasingly being seen as central to broad economic concerns."" Glaeser and Summers are collaborating on a study of the hardening divide between welleducated, affluent coastal regions of the United States and islands of economic stagnation in what they call the ""eastern heartland,"" the interior states east of the Mississippi River. There, in cities like Flint, Michigan, the proportion of prime-age men who aren't working has been rising--along with rates of opioid addiction, disability, and mortality."

These include improved germplasm and varieties , improved production practices , new techniques and interventions , and improvement of institutional and human resource capacity .	Approaches: Production efficiency projects are based on scientific research approaches designed to increase production especially under conditions of low or minimized input use. In lesser-developed countries, technologies that exploit genetic resistances or avoidance mechanisms are most likely to impact on peanut production by resourcepoor farmers. These same approaches are the ones most likely to provide benefits to the U.S., where chemical inputs are a major cost and where lowering costs of production is an important requirement for the farmers to remain competitive. Increased efficiency of labor resource utilization will become a paramount issue as the ravages of the HIV epidemic impact labor resources in developing countries, and reduced use of pesticides will impact positively on environment preservation. In East/Southern Africa, collaboration with ICRISAT has guided the approach. ICRISAT has been developing varieties with early maturity and resistance to Groundnut Rosette Virus disease (GRV) and the Peanut CRSP has worked both upstream (evaluating variability) and downstream enabling the national programs to test and release adapted varieties. In this cluster a number of projects are utilizing or developing biotechnology tools to allow for improved efficiency of crop improvement (gene-probes/markers and genetic manipulation) to access and evaluate novel genes that have the potential to provide solutions to otherwise intractable problems. 2. Outputs/achievements: 2.1. Technical In many cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies.

Resource-rich countries face similar pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and the commodity booms of the last few years have only made these pressures stronger. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance are needed to jump-start development, cope with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact on export diversification.77 An enabling business environment. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase, is the top constraint in low-and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets have the potential to allocate resources toward more productive uses, thwart the channeling of resources to those with political connections or economic power, and expand financial in- those jobs. If this is the case, policies should remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily removed, offsetting them may be an option, but the costs and benefits of doing so need to be carefully assessed.

High-level government officials, including the President, made xenophobic statements about refugees and migrants. During the preelection campaign, the Minister of Interior presented as a success the restrictive policies that led refugees to avoid the Czech Republic. In February, the police discontinued their investigation into the 2016 death of a Roma man at a pizzeria in Zatec, determining that no crime had been committed. The man died after he was restrained by municipal police 144 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 officers and some customersas a result of his allegedly aggressive behaviour. The victim's family had filed a complaint against the police in January, alleging that the investigation was not thorough; their lawyer criticized the police for failing to secure the scene and evidence. In May, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Czech authorities to remove a pig farm from the site of a former Nazi concentration camp, where most of the victims were Roma, in the village of Lety u Pisku. While appreciating the government's efforts to buy the land, the Commissioner was concerned over the length of the process, and the government's repeated failure to remove the pig farm and create a memorial as a measure of reparation for the Roma who suffered and died there during the Second World War. In November, the government signed a contract to buy offthe land from the owner of the pig farm and made a commitment to build a memorial on the site.

In the WEAI and its subindexes, an individual is empowered if he or she enjoys adequate achievements in 80 percent of the weighted indicators or more. But we can also explore the range of achievements among empowered and disempowered women more closely. Each woman has an empowerment score, which is the percentage of domains (or, equivalently, weighted indicators) in which she has achieved adequacy. It is then easy to identify who has achieved adequacy in less than 40 percent of the domains, for example. If we consider this group to be the most disempowered, then it becomes possible to target the group, for example, for special services. The situation of the most disempowered can be further analyzed to facilitate targeting: Where do these women live? What are their educational and wealth levels and their social groups? In what kind of production are they primarily engaged? What are their age and educational differentials from their spouses? And so on. It is also possible to identify the women who are disempowered and are deprived in any one particular indicator, such as control over income, to provide specific interventions related to this indicator.

For example, the PDD's recently updated strategy promotes managing displacement risks through moving ""out of harm's way in a dignified manner, through the creation of pathways for safe, orderly and regular migration"".31 The PDD's work plan states that migration can be a response to disaster risk.32 29 States have increasingly engaged at intergovernmental level on migration, environment and climate change within IOM's intergovernmental policy dialogues, including the International Dialogue on Migration (IDM) and the regular meetings of IOM's governing bodies (such as IOM Council), as well as regional policy discussions linked to regional migration consultative processes supported by IOM.

In other terms , BAs and VCs look for scalable investments , that is , companies that can substantially grow their revenues within a few years ( Villalobos and Payne , 2007 ) .	Profile of firms 393. Angel investment concerns mainly seed and early stage companies, including young firms that are beyond the start-up phase but need capital to develop their product or business strategy. BAs invest largely, though not exclusively, in knowledge-based sectors. In fact, compared to VCs, BAs invest in a wider range of sectors, including traditional ones, and geographies, which are not limited to VC hotbeds and are typically related to the BA's entrepreneurial experience and personal networks. However, a common trait of the target companies is a high-growth potential and likelihood to generate substantial revenues over the mid-to long-term (3-8 years). In other terms, BAs and VCs look for scalable investments, that is, companies that can substantially grow their revenues within a few years (Villalobos and Payne, 2007). 394. As is the case for VCs, angel investors bridge the financing gap for new ventures that is largely due to information asymmetry. Since they tend to invest in an earlier stage of the business development than VCs, for BAs the asymmetry may be even more relevant. This also explains the greater emphasis placed by BAs on the personal relationship and trust with the entrepreneur, who should be willing to relinquish some control on the firm and accept an active role of the BA in the development of the business strategy. 395. Generally, the most appropriate time for companies to seek angel investment is when a product or service is developed or near completion and there exists a base of customers or potential customers that confirmed their interest in buying it. BAs are usually under little pressure to make an investment in order to generate income or capital growth. They can afford to wait until they identify the right opportunity and the right person. This means that entrepreneurs that seek angel investments need to be able to present not only an appealing idea and business plan but also themselves effectively (Stuart et al., 2007).

IOM, with the support of government authorities and local communities, started mapping crossborder and in-country population flows between Guinea and Mali as early as December 2014. This information was then mapped against epidemiological data, enabling further analysis of vulnerabilities of travellers along their mobility continuums. Similar initiatives were subsequently set up at the Forecariah-Kambia border between Guinea and Sierra Leone, as well as at the Liberia-Sierra Leone border. Mobility mapping has since been expanded to include several sea landing points along the shores of Freetown and Port Loko, as well as internal movement between Kambia and Port Loko Districts in Sierra Leone.

The biggest challenge is to reach the largest number of people, especially those at risk and who can't rapidly reach healthcare facilities. This challenge is being overcome by intensifying the publicity of the project through several channels (social media - Facebook, Instagram, website, open media - TV, supporter and partner sites - UFPE, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Hospital Clinics, etc.), and mainly based on our user's experience (word-of-mouth). The second is to incorporate these new digital practices into the routine of health professionals. Awareness and training are being used to overcome this challenge. This project is organizationally and financially sustainable, since telehealth has already proved to be viable and an important instrument to complement face-to-face healthcare.

Sector of employment sector varies by gender as well as by education. Employment in agriculture is more prevalent among males, while nonagricultural self-employment is more prevalent among females (Figures 6.14a and 6.14b). With no education there is high proportion of males and females in agriculture (69 percent and 60 percent, respectively). However, as education levels increase, females are more likely to be engaged in nonagricultural self-employment than men, who instead stay in agriculture or access wage employment. There are more males in wage employment at each education level, indicating that this sector is harder for females to enter. This could be due to personal preferences or constraints, such as difficulties in balancing childcare with fixed hours wage work or a desire for the flexibility self-employment enables, or due to the unwillingness of employers to hire females.

That's the best achievement in life.""69 Ela Bhatt, a lawyer and the founder of Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India, described her struggle with the language of work, given the multiplicity of tasks that people do every day and over time: ""A small farmer works on her own farm. In tough times, she also works on other farms as a laborer. When the agriculture season is over, she goes to the forest to collect gum and other forest produce. Year round, she produces embroidered items either at a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader who comes to her village to buy goods. Now, how should her trade be categorized? Does she belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sector, or the home-based work sector? Should she be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker?""70 These questions are not merely semantic. The words and categories that are used to describe work have tangible implications. Views on what a job is and what it means almost inevitably influence views on what policies for jobs should look like. Those for whom the word job is associated with the image of a worker in an office or a factory, with an employer and a paycheck, may focus on a supportive investment climate for firms. Those for whom the word also encompasses farming, street vending, waste picking, and domestic employment may think of jobs policies as including land reform, agricultural extension, urban policies, or the provision of voice to the most vulnerable workers."

While the intensification of crop-based agriculture has been associated with a significant increase in the use of inorganic fertilizer, the application of fertilizer per hectare is far lower in Sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region of the world. One of the major reasons is the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices. Fertilizer prices are usually two to three times higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and Latin America because of poor infrastructure and trade logistics.13 Another major constraint on fertilizer application is the lack of credit for smallholders, given that land ownership titles are seldom secured and hence cannot be used as collateral.14 Therefore, productivity growth in agriculture also requires a favorable investment climate including improved access to infrastructure and credit.15 troducing new varieties and so tend not to make the effort.

"96 INCB REPORT 2015 action plan"", which has helped to improve resource targeting and thereby to gather more accurate data on methamphetamine abuse and trafficking. The increase in smuggling of small amounts of methamphetamine in 2014 may have occurred in response to increased law enforcement pressure on the diversion of precursors and on clandestine laboratories. 749. The Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority has emphasized the role of joint regional operations in large methamphetamine seizures. For example, in July 2015, a sea container sent from South America to Fiji contained 80 kg of methamphetamine and was intercepted in a joint operation of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. 750. The Australian Crime Commission has also determined that, of all drug types, methamphetamine poses the greatest threat to the Australian public because of its increasing purity and the involvement of organized criminal groups. In its 2013/14 report, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service asserted that seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants had increased by nearly 19per cent from the previous year. Most of the amphetamine-type stimulants were detected in cargo and in postal consignments. In the 2014/15 reporting period, the Service maintained its focus on detecting and seizing amphetamine-type stimulants in postal consignments, while the country's law enforcement authorities expressed concern about the potential for transnational organized criminal groups to exploit the market for synthetic drugs. 751. In 2014, law enforcement authorities in Australia reported ""ecstasy"" seizures of several tons each. The Australian Crime Commission indicated that a seizure of almost two tons made in November 2014 was indicative of the resurgence of the ""ecstasy"" market in both the country and the region. The Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System reported that in 2014 the availability of ""ecstasy"" pills, powder, and capsules appeared to have increased significantly from 2013. In 2013, amphetaminetype stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, were the most detected drug at the Australian border."

As a result of extreme overcrowding in prisons in Rio Grande do Sul state , some people detained by police were held for more than 48 hours in unsuitable areas in police stations and cars , while waiting for space in the prison system .	The prison system remained overcrowded and prisoners suffered inhuman and degrading conditions. The prison population reached 727,000 people, 55% of whom were aged between 18 and 29 and 64% of whom were Afro-descendant, according to the Ministry of Justice. A significant proportion - 40% nationally - of those imprisoned were in pre-trial detention, where detainees often waited several months to face trial. In January, riots took place in prisons in several states resulting in at least 123 deaths: 64 in Amazonas state; 31 in Roraima; 26 in Rio Grande do Norte; and two in Paraiba.3 In May, 32 people escaped from Pedrinhas prison in Maranhao state; two escapees were killed by prison guards. As a result of extreme overcrowding in prisons in Rio Grande do Sul state, some people detained by police were held for more than 48 hours in unsuitable areas in police stations and cars, while waiting for space in the prison system. In October, a man died after being detained for a day and a night in an outdoor cage-like cell in a police station in Barra do Corda, Maranhao state. The cell had no protection from the sun or extremely high temperatures, leaving detainees at risk of dehydration and other dangerous consequences of exposure. In Rio de Janeiro state, inhumane prison conditions were further degraded by the financial crisis, putting at risk the supply of food, water and medicines for more than 50,800 prisoners. Tuberculosis and skin diseases reached epidemic levels inside the state's prisons. The 25th anniversary of the Carandiru massacre, in which 111 people were killed by the police in Carandiru prison, Sao Paulo, was on 2 October. Those responsible for the massacre had yet to be held accountable.

Migration of workers Precise figures on the global number of international migrants are not available, an unsurprising fact given that a number of them cross borders illegally or do not return once their visas and permits expire. That is why estimates tend to rely on population censuses and household surveys. Even then, differences across countries in the way that data are gathered, and in the way legislation defines nationality and migratory status, make accurate counts difficult.1 The orders of magnitude are relatively uncontroversial, however.

Although the oil and energy sectors have driven Nigeria 's economy in the last decade , there are other emerging sectors such as IT & technology , services and banking .	Job prospects boosted by English skills English language proficiency is widely recognised as a key skill for career success in Nigeria. In a country in which the job market is shrinking and where wages start at US$120 per month (the official minimum level set by Nigerian Government for 2009), an English-speaking professional can earn on average US$636, with English skills a factor influencing this. According to trade interviews with 30 companies, the salary of non-English and English speakers can differ by as much as 25-30% on average in favour of English speakers. English language skills are regarded as a key requirement for an individual to obtain a better-paid position. On-going investment in the Nigerian economy from English-speaking countries further drives demand for English speakers to service new international companies. FDI drops, Ease of Doing Business ranking falls FDI in Nigeria was US$5.9 billion in 2009, a decline of 7% over 2005-2009. According to the United National Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Nigeria's rich hydrocarbon reserves are the main magnet for foreign investment, and up to 85% of government revenue stems from the oil industry. Although the oil and energy sectors have driven Nigeria's economy in the last decade, there are other emerging sectors such as IT & technology, services and banking. These rapidly developing sectors are also the ones that are requiring the most English speakers according to the 30 companies interviewed. In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business scale, which covers 183 countries, Nigeria was downgraded from 109th position in 2005 to 125th in 2010. Government corruption, excessive bureaucracy, weak transport and business infrastructures, the relatively high operating costs for doing business and the high level of criminality, in addition to the lack of skilled labour, were the major reasons for this downgrade. These factors all represent significant barriers to development, as does the sporadic violence caused by religious conflict, especially in the north of Nigeria.

We can see from an airplane how the cities extend further and further : more houses , more streets , and more parking lots .	Money makes overshoot Invisible Overshoot has many faces. It can mean a bird species driven from its habitat, perhaps even driven to extinction, or an entire ecosystem damaged by overuse. For affluent city dwellers, which include most Germans, the overshoot phenomenon is often only experienced aesthetically. We can see from an airplane how the cities extend further and further: more houses, more streets, and more parking lots. One used to need maybe a half and hour to walk out of a city and enjoy nature; today it takes twice as long. But often, overshoot can be invisible, especially to people with financial means. One example is tourism: the affluent often stop travelling to regions of the world if they become impoverished, if social tensions rise or they become unpredictable a digression: looking back - an example of overshoot in early civilization The first evidence of the destruction of an ecosystem comes from the Sumerians about 2400 BCE. The geology of the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates made food production especially difficult. In spring both rivers were swollen with large amounts of water; between August and October, the period when farms most need water, the rivers shrank into tiny rivulets. The Sumerians developed one of the world's first artificial irrigation systems. The productivity of the ecosystems rose as did grain harvests.

This reborn chronical is moderated by a group of specialised lawyers who are developing a network around issues such as international migration law (conventions, protocols), reception and protection conditions for unaccompanied minors, protection and promotion of the social rights of migrants, human rights as protection of migrants' rights, access to health, labour law for irregular migrants. 25 Articles cited in the journal editors' contribution can be found at: https://journals.openedition.org/remi/. 339WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 REMI celebrated its 30th anniversary by publishing a special issue entitled ""Renewing the Migration Issues"" (32/3-4 2016). This special volume brought together original and diversified contributions. In addition to the classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists. Through these exchanges, the function of scientific journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use of categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place of migration in multicultural societies are examined.

"Ideally, researchers create new knowledge that is supported by strong evidence and is useful for others. Research findings are produced for, and disseminated to, different target audiences. Traditional academic work can be highly technical and narrowly focused, although academic researchers are increasingly encouraged to disseminate their work beyond academic spheres.8 Researchers analysing policy-relevant issues are often keen to engage with policymakers to impart knowledge that can inform policy deliberations and help shape policymaking - this is especially the case with migration. Effective research contributions for policy audiences tend to take the form of short papers and blog articles, as well as policy workshops and interactive expert meetings. 6 GreyNet International, 2014. 7 In order to ensure, to the extent possible, that this chapter provides a comprehensive ""stand-alone"" overview of migration research and analysis in 2017 and 2018, we have drawn upon key background and context material included in the World Migration Report 2018 (chapter 4). 8 McAuliffe, 2016. 127WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 In academia, the main focus is on publishing, with some forms (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than others. A key strength of academic publications is that they have usually been peer reviewed by experts in the field, which typically enhances their quality. The growing number of publishing outlets is, however, characterized by a wide range of peer review standards. Arguably, one of the weaknesses of academic research is that the pressure to publish has contributed to a large increase in academic output in recent years, not always of high-quality material.

The gender gap has narrowed, and in some regions girls tend to perform better in school than boys and progress in a more timely manner. However, in some developing countries that have not reached gender parity, the disparities against girls are stark. Today, 58 million children of primary school age are out of school worldwide.

"Preparations for the Youth Summit took place in the country cabins and other traditional dwellings in the International Wilderness Camp in the Bavarian Forest National Park. With the support of the GTZ and the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU, see the Infobox on pg. 90) and a network of cooperation partners, the International Wilderness Camp was built as a place for sustainable development educational activities. It conveys an impression of the diverse ways of life in our world. The summit participants were accommodated in lodgings that are typical for the National Park's partner conservation programs in Benin, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Vietnam, Siberia, the Czech Republic, and Mongolia. Within 10 days in the International Wilderness Camp, the young people developed the political messages and creative artistic contributions that were introduced above. But the Footprint was not only a central theme during the Youth Summit. Just like other overarching topics such as climate change and resource consumption, it forms a regular part of the weeklong educational programs for school classes and youth groups. These take place in the country cabins of the International Wilderness Camp. The students, who live in the traditional dwellings, try to understand the topics from the perspectives of their ""host countries"" or the conservation areas which are partners of the Bavarian Forest National Park. The central questions of the week-long program, which is conceived for students in their 10th to 13th school year, are: What is behind the idea of the Footprint? How large is our country's Footprint and those of other countries? What does this all have to do with nature preservation and conservation areas? What role does each of us play in this? ""Living well within the means of one planet"" - Is this at all possible? If yes, how? The ""Chair Metaphor"", the ""Loop Game"" or the ""Quotation Line"" serve as educational starting points."

Reduced FDI from France over 2006-2008, English-speaking countries hold low share France is the main single source of foreign investment in Cameroon. However, FDI inflow from France declined to only US$53 million in 2008, down from just over US$113 million in 2006. FDI from the US also fell from US$33 million in 2005 to just US$4 million in 2008 in fixed exchange rate terms, according to the OECD. The main reason behind the decline in overall FDI from 2006 onwards is high commodity prices on items such as coffee and palm oil as well as the global economic downturn. Other leading investors in Cameroon include Germany, Belgium and China, with the gas and oil industry attracting the most investment. The FDI of English-speaking countries represented less than 2% of total FDI in Cameroon in 2008. This has a dampening effect on the development of English in Cameroon, particularly when compared with high levels of French FDI. Nevertheless, this has not diminished the importance placed on the English language by ambitious individuals or the government. 375 264 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow (2005-2009) - US$ million English language quantitative indicators !

Programmes to be funded by ECW need to be underpinned by a sound analysis of the situation relating to all five collective education outcome areas .	"ECW requires a certain number of processes to be followed to improve accountability. Programmes to be funded by ECW need to be underpinned by a sound analysis of the situation relating to all five collective education outcome areas. Support will be provided, where needed, to strengthen implementing partners' capacity to undertake this analysis. All programmes need to ensure strong gender10 and protection components and integrate targeted actions that address barriers to equity and gender equality in partnership with cross-sectoral partners, women's organizations and the government. In addition, a risk analysis is required as part of the Multi-Year Resilience proposal process and ECW reviews programmes to ensure these do not exacerbate inequalities (""do no harm""). ECW will develop an accountability policy and strategy to bring all these elements together and ensure they are implemented."

Technical In many cases , projects have led to the development of improved technologies .	Approaches: Production efficiency projects are based on scientific research approaches designed to increase production especially under conditions of low or minimized input use. In lesser-developed countries, technologies that exploit genetic resistances or avoidance mechanisms are most likely to impact on peanut production by resourcepoor farmers. These same approaches are the ones most likely to provide benefits to the U.S., where chemical inputs are a major cost and where lowering costs of production is an important requirement for the farmers to remain competitive. Increased efficiency of labor resource utilization will become a paramount issue as the ravages of the HIV epidemic impact labor resources in developing countries, and reduced use of pesticides will impact positively on environment preservation. In East/Southern Africa, collaboration with ICRISAT has guided the approach. ICRISAT has been developing varieties with early maturity and resistance to Groundnut Rosette Virus disease (GRV) and the Peanut CRSP has worked both upstream (evaluating variability) and downstream enabling the national programs to test and release adapted varieties. In this cluster a number of projects are utilizing or developing biotechnology tools to allow for improved efficiency of crop improvement (gene-probes/markers and genetic manipulation) to access and evaluate novel genes that have the potential to provide solutions to otherwise intractable problems. 2. Outputs/achievements: 2.1. Technical In many cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies. These include improved germplasm and varieties, improved production practices, new techniques and interventions, and improvement of institutional and human resource capacity. 2.1.1 Genetic Improvement Improved varieties and useful germplasm have been released, developed or identified in a number of projects (UFL 16, TAM17, UGA28, NMX53): Disease resistant varieties in experimental plots in Ghana.

There are two main challenges in the analysis of epidemic data. First, the 1meliness requirements are high while data processing is difficult. Because the analysis involves massive data of millions of users in mul1ple ci1es, it is necessary to preprocess the data and perform feature extrac1on in the process of mul1dimensional analysis and combine machine learning for model training and op1miza1on at the same 1me. However, the situa1on of the epidemic is changing rapidly, and early detec1on can prevent it earlier. Fortunately, we have an excellent technical team and sufficient compu1ng resources. Amer several rounds of program discussions, the efficiency of data processing has been effec1vely improved to meet the 1meliness requirements. Second, the difficulty of team communica1on during the epidemic increased. Because of work from home during the epidemic, communica1on between colleagues is not smooth, and it is easy to delay the project process. To this end, we ac1vely formulate a remote communica1on mechanism. This project contributes to the realiza1on of sustainable development. In the short term, it is difficult to completely eliminate the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been received globally. Thus, the epidemic preven1on and control work has been gradually normalized.

The second part consists of case studies on selected financing instruments ( crowdfunding , securitisation , covered bonds , corporate bonds and private placements ) , developed in cooperation with the Committee on Financial Markets .	45. The project consists of two parts. The first part maps the financing instruments available to SMEs and entrepreneurs ('Mapping Report'). This takes into account existing reports from governments, public agencies, international organisations, research institutes, non-governmental organisations, financial institutions and business associations, as well as the academic literature in the field. As lack of comprehensive data is a major obstacle to the analysis in this field, a specific effort is devoted to improving the factual base on market trends and diffusion of non-debt financing instruments, to complement the information on SME access to finance from the Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs: An OECD Scoreboard, which largely focuses on debt instruments. 46. The second part consists of case studies on selected financing instruments (crowdfunding, securitisation, covered bonds, corporate bonds and private placements), developed in cooperation with the Committee on Financial Markets. The cases examine the characteristics, diffusion and uptake by new firms and SMEs of selected instruments, assess their effectiveness in supporting innovative or potentially highgrowth firms to overcome financing constraints, evaluate what contextual factors can improve or hamper SMEs' access to these instruments, illustrate policy experiences and programmes outcomes, and identify good practices to promote broader use of alternative financing techniques. The case studies are based on secondary sources, including literature review and public reports, and on interviews with policy makers, SME representatives, practitioners in relevant public and private institutions, other market participants and independent experts.

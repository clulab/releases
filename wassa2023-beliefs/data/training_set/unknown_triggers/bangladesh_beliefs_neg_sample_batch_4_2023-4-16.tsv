"A small-scale rice farmer noted that training took place "" yesterday "" but only farmers "" with more land "" go ( SSI :27 ) ."	"The nature of agricultural extension meant many small-scale farmers were excluded from knowledge and skill transfers. Only 13% of households have attended training or demonstrations. It was reported that training and demonstrations were attended by, ""or for,"" larger farmers. A small-scale rice farmer noted that training took place ""yesterday"" but only farmers ""with more land"" go (SSI:27). This reflects the agricultural department policy of strategically targeting a handful of progressive farmers in each panchayat. A pattern emerges whereby there was unequal access to agricultural extension, which worked against the small-scale cultivators. Thus, small-scale farmers relied on rice cropping with low yields, neither accruing resources to cope with shocks or external knowledge to adapt or enhance cultivation practices."

Scientists are now examining the place of weeds in the entire rice-growing system, with the aim not simply of attacking and killing them by one means or another, but of managing them in a way that will not interfere unduly with rice production. This involves studying the interaction of such components as water, tillage practices, and weeds, and incorporating in the rice plant characteristics that increase competitiveness with weeds, such as early vigor. It also involves investigating naturally occurring pathogens of weeds and how they might be used to suppress weed growth.

"Preparations for the Youth Summit took place in the country cabins and other traditional dwellings in the International Wilderness Camp in the Bavarian Forest National Park. With the support of the GTZ and the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU, see the Infobox on pg. 90) and a network of cooperation partners, the International Wilderness Camp was built as a place for sustainable development educational activities. It conveys an impression of the diverse ways of life in our world. The summit participants were accommodated in lodgings that are typical for the National Park's partner conservation programs in Benin, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Vietnam, Siberia, the Czech Republic, and Mongolia. Within 10 days in the International Wilderness Camp, the young people developed the political messages and creative artistic contributions that were introduced above. But the Footprint was not only a central theme during the Youth Summit. Just like other overarching topics such as climate change and resource consumption, it forms a regular part of the weeklong educational programs for school classes and youth groups. These take place in the country cabins of the International Wilderness Camp. The students, who live in the traditional dwellings, try to understand the topics from the perspectives of their ""host countries"" or the conservation areas which are partners of the Bavarian Forest National Park. The central questions of the week-long program, which is conceived for students in their 10th to 13th school year, are: What is behind the idea of the Footprint? How large is our country's Footprint and those of other countries? What does this all have to do with nature preservation and conservation areas? What role does each of us play in this? ""Living well within the means of one planet"" - Is this at all possible? If yes, how? The ""Chair Metaphor"", the ""Loop Game"" or the ""Quotation Line"" serve as educational starting points."

Second, business-reopening permits and health regulations: Many SMEs struggle to meet the COVID-19 prevention requirements from the local government agencies. Some local governments also push the burden of COVID-19 prevention entirely on businesses. If one COVID-19 case cluster shows up in a business, the business will be closed for a longer period. Third, broken supply chain and logistics: Upstream SME closures are felt by downstream factories that are relying on the parts they produce for SMEs. Without the parts and necessary logistics to bring in materials and ship out products, many factories can barely produce or have no place to store the products. Most of the international shipping companies are slow in getting back to work because of the ongoing epidemic and various travel bans. Fourth, worries about revenue and cash flow: Because of the widespread low market demand, many small businesses have found that reopening only means they continue to pay rent and salaries without revenue. Many will pay staff minimal wages or lay off staff, which can further reduce demand.

For instance , policies for jobs may aim to improve compliance with rights , prosecuting forced labor and harmful forms of child labor .	A key question to ask is what purpose policies serve (figure 7.3). For instance, policies for jobs may aim to improve compliance with rights, prosecuting forced labor and harmful forms of child labor. Because fundamental labor rights and principles have been endorsed by most countries, promoting compliance with rights amounts to providing a global public good. Thus, interventions against human trafficking or child prostitution in one country are unlikely to have adverse effects in other countries and do not lead to a competition for jobs.

When asked about their most preferred jobs, survey respondents from four diverse countries provide different answers from those they offer when asked about the most important jobs to society (figure 5.1). They frequently mention working in the civil service or as a shop owner as the jobs they would prefer for themselves, while identifying teachers and doctors as the most important jobs for societies. China is the only country where a job in civil service is seen as more important for society than for the individual. In the Arab Republic of Egypt, a job as a teacher is more valued individually than socially.

As arable land becomes scarce , the development of yield-enhancing technologies is indispensable .	An example is targeting in the agricultural sector. The underlying logic is based on the notion of public goods. The biggest obstacles to agricultural development are the lack of appropriate technologies and adequate infrastructures. As arable land becomes scarce, the development of yield-enhancing technologies is indispensable.120 But incentives to generate these technologies are undermined because they can be replicated freely.121 Thus, public policy plays a role by supporting the development and dissemination of such technologies.

Advances in digital technology could enable more and more people to move towards self-directed investment using online platforms, fundamentally changing how the current industry works. I see this as a huge growth area going forwards for new entrants. There is also an interesting question as to where technological innovation will come from in future. Traditionally, it has mostly come from areas like Silicon Valley, but with success stories such as Alibaba in China, it may be the case that we will start to see more innovation coming from the East.

The current government amended rather than ratified this ordinance , giving back some judicial powers to executive magistrates .	But continued commitment needs to be shown. The judiciary is not fully separated from the executive. Although the Caretaker Government ordinance all but abolished executive magistrates, restricting their jurisdiction to administrative public order duties, all ordinances made by a Caretaker Government require ratification by an elected government. The current government amended rather than ratified this ordinance, giving back some judicial powers to executive magistrates. There are claims that these powers are open to abuse by the executive and are often poorly executed resulting in miscarriages of justice and frequent appeals to the District Judge for reversal or setting aside of the decisions of executive magistrates. The matter was in the High Court after a writ was brought by NGOs.55 Quality and efficiency is low. Judicial quality, particularly in the subordinate courts, has declined over the period partly due to poor salaries and benefits that are unable to compete with the private sector for the most able candidates.56 Judicial training has also been inadequate although attempts have been made to address this through improved access to training courses at the Judicial Administrative Training Institute.

Food manufacturing ( ISIC 15 ) , for example , is important for employment but as a relatively capital-intensive sector , its employment returns to the same amount of investments will be fairly limited .	Incentives and support programs might benefit from taking into account sectoral potential for job creation. One measure that could help guide targeting is to consider the labor intensity in different sectors, particularly for unskilled labor. Table D.4 shows a breakdown along this line, where labor intensity is measured as the expenditure share of employment in value added output, which could be considered as the derived labor demand. Food manufacturing (ISIC 15), for example, is important for employment but as a relatively capital-intensive sector, its employment returns to the same amount of investments will be fairly limited. Other high-potential sectors include business activities (ISIC 74) and transport services (ISIC 63), due to their high contribution to aggregate employment and a high labor intensity. In addition, these are also network industries whose growth can have potential to improve services inputs to the rest of the economy. An alternative to ex ante targeting, given the difficulty to predict business success, is to identify emerging successful firms or sectors and consider policies to alleviate the constraints specific to those firms/sectors.

Their success would also matter for productivity reasons. Quite a few currently large enterprises in industrial countries started out as micro-and small family businesses.

Education influences both the occupations where individuals are working , as well as their productivity in these occupations .	Education influences both the occupations where individuals are working, as well as their productivity in these occupations. Higher-educated individuals are more likely to work in the wage sector, and employment in agriculture decreases with educational attainment. Access to wage employment is particularly limited for females relative to males, unless females have tertiary levels of education. In the wage sector, there are positive education earnings premia in wage work for both males and females, and signs of nonlinear, convex patterns. Strong heterogeneity in earnings profiles by gender are observed, with women receiving far lower wages at all levels of the education distribution in wage work. In nonagricultural self-employment, however, limited returns to additional years of education are observed, except for highly educated females who stay involved in this sector. Few individuals have opportunities to acquire skills after they have exited the education system. Only 12 percent of the working-age population participates in post-school training. Training provided by private providers is the most common, in particular traditional apprenticeships, which accounts for half of individuals undertaking post-school training. While traditional apprenticeships appear accessible and relevant to individuals with low levels of education, private and public technical and vocational training attract more educated groups.	Education influences both the occupations where individuals are working, as well as their productivity in these occupations.

MTN uses English as its business language for in-house communication and French for external communication, while Orange uses French as its business language both internally and externally in Cameroon. All three companies employ English speakers in their local offices. This demonstrates clear demand for English speakers in one of the most dynamically growing industries, and is a motivating factor for individuals to learn English in order to obtain a well-paid job within one of the most dynamic industries in Cameroon.

The women did the agricultural work , the trading , and the production of the traditional alcohol .	Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro district: Nova Mambone Communities in Nova Mambone were resettled onto higher ground. Previously their livelihoods had consisted of farming, fishing, informal trading, handicrafts, brewing of traditional alcohol, wood cutting and charcoal making, working on the salt flats, and livestock (cattle). The women did the agricultural work, the trading, and the production of the traditional alcohol. Men worked on the salt flats, fished, and kept livestock. After the floods, the majority of the population received improved housing but had lost their livelihoods. Fishing activities have declined, and farming has been difficult due to the drought. Because of a lack of money in the economy, petty trading has not been revived. The families are mainly surviving on food for work projects two years after the floods. Women continue to try to farm. And some are beginning to keep chickens again. Some of the women said they had started a new business of selling meat from game hunted by the men. Men are unable to find work or alternative income sources so they work on the roads in the food for work programs; they no longer have boats or cattle, as they were lost in the floods. Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro District: Nova Mambone (continued) The positive aspects of the recovery process are that they live in areas that are more secure and people are less vulnerable to future flooding. There has been considerable investment in the economic, commercial and social infrastructure, and the road building has bought greater access to previously isolated areas. Some very remote areas are now reachable by boat, and the ferry has linked two potential markets. The district now has electricity, considered to be an important development step. The improved housing has been very important, as people now have greater access to social infrastructure and water supplies. The attitude of people has changed and people are less aggressive, they are pleased with the new plots and want to maintain the new environment in which they live.

Some tutoring is provided entirely by correspondence in the mail or over the internet and in some societies tutoring is provided by telephone ( Bray , 1999 , p.22 ) .	The forms of private tutoring can be varied. In many systems, mainstream teachers themselves provide supplementary private tutoring. In such countries as Australia, France and Singapore, teachers are prohibited from providing such paid tutoring to the children for whom they already have responsibility in the mainstream. However, in such countries as India, Lebanon, Nigeria and Bangladesh it is common for mainstream teachers to provide supplementary tutoring for their own mainstream pupils (Bray, 2006, p.519). Some tutoring is provided one to one in the home of either the tutor or his/ her tutees. Other tutoring is in small groups, in large classes or even in huge lecture-theatres with video screens. Some tutoring is provided entirely by correspondence in the mail or over the internet and in some societies tutoring is provided by telephone (Bray, 1999, p.22). Internet and technology based tutoring most of the time can be found in developed countries or in high income societies. The forms of tutoring differ from country to country.

On the other hand, Hong Kong's failure to modernize its copyright system has allowed it to become vulnerable to digital copyright piracy. Lacking an updated copyright system, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (HKCED) has stepped up enforcement actions to combat digital piracy. In addition, while the HKCED routinely seizes IPR-infringing products arriving from mainland China and elsewhere, U.S. stakeholders report that counterfeit pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and other infringing products continue to transit through Hong Kong in significant quantities.

Enabling Environment scores - - and the Health and Hygiene pillar in particular - - should continually be enhanced in order to compete with Eastern Asia-Pacific .	South-East Asia outscores the global average in overall competitiveness. The subregion depends on T&T more than any other subregion for its GDP, with a particular emphasis on international arrivals versus domestic tourism. Many visitors are attracted to the subregion's combination of rich natural resources and price competitiveness, with the latter being its greatest advantage relative to other countries in the broader Asia-Pacific region. It's no surprise, then, that, given this importance of tourism, the subregion outscores the global and Asia-Pacific scores for T&T prioritization and international openness. In addition, the subregion's above-average air transport infrastructure continues to improve at a rapid pace, especially in regard to the number of operating airlines and route capacity. On the other hand, South-East Asia still trails global and regional means for tourism services infrastructure. Most--but not all--of the subregion's economies also score lower for ground and port infrastructure, hindering travel. Enabling Environment scores--and the Health and Hygiene pillar in particular--should continually be enhanced in order to compete with Eastern Asia-Pacific. Yet this subregion's greatest * World Travel & Tourism Council, Tourism Satellite Account Research, latest year available. weakness relative to the global average is environmental sustainability, which has been impacted by deforestation, an increasing number of threatened species and insufficient wastewater treatment.

Financing and partnership Mobilizing more and better financing for education is a key strategic objective of GPE 2020, as is building a stronger partnership. According to the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, an additional US$44 billion each year would need to be mobilized from international financing to fill the gap for all low-and middle-income countries to achieve universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education.1 However, more financing is not the only challenge: External financing should be allocated to the countries with the greatest education need, and used to support those interventions directly associated with learning for all children. This chapter presents an overview of the GPE grant portfolio,2 using the most recent data to examine where GPE funding goes, and the performance of GPE grants.

Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of the health-care system , integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system .	"A systematic literature review of reported challenges in health-care delivery to migrants and refugees in highincome countries identified three main topics of challenges in health-care delivery: communication, continuity of care and confidence.23 Communication is critical for obvious diagnostic and treatment trajectories. The availability of trained interpreters from migrant communities was described as a key aspect in providing migrant-sensitive care. Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical consultations was also highlighted. Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of the health-care system, integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system. Confidence was the third most common topic mentioned and related to trust in the health-care provider, ensuring cultural sensitivity in care provision and the ability to have agency. Studies indicated that, in cases where no trustful relationship was established, patients resorted to using traditional medicine and trusted ""their own resources"" from their community for treatment. Conversely, a systematic review that investigated the perceptions, attitudes and practices of health providers in the provision of health-care services for migrants found they were challenged not only by language and cultural barriers, but also by resource constraints within their workplaces, and incoherence between professional ethics and domestic laws that limited migrants' right to health care.24 Health-care providers used innovative means to ensure care provision in managing such clinical cases with civil society groups."

These groups also state that having to work is another common reason why they cannot attend school.

Thus, schooling and retirement gain importance relative to work. For the past century or so, the number of hours worked by youth in industrial countries has declined steadily as access to education has increased. Similarly, the number of years in retirement has increased in parallel with longer life expectancy.1 Higher earnings also facilitate longer periods of job seeking, especially among younger household members, often leading to higher unemployment rates. Among men and women of prime age (25 to 54), total working hours (market and nonmarket) have remained relatively stable, with the main change being the growing share of market activities among women (figure 2.1).

The group had been arrested in Mwingi in March and charged before a Magistrate Court with being in Kenya unlawfully .	Kenya continued to host almost 500,000 refugees, most of whom resided in Dadaab refugee camp in Garissa County, and Kakuma refugee camp in Turkana County. Other refugees were located in Nairobi. The majority of refugees in Dadaab were from Somalia; the majority of refugees in Kakuma were from South Sudan. By September, appeals for international support from UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, for the regional refugee crisis had secured only 27% of the necessary funding. In February, the High Court declared the 2016 government directive to close Dadaab refugee camp by May 2017 to be in violation of the Constitution and Kenya's obligations under international law with regard to the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of race or ethnicity. Thus, Dadaab refugee camp remained open. The ruling also stated that the government's move to revoke the assumed refugee status of Somalis who had fled to Kenya was unconstitutional and violated rights guaranteed in national and international instruments. The authorities continued the voluntary repatriation of Somali refugees, initiated in 2014 under the Tripartite Agreement framework. Between May 2016 and September 2017, over 70,000 refugees were repatriated from Dadaab to Somalia. On 17 February, the Court of Appeal upheld a 2013 High Court ruling which quashed government directives to round up all refugees living in urban areas and relocate them to refugee camps, as part of a plan to repatriate them. On 25 April, a High Court in Garissa ordered the deportation of 29 Somali asylum-seekers to Somalia. The group had been arrested in Mwingi in March and charged before a Magistrate Court with being in Kenya unlawfully. The magistrate ordered that they be taken to Dadaab refugee camp and registered by the Refugee Affairs Secretariat (RAS); however, the RAS officer refused to register them. The magistrate's order was ultimately quashed by the High Court and all 29, including 10 children, were deported to Somalia on 4 May 2017.

Despite much progress, many challenges remain, all along the chain, which continues to suffer from undercapitalization and lack of skills, coordination, and organization at all levels. There remain also important and underexplored opportunities for productivity increase in other staples (roots and tubers), which would also help raise women's agricultural labor productivity,66 and employment generation in the expansion of other high-value products (meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables). Value chain studies can further help identify chain-specific constraints.67 To maximize employment generation, inclusive value chain approaches should be promoted.

The trial was marred by irregularities, including documents not being disclosed to defence lawyers. Ahmed Abba had been arrested in Maroua in July 2015 and was tortured while held incommunicado for three months at a facility run by the General Directorate of External Research. On 21 December the Appeal Court of the Yaounde Military Court ordered his initial sentence to be reduced to 24 months, which he had already served. The Court upheld the charge of ""nondenunciation of terrorism"". The appeal of Fomusoh Ivo Feh, who was arrested in December 2014 for forwarding a sarcastic text message about Boko Haram and sentenced to 10 years in prison, had not begun at the end of the year. Scheduled to begin in December 2016, his hearings had been adjourned at least seven times. On 30 October, journalists Rodrigue Tongue, Felix Ebole Bola and Baba Wame were acquitted by the Yaounde Military Court, having been initially charged in October 2014 with ""non-denunciation of information and sources"". Facing trial alongside the journalists were opposition party leader Aboubakary Siddiki, and Abdoulaye Harissou, a well-known notary detained since August 2014. The Yaounde Military Court sentenced Aboubakary Siddiki to 25 years' imprisonment on charges including hostility against the homeland, revolution, and contempt of the President. Abdoulaye Harissou was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and subsequently released having already served this sentence. Their trial was marred by irregularities.

"Our research emphasizes that "" ultimate "" drivers interact with the current mode of rice cultivation to reproduce a low resilience farming state ."	"Developing country deltas are important food producing areas and are home to large numbers of subsistence farmers. In particular, rice farmers dominate the populous deltas of South and Southeast Asia and face frequent climate hazards that have shortand long-term impacts on rice production and livelihoods. The aim of this study is to identify and explain proximal and ultimate factors (land access, cultural practices, and institutional support) that affect rice farmer resilience, that is, to explain why some farmers are more sensitive to climate shocks, why some farmers suffer long-term impacts from climate shocks, and what underlying ""ultimate"" factors reproduce this vulnerability over time. We undertake this analysis using qualitative interviews and household survey data from two districts in the Mahanadi Delta, Odisha, India. We show that climate hazards cause rice production shocks that are problematic for farmers because rice is predominantly used for household consumption in a context of unreliable off-farm income sources and a lack of insurance and credit. Our research emphasizes that ""ultimate"" drivers interact with the current mode of rice cultivation to reproduce a low resilience farming state. We argue that agricultural development interventions seeking to make rice farming more resilient to climate hazards should focus on boosting productivity and shock-resistance, but also be cognizant of the system within which rice farming is practiced and the contextual ""ultimate"" factors that reproduce vulnerability."

Furthermore, successful treatment discontinuation may result in improvement of cognitive and psychomotor function, particularly in older people. 284. As already noted, the Board fully recognizes that hypnotics, sedatives and anxiolytics containing controlled benzodiazepines have been proved to be effective and are essential in medical practice and health care.

Hygiene and sanitation , as well as shelter conditions , are often inadequate .	The Government and humanitarian partners project that at least 8 million people will require humanitarian assistance in 2020. Conflict, displacement and disease outbreaks, as well as rainfall shortages in some parts of the country and flooding in others, will remain key drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia. In 2020, it is estimated that 3.7 million people will continue to be chronically food insecure. In the absence of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and practices, cholera outbreaks are expected to continue to occur. Seasonal flooding is also an annual occurrence, as are invasions by desert locusts and other pests, which are likely to contribute to significant losses in crop harvest and pastures, including in Afar, Amhara, Oromia and Somali regions. The overall condition of IDPs and returnees will continue to be dire. Hygiene and sanitation, as well as shelter conditions, are often inadequate. Protection issues, including gender-based, sexual and physical violence, are areas of concern, as are family separations and psychosocial distress and trauma, and harmful practices such as child marriages. Also of concern is that some people with specific needs are unable to access life-saving services, and that some have no legal redress for lost property and livelihood because they lack documentation. For these reasons, people in need will continue to require sustained multisector humanitarian assistance, recovery and durable solutions well into 2020. An increase in conflicts and displacements remains a possibility in 2020, given the uncertainty around the national elections in May.

Targeting is not necessarily industrial policy The investment climate is the set of public goods and public policies that shape the opportunities and incentives for firms to invest productively, create jobs, and expand.119 It encompasses a wide range of policy levers: ensuring stability and security, enhancing financial markets, providing infrastructure services, reducing regulatory and tax burdens, and improving the quality of the workforce. The natural inclination is to equate a targeted investment climate with industrial policy. If some activities result in large productivity spillovers (because of learning-by-doing, for instance, or because of greater specialization and integration), targeting can imply supporting such activities. In recent years, productivity spillovers associated with various activities have been reexamined from different viewpoints, with both academics and practitioners proposing practical approaches for their identification (box 6.9).

Conversely, the pace of progress in FCACs regarding gender parity in lower secondary completion appears to outperform that of other DCPs (Figure 2.3b), largely because gains for girls in non-FCACs are more likely to result in a slight advantage for girls than they are in FCACs.11 Looking at gender parity in completion rates for individual DCPs (Figure 2.4), two salient patterns emerge: First, a country's gender parity index in primary completion tends to stay relatively consistent into lower secondary, except that cases of girls' disadvantage tend to become more pronounced--dramatically so in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. Second, while underperformance of boys does 11.

In the face of significant health and economic challenges due to epidemics, education is rarely prioritised and education funding may be diverted to the response (Rohwerder, 2020). For example, many teachers' roles were diverted towards disease control and social mobilisation activities during the Ebola outbreak and schools were used as focal points and data points to address and understand the infection rates (Azzi-Huck and Shmis, 2020). We have already seen in this outbreak that boarding schools are being used for temporary isolation centres in Kenya, and educational establishments in Pakistan used for isolation and quarantine centres. These establishments will require refurbishment post-outbreak. 39 There is no clarity on when schools will fully reopen - some classes (those doing exams) restarted in Sierra Leone in early July, in Pakistan it will be 15 July at the earliest, in Bangladesh it is mooted for September, and both Kenya and Uganda have recently announced that they will restart in early 2021. (c) Maintains 75 COVID-19 has resulted in an explosion in distance learning across the world. As just one example of many, Rising Academies is repurposing existing curriculum content into radioready scripts for nationwide broadcasts in Sierra Leone, and have put their scripts online under a creative commons licence.40 While distance learning may not be able to achieve the same curriculum goals, continuing education is important and at the very least it serves a very important function for children to maintain a connection with education, and thus support re-enrolment post crisis.

However, as education levels increase, females are more likely to be engaged in nonagricultural self-employment than men, who instead stay in agriculture or access wage employment. There are more males in wage employment at each education level, indicating that this sector is harder for females to enter. This could be due to personal preferences or constraints, such as difficulties in balancing childcare with fixed hours wage work or a desire for the flexibility self-employment enables, or due to the unwillingness of employers to hire females.

The project includes measures to improve agricultural productivity and resilience by upgrading irrigation systems and livestock practices .	"And yet, according to IMF economists, investing in resilience may cut the costs of postdisaster intervention by at least half. It's a case that international organizations are making to donor groups and nations. ""Never let a good crisis go to waste,"" writes former Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin in her 2014 book The Resilience Dividend. Rodin continues to advocate adaptation to climate change. ""Disasters help get people's attention,"" she says in an interview. ""Before this concept was fully developed, people didn't tend to rebuild resiliently. Everywhere, it's the poor and vulnerable who get hit the hardest, whether they live on an island or in a city."" In March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai blasted Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe with days of high winds and heavy rains, killing more than 1,300 people. A month later, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth hit some of the same areas and compounded the devastation, bringing total damages from the two storms to $4 billion. It was the first instance on record of such sequential disasters in a single season and left almost 3 million people without housing, electricity, or running water. More than 800,000 hectares of crops were wiped out. ""Malawi is one of the least developed countries in the world and also one of the countries hardest hit by climate change,"" says Pritha Mitra, the IMF's mission chief for Malawi. ""We are looking at adapting to climate change and whether it's actually an opportunity to not only boost growth, but also reduce inequality. In sub-Saharan African countries, the people who are most affected by climate change are the poorer households, so climate change is exacerbating already-large inequalities."" In the cyclones' aftermath, the African Development Bank approved a $100 million, fouryear grant program that would directly benefit 1 million people across the three countries. The project includes measures to improve agricultural productivity and resilience by upgrading irrigation systems and livestock practices. In addition, it envisions making infrastructure such as roads, electrical grids, water supplies, and sanitation systems more resistant to big storms. The program will also enhance early-warning systems and institutional and community capacity to respond to disasters."

Irrigation potential is much greater, estimated at more than 3 million ha along the Senegal, Niger, Black Volta, Chari, and Logone rivers. This enormous technical potential has attracted large public investments: the first irrigation schemes were constructed in the Sahel in the 1920s. Until the recent introduction of privatization policies, the state has played a lead role in developing and managing irrigated rice schemes, with over 75% of the areas currently under parastatal control. The remainder is managed by a growing and increasingly dynamic private sector.

Governments understand need for increased investment in education To buttress a strong basic level of English among the population, government expenditure on education as a proportion of overall expenditure is growing. Enrolment in tertiary education is high in Nigeria and Cameroon. Higher education in both is increasingly conducted in English, suggesting that graduates from these countries are better equipped for the international work environment. Rwanda, Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently less prepared, mainly due to lower funding, although this is changing as government expenditure on education increases. The primary motivating factor for improving English skills is the desire to improve employment opportunities. The governments of the five researched countries recognise that there is a clear requirement to invest more in their education systems. Rwanda was most dynamic in this area, with 21% of total government expenditure spent on education. Bangladesh and Cameroon spent some 8% and 17%, respectively. In Nigeria and Pakistan education accounted for 13% and 2% of government expenditure. To put this into perspective, a developed country such as the UK spends 10-12% of total annual expenditure on education. Education seen as poverty escape route Each of the researched countries saw economic growth slow in 2009. However, the fact that English is regarded as offering a key competitive advantage in a difficult employment environment means that demand for English education throughout these countries remained high.

Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security. Irreversible damage to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they provide, worsened by air, soil, water, and marine pollution.  Extreme weather events, many worsened by accelerating sea level rise, will particularly affect urban coastal areas in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Damage to communication, energy, and transportation infrastructure could affect low-lying military bases, inflict economic costs, and cause human displacement and loss of life.  Changes in the frequency and variability of heat waves, droughts, and floods--combined with poor governance practices--are increasing water and food insecurity around the world, increasing the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jordan.  Diminishing Arctic sea ice may increase competition--particularly with Russia and China-- over access to sea routes and natural resources. Nonetheless, Arctic states have maintained mostly positive cooperation in the region through the Arctic Council and other multilateral mechanisms, a trend we do not expect to change in the near term. Warmer temperatures and diminishing sea ice are reducing the high cost and risks of some commercial activities and are attracting new players to the resource-rich region.

Plans were developed to resolve major constraints to the host countries and U.S.A. peanut sector and to ensure that social and gender issues were addressed. This 2004-2005 review concluded that the Peanut CRSP had been highly effective in developing technologies through research in the five thematic/cluster areas, and the technologies transferred to farmers, entrepreneurs, and key stakeholders have resulted in significant impacts in the host countries and the U.S.A. The Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree training, short-term training of host country scientists, and training of peanut farmers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders was important to technology transfer and is a major impact of the program.

Governance that the area under the control of indigenous peoples and / or local communities has identifiable institutions and regulations that are responsible for achieving the protected area objectives .	Type D: Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities. This type includes two main subsets: (1) indigenous peoples' areas and territories established and run by indigenous peoples and (2) community conserved areas established and run by local communities. The subsets, which may not be neatly separated, apply to both sedentary and mobile peoples and communities. IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules. These can be relatively complex. For instance, land and/or sea resources may be collectively owned and managed while other resources may be managed individually or on a clan basis. Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times, or of different resources within the same area. Rules generally intertwine with cultural and spiritual values. The customary rules and organizations managing natural resources often possess no statutory legal recognition or sanctioning power. In other cases, however, indigenous peoples and/or local communities are fully recognised as the legitimate authority in charge of state-listed protected areas or have legal title to the land, water or resources. Whatever the structure, the governance arrangements require IUCN recognises four broad types of governance of protected areas, any of which can be associated with any management objective: A. Governance by government B. Shared governance C. Private governance D. Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities 3. Governance that the area under the control of indigenous peoples and/or local communities has identifiable institutions and regulations that are responsible for achieving the protected area objectives.

Never before have we witnessed such a testament to the global importance of migration nor such a widespread ambition to better management of international migration of all kinds and its effects on the migrants , their societies of destination , and their homelands .	2017 and 2018 were years during which the international community, with a degree of co-operation rarely seen in the field of migration, agreed to two sets of guiding policy principles, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees. Never before have we witnessed such a testament to the global importance of migration nor such a widespread ambition to better management of international migration of all kinds and its effects on the migrants, their societies of destination, and their homelands. These agreements were borne out of a sense of crisis with a particular focus on the Mediterranean region; we now wait to see if the hope they inspire will bear tangible fruit. The owner of International Migration, the International Organization for Migration, was heavily involved in the effort to achieve these agreements, especially the Global Compact for Migration. Since the previous World Migration Report, the IOM has become a member of the United Nations family of organizations and, with a membership now of more than 170 states it is a truly global institution. This journal, appropriately, can also claim a global status in that its authors are from around the world and with authors from no single country dominating its contents. International Migration is pleased by its global reach which has been achieved despite the challenges associated with publishing double-blind peerreviewed material from less developed countries.

"The ""Healthy Food Promotion Act for Children and Adolescents"" (Law No. 30021), and its 2017 implementing regulations published in Supreme Decree No. 017-2017-SA, establish a mandatory front-ofpack warning statement on food labels for pre-packaged foods and beverages that surpass thresholds set by Peru for sugar, sodium, and saturated fats, and for all food products that contain trans-fats. The Act also establishes limitations on advertising and promoting such food and beverage products to children and adolescents, which include restriction on the promotion, advertising, and sale of these products in or around schools. While supportive of Peru's public health objective of reducing obesity and related non-communicable diseases, the United States has a number of questions and concerns with Peru's approach. For example, it is not clear whether Peru considered relevant international standards or less-trade restrictive alternatives when preparing and adopting the measure to improve the quality of nutritional information provided to consumers. The United States has raised these concerns in written comments on the measure and in meetings of the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. In September 2017, Peru notified its manual on health warnings, prepared pursuant to the Regulations Implementing Law No. 30021 to the WTO TBT inquiry point. The Manual contains technical specifications and guidelines for the inclusion of the aforementioned warnings on processed food labels and in media advertisements. In November 2017, the United States submitted written comments to Peru raising its concerns with the measures established by the Manual. In June 2018, Peru published the Manual in its federal register. Manufacturers will be permitted to use temporary stickers to comply with the Manual for 6 months starting June 2019 before needing to use packaging that conforms to the Manual starting December 2019.

There is a need to improve English proficiency of Bulgarian researchers to facilitate their acceptance in U.S. for training. During the review in Bulgaria, there was an awareness and concern about the potential change of status of Bulgaria with respect to Peanut CRSP and the effect on future funding. Part of the time spent at ICFT was devoted to discussing opportunities for EU funding in FP6 and mechanisms for support through Twinning and Maria Curie Fellowships that might be used. The assessment is that the EU is very unlikely to directly continue funding along the same lines as Peanut CRSP but that there might be opportunities to continue to develop the 'Establishment of a Food Research and Development Center for Southern and Eastern Europe'.

They include monuments such as Angkor Wat in Cambodia or the Pyramids of Egypt, and also exceptional natural areas, such as Serengeti National Park in Tanzania or Canaima National Park in Venezuela. Governments nominate sites for possible inclusion on the World Heritage List, with recognition depending on a technical evaluation16 followed by a review and final decision by World Heritage Committee members. Suitability is based in part on whether or not the site has Outstanding Universal Values (OUV), a term referring to the combination of those heritage values of a site that demonstrate how it is of global value and the requirement for a site to have integrity and effective management. IUCN is officially recognised in the text of the Convention as an Advisory Body for all natural and mixed natural-cultural sites. This involves carrying out technical evaluations of all applicant sites and also running monitoring missions as required for existing sites that may be under threat. Virtually all natural World Heritage sites are also protected areas. In the past, World Heritage sites were listed separately on the UN List of Protected Areas but this resulted in duplication, because many were also listed under their IUCN category.

Surges in a country 's foreign exchange earnings generally F I G U R E 16 Three distinct layers of policies are needed Source : World Development Report 2013 team .	Fundamentals: Ensuring the basics Macroeconomic stability. Volatility hurts employment and earnings, often immediately. According to a recent estimate, a 1.0 percent decline in gross domestic product (GDP) is associated with an increase in the unemployment rate of 0.19 percentage point in Japan, 0.45 percentage point in the United States, and 0.85 percentage point in Spain.73 In developing countries, where farming and self-employment are more prevalent and income support mechanisms are more limited, the short-term impact of macroeconomic instability is less on open unemployment and more on earnings from work.74 Volatility can originate internally or be caused by external shocks. Internally, it is often the outcome of unsustainable budget deficits and lax monetary policy. But tight budgets and rigid monetary policy rules may not be a magic wand. Budget deficits are more or less worrisome depending on how quickly an economy is growing, whereas the independence of central banks needs to be weighed against the overall coherence of the country's development strategy. Assessing the soundness of macroeconomic management requires taking account of the impact of fiscal and monetary policies on economic growth.75 Volatility may also result from external shocks, including natural disasters and crises originating abroad. Precautionary policies can cushion those shocks, if and when they occur. Most often, short-term stimulus or adjustment packages are needed--but these tend to be less effective in the developing world than in developed countries because of lower multiplier effects.76 Avoiding exchange rate misalignment is necessary to sustain a vibrant export sector--and thus to create jobs connected to international markets and global value chains.

Summary of Country Gender Profile in Cote d'Ivoire (2013) General Situation of Women  Following the end of the long political crisis in 2011, Cote d'Ivoire is making efforts toward to restoration. However, because of long turmoil of the crisis, statistical data is insufficient, and the development of statistics and a population registration system are pressing issues.  In Cote d'Ivoire, there are various ethnic groups, each with a different language, culture and customs. The social status of women varies in each ethnic group. Generally, the social and economic status of women is low, and they have inadequate access to basic social services and less economic power compared to men. Government Policy  The government of Cote d'Ivoire has adopted policies and action plans to promote gender equality. It is important to assure the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these actions.  The strategy for the fight against gender based violence (GBV) was established in 2012, and it is now in the implementation phase of the action plan.  A project to develop a database of talented women is ongoing under the initiative of the Presidential Office as a way to evaluate and utilize the capacities and talents of women across the country. National Machinery  In 1976, the Ministry for Condition of Woman (Ministere de la Condition de la Femme) was established. Since then, the ministry has been in charge of promoting gender equality. However, the budget has not been sufficiently allocated. Therefore, the allocation of an adequate budget and the establishment of administrative capacity are required.  Gender Groups have not been established in all ministries. Sufficient budget allocation and human resources are challenges for the Gender Groups.

The country's total population grew by 2% per annum over 2005-2009, while the urban population grew by around 4% per annum over the same period. The rural population saw only marginal growth. Urbanisation in Cameroon is driven by the search for employment, the pursuit of higher education in universities and private institutions, and changes in the lifestyles of Cameroonian consumers. Urbanisation is also driven by increased urban infrastructural development, which attracts newcomers to cities, as well as a reduction in agricultural employment.

The specific needs of women and girls are often overlooked , and they are at increased risk of GBV .	The humanitarian situation in Libya is expected to worsen in coming months. Civilians are bearing the burden of increased insecurity: disruptions of livelihoods, social protection, health, education and shelter have a disproportionate effect on the most vulnerable groups in Libya including displaced families, host communities, returnees, and refugees and migrants. The specific needs of women and girls are often overlooked, and they are at increased risk of GBV.

In February 2014, the average number of hours worked a week was around 41.8, with a median around 42 (Figure1.12a). Only 20 percent of employed individuals worked less than 30 hours a week. By contrast, 40 percent of individuals report working more than 60 hours a week. Nonetheless, there are some differences in the number of hours worked by type of employment. Agricultural employment is known to exhibit substantial seasonality, with much lower work during the lean seasons. Individuals in agricultural self-employment worked the least hours compared to other occupations in February 2014, in part due to seasonal patterns (see discussion in Chapters 2 and 3). As discussed in Chapter2, this seasonality in agricultural employment explains a substantial share in differences in average labor productivity across sectors. However, individuals in nonagricultural self-employment work slightly more hours (47.6 ) than those in wage employment (46.7) (Figure1.12c). Among wage workers, it is individuals in the public sector who work less (41.4) than their counterparts in the private formal (45.8) or informal sectors (46.6) (Figure1.12d).

"The state of a person 's health is shaped not only by one 's access to health services , but by a multitude of factors , which are termed the "" determinants of health "" ."	"The World Health Organization (WHO) defines good health as a ""state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"".3 This recognition of mental and social well-being, in addition to physical well-being, is critical, and emphasizes the importance of viewing health holistically. The state of a person's health is shaped not only by one's access to health services, but by a multitude of factors, which are termed the ""determinants of health"". Figure 1 shows how the determinants of health can be applied to migrants across the migration cycle. Individual determinants are factors such as age, sex and genetic predisposition to disease, and the epidemiological profile of a given context and the disease exposures associated with it. Structural determinants are usually politically mediated - such as legal frameworks and societal attitudes towards migrants - and can result in a range of inequalities in socioeconomic status. For migrants, structural determinants of health include the conditions associated with the different phases of their migration journey - pre-migration, movement, arrival and integration, and (for some) return. 3 WHO, 1946. 212 Migration and health: Current issues, governance and knowledge gaps Fi gu re 1 .

Source: WorldBank Enterprise Survey and Coted'Ivoire's CdB. Data from WBES excludes 1 percent outliers. Coted'Ivoire 2012 does not follow standardized WBES methodology and calculations are not accounted for sampling design, hence need to be interpreted with caution. Monetary values are in 2010 U.S. dollar. Capital intensity is the value of capital stock (total fixed asset) per worker. Return to capital is value added/capital stock. Note (a): Small firms: exclude firms with fewer than five employees. (b) Returns to capital by firm size are not reported for Coted'Ivoire 2012 enterprise survey data due to small sample size. (c) Estimate using CdB data exclude micro firms and firms reporting zero capital to be comparable with the WBES. 103 See referenced data in http://www.doingbusiness.org/Custom-Query/cote-divoire and http://iab.worldbank.org/data/exploreeconomies/ cote-divoire#investing-across-sectors Capital constraint varies substantially by sectors and type of firms, indicating frictions in the capital market (Figures 5.24 and 5.25). Using the same average capital returns as a proxy, it appears that manufacturing and services industries associated with mining, computer and other equipment, and financial intermediation (ISIC 12, 30, 32, 33, 50, 67, and 72) are the most financially constrained. The agribusiness sector (ISIC 15), on the other hand, appears to be less constrained. Similarly, capital constraints also vary by firm size. In general, access to finance appears more binding for smaller firms. However, in contrast to suggestions from other studies, formal micro firms might not be the most financially constrained. Using our proxy, firms between 5-20 employees will benefit most from capital reallocation. Still, as Chapter4 highlights, capital constraints are also the most binding constraints for household enterprise.	Source: WorldBank Enterprise Survey and Coted'Ivoire's CdB.

"DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATION BUDGET INCREASE Overall, the most decisive factor in budget negotiations appears to be the endorsement of the highest-ranking political actors.

For example, in Liberia, in spite of the austere budget environment, the president and the government identified education as a priority sector. Thus, in 2016/17, while other sectors were subject to budget cuts, the education budget remained approximately stable, and projections suggest a progressive increase until 2020.

Moreover , Western Europe has the world 's highest-rated overall infrastructure and is one of the TTCI 's leading regions when it comes to cultural resources .	Subregion Analysis Western Europe improved its TTCI score over 2017, remaining the most competitive subregion in the world. It accounts for over one-half of Europe's T&T spending, nearly two-thirds of its domestic spending, and is the largest source of outbound international expenditure in the region. Consisting of most of Europe's largest and mostdeveloped economies, the subregion has an exceptional enabling environment, including Europe's highestperforming average business environment and strongest health and hygiene conditions, and ties with Northern Europe for the world's highest-scoring human resource and labour market. Moreover, Western Europe has the world's highest-rated overall infrastructure and is one of the TTCI's leading regions when it comes to cultural resources. Due to the maturity of its T&T economy, Western Europe experienced only slight increases or declines on most pillars. Yet the region's environmental sustainability improved substantially (a significant portion of this performance is due to a revised indicator for measuring fishing of overexploited or collapsed fish stocks), as did scores related to natural resources. The Price Competitiveness pillar was Western Europe's most enhanced, although the subregion remains the most expensive in Europe.

Over the period 1990- 2012, the global literacy rate for young women rose from 79 to 87 per cent and from 88 to 92 per cent for young men (figure 3.17). This reflects increased participation in formal schooling among younger generations. Youth literacy is almost universal in the more developed regions, in Eastern Asia and in the Caucasus and Central Asia; it is close to being universal in Latin America and in South-Eastern Asia. In parts of the world where many boys and girls do not attend school or drop out, youth literacy rates are much lower than global averages. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the rates are among the lowest in the world, only 64 per cent of young women and 76 per cent of young men are literate.

"To make the research easier and the data collection more effective both qualitative and quantitative analysis were applied. Thus, I have used mixed method research approach for data collection and analysis.

Mixed method helps to analyze data in all possible ways. It provides a broader perspective of the study and helps the researcher to assemble a deeper understanding of the fact of interest.

Environmental studies shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs .	Data and analysis can be used to identify misaligned incentives, indicated by a gap between the individual and the social value of jobs. Several research areas deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can measure the tax burden that applies to capital and labor and assess the crosssubsidization between individuals or firms. The methods of labor economics can uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings, or between the social and individual returns to schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on reducing poverty. Productivity studies allow for quantifying the spillovers from employment in foreign-owned investment companies, or in cities. Environmental studies shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs. And valA simple approach to setting policy priorities follows five steps (figure 19): * Step one: What are good jobs for development? Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities. The nature of those jobs varies with the characteristics of the country, including its phase of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges are not the same in agrarian economies, resource-rich countries, conflict-affected countries, or in countries with high youth unemployment. And the jobs with the greatest development impact differ as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. * Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under way, the development value of new manufacturing jobs might materialize. But it might not if, for example, inadequate urbanization policies limit the establishment of new firms.

Gender gaps in students ' performance were related to gender differences in attitudes towards reading .	Girls outperformed boys in reading skills in every country that participated in the 2012 PISA survey Results from the PISA 2012 reading assessment showed that girls outperformed boys in every participating country. The OECD average score for reading performance was 478 points for boys and 515 for girls (a gender gap of 38 score points, which is roughly equivalent to one year of schooling). Similarly, the non-OECD average showed a gap of 41 points to the advantage of girls. Gender gaps in students' performance were related to gender differences in attitudes towards reading. Fifteen-year-old girls were more likely to read for enjoyment and read complex works of fiction and non-fiction, whereas boys were more likely to read comic books, which could partly be the result of their weaker reading skills. Girls also tended to be more skilled in understanding, remembering and summarizing the material they read.c Boys did slightly better than girls in mathematics in most countries Performance in mathematics was also characterized by gender differences, which tended to be smaller and less systematic than those related to reading. Boys performed better in mathematics than girls in the majority of countries that participated in the PISA survey (52 out of 65 countries or areas). The average OECD score in mathematics was 499 for boys and 489 for girls (a 10-point gender gap), while for non-OECD countries or areas, the average score was 453 for boys versus 448 for girls (a 5-point gap). In contrast to what was observed for reading, the gender gaps were not significant in many countries. In 13 countries, the gender disparities were actually in the favour of girls, albeit the size of the gaps being small. Girls appear to be narrowing the gaps in achievement in mathematics where boys have historically held an advantage. Gender differences in science performance showed much narrower gaps than in mathematics and reading for most countries or areas--both OECD and non-OECD--and in most cases the gaps were not statistically significant.d a OECD, 2014. b Ibid. c Ibid. d Ibid.

The language used around COVID-19 measures is also pertinent; for example, Bangladesh is not using the words 'curfew' or 'lockdown' for fear of creating panic but there are 'stay at home' restrictions from 8pm to 8am and the nationwide lockdown was initially termed a 'general holiday'. This is in stark contrast to Cox's Bazar, where the government has been very direct in imposing a 'complete lockdown' with 'no entry, no exit - until the situation improves'.

WHR are apt for producers and traders of commodities that lack credit history or other collateral to access lending finance. The financial services provided by the system combine with other potential benefits, such as access to reliable storage and hence the possibility to sell the product over time, rather than solely at harvest periods, when prices of commodities may be especially low. 121. As such, WHR is especially advantageous for producers and traders of storable agricultural commodities such as grain, sunflower seeds and sugar. In these sectors, the use of stored commodities as collateral represents a solution to enhancing agricultural lending, and provides a valuable addition to the traditional use of real estate and land as loan collateral (Hollinger et al., 2009). For small producers, however, storage fees may be too high. This creates an incentive to pool commodities among small firms to access the WHR system (USAID, 2009).

Technical staff at the Beacon Foundation have been trained in research methods and maintenance of equipment. Field trials, surveys and workshops were conducted in 2002 and 2003. Field trials and workshops were held in 5 villages in 2004. The better farmers are being trained as trainers to impart knowledge to their peers. There has been a rapid shiftin training emphasis as the production has expanded. Leveraging this project the Beacon Foundation has initiated training of women's groups to process these peanuts and add value. Five village factories have been established. The technologies being promoted for production, processing, roasting and making peanut butter are labor intensive and will absorb the available labor in the region. While roasting, shelling and peanut butter making devices are available, they are undergoing continuous improvements, often with input from the locals. Processing technologies for new products yet to be selected will need to be developed and fitted to local circumstances and the peanut CRSP will be on hand to offer help in those transitions. Women have played a major role in the status of the project and will be a major force behind future success. They organized and led many of the workshops that we visited and were key players in generating questions and stimulating discussions. The demonstration exercise where we were introduced to the use of the shelling, roasting, de-skinning and peanut butter grinding technologies were run mainly by women. The making of the cassava bread which will also be sold in the school feeding program was demonstrated by women. Involvement of the youth participants appears to have been orchestrated by the women participants.

Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration. Some migration journeys are highly gendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity. Many other migrations, the majority, include both boys and girls, though sometimes in different ratios, depending on country of origin. Much child migration, particularly outside the context of conflict or disaster, is safe and undertaken as part of a family unit. However, there is an increasing tendency for children to be involved in migration that jeopardizes their safety and violates their rights. Examples of this type of migration include not only the obviously life-threatening forced migrations across treacherous routes - such as the Eastern and Central Mediterranean, where drownings are frequent - but also migrations where children are routinely exposed to physical and/or sexual violence. Unsafe migration also includes situations where children rely on exploitative intermediaries who take advantage of the need for migration assistance to extract labour or other types of services from children in their custody. The discussion focuses on these aspects of child migration.	Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration.

But given the often limited fiscal space and administrative capacity of developing countries , creating an enabling business environment across the board can be challenging , and the relevant question is how policy priorities should be set .	A targeted investment climate? The conventional wisdom is that a level playing field is preferable because governments do not have enough information to pick winners and targeting can be captured by interest groups. But given the often limited fiscal space and administrative capacity of developing countries, creating an enabling business environment across the board can be challenging, and the relevant question is how policy priorities should be set. The conventional wisdom views targeting with a skepticism that stems from failed experiences with industrial policy. However, targeting may not necessarily be aimed at industrial sectors. Supporting job creation in sectors with high rates of female employment, or productivity gains in smallholder farming, or more jobs connected to global value chains may have high development payoffs depending on country contexts.

It may be possible to evacuate from a cyclone, return home and continue with a livelihood such as fishing. When a livelihood is dependent on rain-fed agriculture, in situ adaptation may be more problematic when precipitation or access to water slowly decreases over time. As such mobility related to slow onset processes can take on a more permanent profile with related impacts on livelihoods, health and human rights. The longer lead time relative to sudden-onset hazards can also provide scope for all forms of adaptation, in situ and through mobility.

There are a number of points which are repeatedly raised as criticism of the Footprint method. One dimension that the Footprint doesn't have on its radar screen is the toxicity of materials. Why not? Environmental impacts can be divided into two large categories. One area concerns biocapacity questions, or questions of the human material metabolism or its throughput. This is the material exchange between people and nature. In this domain, we run up against quantitative limits. Examples are climate change, freshwater scarcity, or fisheries collapses for instance. The other area of concern is human health: unsafe or polluted environments become a threat to human health and wellbeing. Examples are air or water pollution or heavy metals in soils. This second domain has more of a qualitative dimension: small amounts of the wrong substances affect people's quality of life. Both these environmental impact dimensions are significant, but mixing them up would confuse us. Since they represent different dynamics, they need to be monitored and addressed separately. Therefore the Footprint, a measure of the first domain, needs to be complemented with measures for the second domain. In addition, ecological impact measures need to be accompanied by social and economic information.	Environmental impacts can be divided into two large categories.

"Mexico's human rights crisis continued, exacerbated by increases in violence and homicides, including a record number of killings of journalists. Arbitrary arrests and detentions remained widespread - often leading to further human rights violations, most of which were not properly investigated.

Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be widespread and were committed with impunity by the security forces, with people routinely forced to sign false ""confessions"". However, the Senate's approval of a new law on enforced disappearances - following a national public outcry over the case of 43 forcibly disappeared students whose fate and whereabouts remained undisclosed - was a potential step forward, although its eventual implementation will require serious political commitment to ensure justice, truth and reparations.

It is estimated that around 15 per cent of all pregnant women will develop complications during childbirth,111 often spontaneously without any previous existing conditions. In developing regions, the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel was 70 per cent in 2014, an increase of 13 percentage points since 1990 (table 2.5). Some developing regions show almost universal coverage for skilled attendance at birth, such as Eastern Asia and the Caucasus and Central Asia, at 100 per cent and 96 per cent, respectively. However, in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, only every other pregnant woman gives birth with adequate care.

Critical checkpoints for the industry Despite improvements across region, subregion and income level, a number of challenges remain for the T&T industry. First, given the forecasted growth in T&T in the coming decade, far more investment is required in infrastructure in order to build capacity to welcome more visitors while adequately serving the needs of citizens. For example, despite the growth in air travel and openness, global average perceptions of air transport infrastructure quality have improved at a far slower rate (at a global average 1.4% and 0.4% for high-income economies since the last report), and airport density statistics have fallen. In addition, while some progress has been made in improving ground and port infrastructure, especially in Asia-Pacific, the overall growth trend for Ground and Port Infrastructure (pillar 11) has been slower. Furthermore, from a global perspective, perceptions of the quality and efficiency of ground transport infrastructure and services have on average remained near stagnant. Consequently, the risk of future air and ground transport bottlenecks is likely to rise, hurting both the industry and local economies.

Odisha is one of India 's poorest states with high levels of food insecurity ( Pritchard et al. 2013 , Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation 2014 ) .	Enhancing rice farming resilience to climate hazards is an important objective. The challenge is amplified by the magnitude of climate hazard exposure in deltas, and the concentrations of poor households who practice rice cultivation in deltas. It is likely that climate change will increase the intensity and occurrence of climate hazards (Mathison et al. 2013). Without understanding how to build the resilience of rice farming in deltas, it is difficult to create effective long-term management plans for agricultural development, and to assess the consequences of future climate change on rice production, and on farmer livelihoods. Here, to address this issue, we use primary field data from the Mahanadi Delta in India to assess what factors explain rice farmer resilience to climate hazards. 1uwa School of Agriculture and Environment, University of Western Australia, 2Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, UK, 3Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, UK., 4Wageningen School of Social Sciences (Wass), Wageningen University and Research Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ in the Mahanadi Delta the majority of farmers are smallholders excluded from local Economic Growth (Ministry of Agriculture 2014a). Odisha is one of India's poorest states with high levels of food insecurity (Pritchard et al. 2013, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation 2014). Rice farmers are exposed to frequent climate hazards, typically tropical cyclones and floods alongside a diverse range of environmental, social, political, and economic stresses (Chhotray and Few 2012, Das 2012, Chhotray et al. 2013), making it relatively typical of developing country deltas. Rice farming in Odisha is pursued on its own, or as part of a mix of livelihood strategies under a range of owned land and share cropping arrangements. This context enables assessment of how climate hazards interact with different rice farming livelihood strategies to determine resilience.

Following Maxwell (1996) we classified coping strategies as those that do not enable accumulation of assets, preclude investment, or inhibit transformation of existing structural constraints to rice cropping (Maxwell 1996). Coping strategies are used when normal livelihood function supported by rice farming is not possible. The following coping strategies are used during cropping seasons that are not impacted by climate hazards: accessing the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)[7], selling household assets, migration, daily wage labor, and loan taking. These coping strategies are part of a low-productivity/low-income rice-based livelihood system. Following climate hazards two additional coping strategies were employed: (i) reducing levels of household food consumption and (ii) securing government relief (Table 5).

"Even with regular surveys on labour force and time use, accurate measurement of women's work remains a challenge. Work activities such as subsistence agriculture are often underestimated or excluded, for reasons such as limitation of data sources, gender-based stereotypes, and concepts and definitions adopted in data collection. ""Work activities"", which were re-defined by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 2013 to include all forms of work, including unpaid domestic and care work performed by women and girls in households, could help in better measuring and understanding the full range of work carried out by women (box 4.3). a The assessment of national capacity to produce the necessary data for gender analysis carried out in this section is only based on national data that were either reported to the international statistical system or accessible in national reports and databases.

There are many differences found in the ages and qualifications of private tutors. In many settings, secondary school students earn pocket money by tutoring primary school children, and similarly university students tutors secondary students. At other end of the age scale, many tutors are retirees who wish still to contribute to society and earn some extra money. Between these two extremes of age are others who provide tutoring on a full time or part time basis, and who may or may not have formal training. This picture contrasts with mainstream schooling, in which teachers are expected to be aged between 21 and 65 and to have formal training. (Bray, 2006, P.529).

Natural Resources ( 5 indicators ) : Countries with natural assets clearly have a competitive advantage in attracting tourists .	"The Natural and Cultural Resources subindex captures the principal ""reasons to travel"" and includes 2 pillars: 13. Natural Resources (5 indicators): Countries with natural assets clearly have a competitive advantage in attracting tourists. In this pillar we include a number of attractiveness measures, including the number of UNESCO natural World Heritage sites, a measure of the quality of the natural environment which proxies the beauty of its landscape, the richness of the fauna in the country as measured by the total known species of animals, and the percentage of nationally protected areas, which proxies the extent of national parks and nature reserves. 14. Cultural Resources and Business Travel (5 indicators): A country's cultural resources are another critical driver of T&T competitiveness. In this pillar we include the number of UNESCO cultural World Heritage sites, the number of large stadiums that can host significant sport or entertainment events, and a new measure of digital demand for cultural and entertainment--the number of online searches related to a country's cultural resources can allow the level of interest to be inferred. The number of international association meetings taking place in a country is included to capture, at least partially, business travel."

For rural households , nonagricultural activities represent a source of income diversification to mitigate harvest risks or seasonal variations , and often a pathway out of poverty .	There is a wide variety of informal nonagricultural self-employment activities in Coted'Ivoire, and many individuals choose to operate in the sector. From a legalistic standpoint, being informal means that the establishment (operating unit) or the employee is not registered. As in many countries in the region, the median owner of a nonagricultural microenterprise tends to be young females with no formal education. The majority of nonagricultural individual enterprises are in small-scale service activities, but these enterprises persist over time. In fact, in contrast to common perceptions, many individuals declare preferring self-employment over other types of occupations. A range of pull factors, including earning potentials, attract individuals into the sector. For rural households, nonagricultural activities represent a source of income diversification to mitigate harvest risks or seasonal variations, and often a pathway out of poverty. Still, as Chapter3 has highlighted, off-farm diversification remains limited in rural Coted'Ivoire and there might be scope to further encourage it.

TA B L E 6 .1 Projects in extractive industries are capital intensive and create few jobs Diverse jobs agendas 201 for some: each hard rock miner could earn the equivalent of US$50,000-$75,000 a year, and each alluvial miner could make around US$10,000 a year. This income became the main contribution to the local economy, together with remittances sent by those ex-Misima Mines Limited employees who found work in large mines elsewhere.44 And even in mining areas, social impacts are more mixed than the positive effect on living standards suggests. The influx of money from mining enclaves has enabled men to pay high prices for brides and marry multiple wives on an unprecedented scale, which might have contributed to a decline in women's status. Around Porgera Mine, the abandonment of older wives and the increasing number of women taken from other tribal groups are considered factors in the increased incidence of domestic violence and tension with neighboring groups. In Lihir, when groups of landowners received compensation and royalty payments, no women were given authority to control the accounts.45 In addition, children normally help out in artisanal and small-scale mines.

In Papua New Guinea, the number of grassroots alluvial miners is two to three times greater than the number of people working in the formal extractive industries sector, even if contractors and temporary workers are counted among the latter. Some of the large extractive projects, such as Ok Tedi Mine, happen to be in poor areas. Thus, the artisanal mining taking place around them helps spread the wealth.

The banking sector is composed of 16 private commercial banks and two public banks .	Ethiopia's investment code prohibits foreign investment in the financial service industry, including banking and insurance. Foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin who own bank shares, even if purchased while they were Ethiopian citizens, have been required to surrender their shares at par value. The banking sector is composed of 16 private commercial banks and two public banks. Financial transactions are predominately in cash. Ethiopia's Automatic Teller Machine network has expanded rapidly and has become accessible to customers of all banks and credit card holders, though there are frequent service interruptions due to the unreliable Internet network. In addition, agent-banking services tied to mobile phones have been introduced by several providers, and more than a million users of agent-banking services are registered. Few international banks maintain representative offices, and all trade financing must go through an Ethiopian bank. This creates significant challenges for foreign investors with offshore accounts. Following the 15 percent devaluation of the Ethiopian birr in 2017, NBE increased the minimum saving interest rate from five to seven percent, and limited the outstanding loan growth rate in commercial banks to 16.5 percent above the previous year. This has had the effect of limiting lending to business other than the export and manufacturing sectors. Moreover, banks are instructed to immediately transfer 30 percent of their foreign exchange inflow to an NBE account for local currency conversion. This hard currency is then used by the government to meet the strategic needs of the country, such as payments made to procure petroleum, fertilizers, or pharmaceuticals. 164 | foreign trade barriers .

"The impact of labor policies is often the subject of heated debates. In the past decade, improved data and methods have generated a great deal of new information not only in industrial countries but increasingly in developing countries as well. The analyses of these data have led to fresh insights. Estimated effects prove to be relatively modest in most cases--certainly more modest than the intensity of the debate would suggest. Excessive or insufficient interventions can certainly have detrimental effects on productivity. But in between these extremes lies a ""plateau"" where effects enhancing and undermining efficiency can be found side by side and most of the impact is redistributive. Overall, labor policies and institutions are neither the major obstacle nor the magic bullet for creating good jobs for development in most countries."

Ground and Port Infrastructure ( 7 indicators ) : The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T & T sector .	The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country. We measure the level of tourism service infrastructure through the number of hotel rooms complemented by the extent of access to services such as car rentals and ATMs.	Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector.

Figure1.6 summarizes the composition of employment in Coted'Ivoire in February 2014 based on these categories. As noted above, unemployment is relatively low, and so is the number of wage jobs in the economy. Only 22.8 percent of employed individuals hold wage jobs, mostly in nonagricultural wage jobs (19.9 percent).8 By contrast, 47.5 percent of the employed population is self-employed in agriculture, and 29.7 percent is self-employed in nonagricultural activities. Self-employed individuals do not operate in a formal 'labor market' for wage jobs. They mostly work for themselves and create their own jobs. Most adults work on family farms, or in nonagricultural individual enterprises selling goods or services in small-scale informal activities. While there is substantial variation within these employment sectors (including in agricultural and nonagricultural microenterprises), on average these occupations tends to have low productivity.

Strengthen linkages with extension service providers for wider public dissemination of information and to strengthen linkage of markets (traders/processors) with peanut producers (farmers).

This would necessitate a strong technology transfer component of the ongoing/new projects that should include training of key stakeholders. In some cases, a new institutional arrangement would be needed with new partners besides the current collaborating research institution to enlist support from a food science group.

There are a number of points which are repeatedly raised as criticism of the Footprint method. One dimension that the Footprint doesn't have on its radar screen is the toxicity of materials. Why not? Environmental impacts can be divided into two large categories. One area concerns biocapacity questions, or questions of the human material metabolism or its throughput. This is the material exchange between people and nature. In this domain, we run up against quantitative limits. Examples are climate change, freshwater scarcity, or fisheries collapses for instance. The other area of concern is human health: unsafe or polluted environments become a threat to human health and wellbeing. Examples are air or water pollution or heavy metals in soils. This second domain has more of a qualitative dimension: small amounts of the wrong substances affect people's quality of life. Both these environmental impact dimensions are significant, but mixing them up would confuse us. Since they represent different dynamics, they need to be monitored and addressed separately. Therefore the Footprint, a measure of the first domain, needs to be complemented with measures for the second domain. In addition, ecological impact measures need to be accompanied by social and economic information.	This is the material exchange between people and nature.

The answer is usually ""no"" because 95 percent of all items exported from the United States to a foreign buyer don't require an export license, even though the items are subject to U.S. government export control laws and regulations. These laws and regulations determine whether you can sell your product to an international buyer, which countries you can export it to, and to which buyers you can sell.

"As was stated in Lhate ( Chokwe ) , "" we are all the same family , same culture and tradition ."	"In the isolated rural areas of Mozambique, the interior of Chokwe and Inhambane, the delivery mechanisms for the interventions were accepted by the communities, and generally consisted of local authorities, traditional leaders and external agencies working together to distribute goods and direct interventions. However, in the more densely populated areas, on the main roads (Chokwe and Marracuene) there was less trust within the communities and between the communities and the local government representatives. People complained of a lack of coordinated responses and suspected corruption. The differences may be attributed to the relative complexity of the livelihoods and livelihood strategies in the different areas and the breakdown of traditional trust bonds in the more urban influenced areas. In the remote rural areas the communities necessarily rely on one another socially and economically, and livelihood strategies are relatively less complex. Households in these communities generally know about the livelihoods of the different families in the community and are easily able to identify the richer and poorer members of the community. As was stated in Lhate (Chokwe), ""we are all the same family, same culture and tradition."" Local leaders in this situation are bound by strong ties to the community, creating, in general, higher degrees of trust. However, in the more densely populated areas (usually closer to cities) this homogeneity is not apparent. Households have more diverse livelihood strategies, including trading, and the communities are not as stable. The local leaders are often secluded from the households and are treated with suspicion. Unclear delivery processes and communities' lack of information can lead to distrust and the community feeling as if it were not included in the decision making process. A community member in Chokwe stated, ""We just see construction material passing us by, to and fro, to and fro, and never staying with us, it seems to stop in one of the homes of the leaders, who knows!"""

Migration can offer an empowering opportunity for women and men seeking better education, job opportunities and improved living conditions. Gender roles and attitudes acquired in the country of origin are often challenged and changed among migrants as they integrate into new communities. Such roles and attitudes may also shiftin the families and communities left behind.21 Women migrants in particular may become more empowered as they learn a new language and skills, take paid employment that secures their access to financial resources, and become familiar with new norms regarding women's rights and opportunities. Women left at home as their husbands migrate may also experience changes in their roles and assume greater decision-making power and autonomy.22 21 United Nations, 2006. 22 ibid.

It is about priorities and , ultimately , about questions of how to live well .	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where. This view of the world has proven to be sufficient for raising central questions and sparking the conversations that are needed to reverse current trends.

The second study was undertaken to test humans for responses to exposure to NS clay without the exposure to aflatoxin. The information gained from this study, coupled with the chronic and sub-chronic toxicity studies in rats will serve as the basis for use of NS clay in long-term human intervention trials in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis in Ghana. A randomized and double-blinded phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine the safety and tolerance of NS clay in humans and establish dosimetry protocols for long-term efficacy studies. Volunteers (20 - 45 yr in age), were clinically screened for confirmation of their health status. Fifty subjects (23 males and 27 females) were randomly divided into two groups: the low-dose group received six capsules containing 1.5 g/day, and the high-dose group Project TAM50 - 145 - received 6 capsules containing 3.0 g/day for a period of two weeks. NS clay capsules were distributed to each participant three times a day at designated sites. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after the study for laboratory analysis. Each participant completed the trial and compliance was 99.1%. All laboratory analyses, including hematology, minerals, vitamins A and E, and concentrations of selected electrolytes have been completed. Clinical and sub-clinical analyses, before and after NS clay exposure, have also been evaluated. The study examined in great detail the consequences of exposure to NS clay and found no evidence of increased risk. Thus the project can move on to the next phase which is to gain further data on human safety, and to test efficacy of NS clay in naturally exposed people in Ghana.

Part 2 Ecological accounting under the glass dome. Only sunlight has access to the futuristic city. With the sunshine a certain amount of energy enters - which is all there is to power the city. Though hypothetical, this approach somewhat reflects that of the Footprint. How large must the glass dome be - how much farm land, how many forests and other areas must it encompass for the city to be viable? Of course one can't simply imagine each city in isolation. The areas from which urban centers import their resources are distributed across large parts of the world, and, in times of globalization, cities compete for the global supply of natural capital. A city which provides a comparable quality of life with a smaller per capita Footprint is also less dependent upon imports, and therefore more competitive. If today the majority of people live in cities, then that is exactly where the future of civilization will be decided. The Footprint helps in adjusting infrastructure and urban planning for the future. Take traffic for example. As complex as discussions are about transportation and infrastructure, the Footprint can reduce the information to a single number each time: the required area. This is crucial when making investment decisions, be it for building roads, tracks, bridges, harbors or entire settlements. Infrastructure and planning decisions will shape the way residents live for years to come; the Footprint can help decision-makers balance the needs of citizens with a growing concern about the city's use of natural resources.

Resource-rich countries face similar pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and the commodity booms of the last few years have only made these pressures stronger. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance are needed to jump-start development, cope with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact on export diversification.77 An enabling business environment. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase, is the top constraint in low-and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets have the potential to allocate resources toward more productive uses, thwart the channeling of resources to those with political connections or economic power, and expand financial in- those jobs. If this is the case, policies should remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily removed, offsetting them may be an option, but the costs and benefits of doing so need to be carefully assessed.

Most mandate that a shareholder must immediately disclose transactions--as well as any conflicts of interest--to other shareholders. To date, no economy has reached the best regulatory performance on all indicators; every economy can progress further by learning from the experience of others.

This approach focuses on identifying activities that may hold latent comparative advantage and on removing the constraints that dissuade private firms from taking up these activities. In fact, there are many informal industrial clusters in urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. They produce garments, leather shoes, simple metal products, and furniture, among other things, though seldom for export.17 These clusters have spontaneously developed, suggesting a potential comparative advantage in these industries. Reducing logistics costs, removing red tape, and addressing coordination issues could create the necessary conditions to attract foreign investors to these clusters, especially at a time when wage increases in coastal China are encouraging the relocation of some industries where low labor costs are a key competitive factor (box 6.1).18 Jobs, which start to trigger agglomeration effects and make connections to the global economy, are good jobs for development in agrarian countries. To create more of these jobs and become centers of economic dynamism, cities need to be more functional. But even in the most optimistic scenario, it will take time to complete the urbanization process, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority for reducing the high poverty levels.

"The scholarly dissemination system rotates around a well-established gravitational centre: publication, with some forms of publication (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than others (and within that, individual academic publishers have different standings). Publishing the results of research in academic journals is without any doubt the paramount objective of today's scholars.1 Journals alone constitute about 40 per cent (books 16%) of the revenues of the broader scientific, technical and medical publisher's market, the size of which has been estimated at USD 25.2 billion in 2013.2 Through academic publishing, scholars formally share their findings within the scientific community. This exchange enables other researchers to learn about the latest advancements, to design new studies for filling current knowledge gaps, to compare their findings with the ones of their peers and perhaps to avoid reinventing the wheel. Moreover, publication constitutes ""...a permanent record of what has been discovered, when and by whom - like a court register for science"".3 The world's first academic journal - Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society - appeared as early as of 1665, as an expression of the Royal Society's policy of promoting the progress of science through open sharing of results and ideas supported by empirical evidence. Since then, the number of active scholarly peer-reviewed English language journals had reached 28,100 in 2014,4 and it has been calculated that the global scientific output doubles every nine years.5 Many scholars today are overwhelmed by the mass of academic literature, and it is becoming impossible to find the time to read every piece of literature, even on the narrowest topic."

Jobs are transformational PART1 Introduction to Part 1 Economic development is about improvements in living standards supported by productivity growth. It also involves social change associated with urbanization, integration in the world economy, and the drive toward gender equality. All of these transformations are related to jobs. The development process is about some jobs becoming better and others disappearing, about people taking jobs and changing jobs, and about jobs migrating to other places within and across countries. Development often entails the movement of labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly subsistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and mostly market-oriented activities. This movement transforms the lives of families and communities, the organization of firms, and the norms and values of societies. It can boost productivity and improve living standards and also affect the cohesiveness of society.

Tree waste fuels the development's cogeneration plant to provide district heating and electricity. Energy-efficient - The houses face south for * maximum solar gain, are triple-glazed, and have high-thermal insulation. Water-efficient - Most rain water falling on * the site is collected and reused. Appliances are water-efficient and use recycled water when possible. Low-impact materials - Building * materials were selected from renewable or recycled sources within 35 miles of the site, to minimize the energy required for transportation. Waste recycling - Refuse-collection facilities * are designed to support recycling. Transport - The development works in part-* nership with the United Kingdom's leading car-sharing operator, City Car Club.

"Part 2 Ecological accounting What can the Footprint tell us about the condition of Earth as a whole? Does it take a position on global questions of justice? Does the indicator convey underlying messages for highincome and low-income countries? As mentioned, humanity probably first went into overshoot in the 1980s. Before that time, the global community consumed resources and produced carbon dioxide at a rate consistent with what the planet could produce and reabsorb. By the mid 1990's humanity was already using approximately 15 percent more resources in a year than the planet could supply. The following tables and country comparisons reference the timeframe 1961-2005.

This section puts more structure into the descriptive analysis in section 5.3 by regressing firm-level employment growth - - in continuing firms - - on firm characteristics , productivity , and other sector-level controls in both OLS and FE regressions ( see Table in AnnexD for the specifications and associated results ) .	For surviving firms, employment growth significantly decreases with size. We have seen earlier that job creation is highest among young and small firms. This section puts more structure into the descriptive analysis in section 5.3 by regressing firm-level employment growth --in continuing firms --on firm characteristics, productivity, and other sector-level controls in both OLS and FE regressions (see Table in AnnexD for the specifications and associated results). While not reported here, the OLS results in column (3) show that once size and other firm characteristics are controlled for, the age effect is only significant for firms older than 25 years. This result is consistent with the finding that only a small portion of young firms are able to grow, which on average might result in similar growth rates among different age groups. It suggests that much of the positive growth-age relationship seems to be driven by size: along the size distribution, smaller firms appear to growth faster. Beyond size and age, firm-level productivity has a positive effect on post-entry growth. This relationship between employment growth and productivity is another useful indicator for market allocative efficiency as in a competitive market, productive firms should be able to grow while unproductive firms contract and exit (see for example, the discussion in Syverson 2011). The OLS estimates on labor productivity show a positive but weak within-sector correlation where a doubling of labor productivity is associated with an average of only 4-5 percent increase in employment growth. The FE coefficient estimates are higher. While the magnitude of the effect is still small, it suggests that when firms improve productivity, they manage to increase the labor force at the same time instead of shedding labor. However, as mentioned above, our productivity measures revenue productivity hence increases in productivity will partially capture increases infirm's demand. Therefore, our results could also be interpreted as firms facing higher demand are more likely to grow.

Under this system, eight years of primary schooling (leading to the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education) are followed by four years of secondary schooling (leading to the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)) and four years of first degree studies at university. This scheme replaces one which was based on the English pattern culminating in A levels and a three-year first degree course. The introduction of the 8-4-4 education system has led to tremendous changes in the secondary school curriculum. This is in line with the need for a broad-based curriculum that prepares students for self-reliance, vocational training and further education. In 1990, the first KCSE students entered university to begin four years of study for a general degree. The KCSE is administered by the Kenya National Examinations Council.

Also, the use of hired and unpaid labor is only expressed in number of persons used, not in number of person days. Nonetheless, the number of unpaid persons used on the farm suggests that labor exchange (unpaid non-household members working on the farm) is non-negligible (and almost on par with hired labor use), suggesting that it is important to keep it in mind when calculating labor productivity measures, albeit less so from the perspective of jobs generation.

The EEP determined that these goals, which continued from Phase 1 of the program, have been achieved in a satisfactory manner. The goals of the Peanut CRSP in Phase 2 (2001- 2005) are: (1) to enhance the peanut research capabilities of developing countries and the United States (U.S.A.), and (2) to focus this increased capability on development of technology that will help remove constraints limiting sustainable production and utilization. The Peanut CRSP goals and projects remain relevant to the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) agricultural strategy and its four development goals, and are contributing to their attainment in a positive way. The Peanut CRSP goals were directly relevant to three of the four themes of the USAID's program at the initiation of this phase which were: (1) economic growth, (2), environmental sustainability, (3) health and population, and (4) democracy. In 2004, USAID has made agricultural development a strategic priority focusing on increasing access to markets and smallholder participation in markets, which are also existing priorities for the Peanut CRSP.

Tobacco production and greenhouse gases Indirect effects of tobacco production include greenhouse gas emissions related to deforestation and the change to agricultural land use (10). Between 1908 and 2000, crops such as tobacco and maize replaced 74% of forest cover (2.8 million ha) in eastern Tanzania (66). In Zimbabwe and other major tobacco-growing countries, notably China, a growing trend among some farmers to use coal instead of wood for curing has helped limit deforestation but does nothing to alleviate climate change problems (34). 8/ To b a c c o a n d i t s e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t : a n o v e r v i e w Overall, tobacco cultivation and curing are part of one of the most environmentally destructive agricultural practices in low-and middle-income countries (62, 67). Yet production in many of these countries has increased over time. Although tobacco growing may bring some economic benefits to farmers and local communities, these are offset by adverse environmental and economic impacts associated with loss of precious resources such as forests, plants and animal species, and ill health among farmers handling chemicals involved in the process. Due to shifts in production and land availability, this impact increasingly falls on low-and middle-income countries. Worst of all, the majority of these developments are largely irreversible.

Similarly , several authors adopted a comparative perspective to illuminate the commonalities between histories , rationales , and implementation of criminalizing policies in different jurisdictions .	The IJMBS contributions typically dealt with the current global and national contexts where migrants' mobility has been constrained by restrictive measures. States have resorted to the criminalisation of migration or crimmigration to deter and to punish asylum seekers and irregular migrants. The process involves an increased reliance on the criminal law to enforce im migration statutes. Violations of immigration law carry criminal consequences without the implementation of procedural protections applicable to criminal law. Problematic measures include arbitrary detentions, enhanced surveillance practices, interception strategies and deportations. States have also tightened the criteria for granting refugee status with a view to limiting the number of persons granted asylum with the pretext of deterring 'abuse'. Against this background, IJMBS explored important theoretical and empirical implications associated with crimmigration and how this phenomenon is constructed and challenged in diverse settings. To illustrate, a historical lens was used in a contribution to examine the ideological roots pertaining to the Belgian policy of migrants' deportation. Such an approach demonstrated how framing the foreigner as an unethical subject legitimised the exceptional power of deportation. Similarly, several authors adopted a comparative perspective to illuminate the commonalities between histories, rationales, and implementation of criminalizing policies in different jurisdictions. One such example is the safe country of origin criteria used in refugee status determination both in the European Union (EU) and in Canada as a tool to delegitimize certain refugee claims and to reduce the number of 'undesirable' asylum seekers.

They help spread key messages focusing on hygiene and infection prevention , including handwashing using soap , social distancing , and how to benefit from the Koran when in lockdown at home .	The most comprehensive approach, at least on paper, is in Bangladesh, where the response plan underscores the roles of a range of actors - including key influencers at national and local level (community leaders, religious leaders, health workers, community volunteers, etc.) and local networks (women's groups, youth groups, business groups, traditional healers, etc.) - particularly on communication of key messages, with the need to 'speak with one voice' to avoid panic. (c) Maintains 42 The role of religious leaders has been important and varied, with a very positive role played by them in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda. In Uganda, religious leaders have actively supported the government's lockdown, banning church and mosque gatherings for a month and instead providing services over the radio. The situation is similar in Kenya, where Muslim leaders are actively supporting the response - even by shutting Nairobi's biggest mosque, Jamia Mosque, during Ramadan, the first time it has been shut in the 95 years of the mosque's history - and establishing guidelines on safe burials (WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), 2020). In Bangladesh, about 500,000 Imams and religious leaders are disseminating information about COVID-19 nationwide. They help spread key messages focusing on hygiene and infection prevention, including handwashing using soap, social distancing, and how to benefit from the Koran when in lockdown at home. This is particularly important in rural and hard-to-reach areas where people do not have access to radio, television, or newspapers, so the mosque megaphone can play a critically important role (UNICEF, 2020).

Additionally, the MOU facilitates bilateral cooperation in which the United States supports, as appropriate, Paraguay's efforts to strengthen the legal protection and enforcement of IPR. The National Directorate of Intellectual Property continues to improve administrative activities and some enforcement efforts, but other issues continue to plague the market for U.S. firms that rely on IPR protection. For example, U.S. firms remain concerned about the lack of coordinated enforcement against piracy and counterfeiting under the criminal code, particularly in Ciudad del Este. Other concerns include: (1) judicial inefficiency and delays in IPR cases; (2) lack of protection against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of, and reliance on, undisclosed test or other data submitted to the government by agrochemical or pharmaceutical companies for marketing approval; (3) the reported use of unlicensed software by offices within the Paraguayan government; and (4) the theft of pay television signals and related trafficking of satellite decoder devices.	For example, U.S. firms remain concerned about the lack of coordinated enforcement against piracy and counterfeiting under the criminal code, particularly in Ciudad del Este.

In this chapter , the terms nonagricultural self-employment , nonagricultural household enterprises , nonagricultural microenterprises , or simply household enterprises are used interchangeably .	Almost all nonagricultural household enterprises are in the informal sector, and their legal status is fuzzy. In the Ivorian legal framework, microenterprises are defined as having a maximum of 10 permanent employees, with an annual turnover (after taxes) up to CFAF 30 million, and doing some form of simplified accounting. Nonagricultural household enterprises are in this sense also microenterprises. However, an important caveat is that most independent activities are not registered and do not hold any form of accounting.73 As such, household enterprises operate at the margin of current laws on small-medium enterprises in the country.

First , continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice , cotton , and cashews could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops .	Several policy entry points can be considered to maximize agriculture's contribution to the jobs agenda in Coted'Ivoire. First, continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Second, smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation, in particular as there are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones. There is substantial scope for modernization to take place in smallholder agriculture, including through mechanization. Third, Coted'Ivoire would need strong additional investments in agricultural research and development, including on staple crops. Fourth, low educational levels and poor training among actors in agricultural value chains hold technological innovation back. Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities. Finally, improving rural land tenure security and overcoming financing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses. This will often require a more integrated value chain approach where the government can play an important coordinating role.

As such, WHR is especially advantageous for producers and traders of storable agricultural commodities such as grain, sunflower seeds and sugar. In these sectors, the use of stored commodities as collateral represents a solution to enhancing agricultural lending, and provides a valuable addition to the traditional use of real estate and land as loan collateral (Hollinger et al., 2009).

This approach focuses on identifying activities that may hold latent comparative advantage and on removing the constraints that dissuade private firms from taking up these activities. In fact, there are many informal industrial clusters in urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. They produce garments, leather shoes, simple metal products, and furniture, among other things, though seldom for export.17 These clusters have spontaneously developed, suggesting a potential comparative advantage in these industries. Reducing logistics costs, removing red tape, and addressing coordination issues could create the necessary conditions to attract foreign investors to these clusters, especially at a time when wage increases in coastal China are encouraging the relocation of some industries where low labor costs are a key competitive factor (box 6.1).18 Jobs, which start to trigger agglomeration effects and make connections to the global economy, are good jobs for development in agrarian countries. To create more of these jobs and become centers of economic dynamism, cities need to be more functional. But even in the most optimistic scenario, it will take time to complete the urbanization process, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority for reducing the high poverty levels.

While all food and agricultural products are subject to this policy , beef , pork , and dairy products are particularly targeted .	Enacted in June 2013, COMEX Resolution 102 and MAG Resolution 299-A imposed a mandatory, cumbersome process for allocating import licenses for 55 agriculture tariff lines including dairy, potatoes (including French fries), beef, pork, chicken, turkey, beans, sorghum, and corn. In November 2015, Ecuador replaced Resolution 299-A with Resolution 316, a more burdensome framework. Under Resolution 316, MAG's Undersecretary of Commercialization is vested with full authority to decide and administer the granting of non-automatic import licenses. After consulting with domestic producers, MAG allocates single import licenses on a per-shipment basis. In addition, some processed products which previously did not require a sanitary permit from Ecuador's SPS agency AGROCALIDAD, are subject to such unnecessary requirements. The United States has raised questions about these measures in light of Ecuador's WTO obligations. Industry stakeholders report that the process for obtaining import permits is deliberately trade restrictive. A non-automatic issuance policy has been implemented that, due to the difficultly of obtaining import permits, incentivizes domestic sourcing of products at the expense of imported products. While all food and agricultural products are subject to this policy, beef, pork, and dairy products are particularly targeted. For these products, an importer's total import allowance cannot surpass an amount determined by MAG. For dairy products, MAG also requires that interested parties provide sales and consumption forecasts before it will authorize imports. The United States has expressed concern regarding Ecuador's import licensing process in light of the WTO Import Licensing Agreement.

Educational differences can be viewed as a proxy for differences in earning power , which influences bargaining power ( for example , Sen 1989 ) .	It has been well documented (for example, Klasen and Lamanna 2008; World Bank 2011) that gender inequalities at the societal or aggregate level impose societal costs in forgone growth in per capita incomes. A number of indexes also measure gender inequality at the societal level (for example, the Global Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum [Hausmann, Tyson, and Zahidi 2011], the Gender Inequality Index produced by the United Nations Development Programme as part of the Human Development Report [hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/gii/], and the Social Institutions and Gender Index of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [Branisa, Klasen, and Ziegler 2009]). Why, then, do we need to look at intrahousehold gender inequality? A large body of evidence now demonstrates that failing to pay attention to intrahousehold gender inequality has costs for attaining development objectives (see Alderman et al. 1995; Haddad, Hoddinott, and Alderman 1997; Quisumbing 2003). Studies on child nutritional status (Smith et al. 2003) and child schooling (Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003) use indicators of differences in age, education, and assets at marriage between the husband and wife within the same household as indicators of intrahousehold bargaining. Husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981, cited in Quisumbing and Hallman 2005). Educational differences can be viewed as a proxy for differences in earning power, which influences bargaining power (for example, Sen 1989). For example, Smith et al. (2003) base their measure of women's decision-making power relative to their male partners (usually their husbands) on four underlying indicators: whether a woman works for cash, her age at first marriage, the age difference between her and her husband, and the educational difference between her and her husband.

An effective health system response requires sufficient supplies, logistics, equipment, and infrastructure, with emergency stocks, procurement plans, and plans to weather interruptions in critical infrastructure and transportation. For COVID-19, it is imperative that essential equipment, drugs, reagents, and supplies such as PPE have been stockpiled and prepositioned to optimise surge capacity. All COVID-19 healthcare facilities need continued access to essential equipment, drugs, reagents, and supplies, including PPE and respiratory support, in accordance with their designated level of care. High-dependency care capacity needs to be augmented in anticipation of demand, backed by appropriate case referral protocols. 46 While there does seem to be an upward trend in the use of this 117 number, the hotline still only receives about 20 COVID-19 related calls per day (data from Ministry of Health and Sanitation, 2020b).

This reflects the global trend, with international markets unable to meet the unforeseen and rapidly increasing demand, particularly with the prolonged shutdown of production facilities in mainland China. When governments have to procure supplies themselves, they are fully exposed to international market forces. In some cases, international donors assist and organise procurement. Donor procurement facilitates bulk purchase by the respective partner and allows government agencies to deploy valuable human resources elsewhere.

"Beneficiaries continue to be victims of a lack of information about issues that concern them and their families. The situation is tolerated as people have very low expectations and very little awareness of possible rights to information. Communities were never informed about the amount of money offered to their communities and were rarely informed about what they could expect to receive. The lack of information causes passivity and a lack of critical faculties in the recipients; they are grateful but not sure whether they have received all that is available. For example people were often called to meeting to be counted and put on lists, but not told what for; there were whisper campaigns in Chokwe about the distribution of money that are still carrying on two years after the distribution. Nobody in the communities visited was aware of the full picture. The lack of information led to a sense of powerlessness and dependency. The problem originates in the lack of transparency from all the agencies involved, both government and NGOs. NGOs do not generally reveal their budgets to the local government; the local government does not share financial information with the NGOs; the central government does not reveal the amounts sent to the local government; and, nobody tells the recipients about the possible goods and funds that may be available. Beneficiaries are generally asked to make a shopping list without knowing the amount that can be spent or the range of goods available. The weight of power over information rests squarely with the ""giver"" and not the ""receiver."" Participation remains in its infancy and generally consists of providing a basis to build participation in committees and compliance with a set of rules decided by external agents. For wider participation to take place all the elements involved in decision-making need to strive towards power sharing, including sharing of responsibilities, information, and resources.

Leveraging this project the Beacon Foundation has initiated training of women's groups to process these peanuts and add value. Five village factories have been established. The technologies being promoted for production, processing, roasting and making peanut butter are labor intensive and will absorb the available labor in the region. While roasting, shelling and peanut butter making devices are available, they are undergoing continuous improvements, often with input from the locals. Processing technologies for new products yet to be selected will need to be developed and fitted to local circumstances and the peanut CRSP will be on hand to offer help in those transitions.

The Prime Minister criticized the Chief Justice after the ruling.Subsequently in November, Chief Justice Sinha resigned from his post and left the country under circumstances that indicated executive interference following the 16th Amendment decision.

Climate hazards , such as the floods in 2008 and Cyclone Phailin interact with this livelihood-farming system to amplify vulnerabilities and limit opportunities for improved rice cropping .	Rice farming is precarious; it does not generate resources to allow farmers to effectively respond to climate hazards and necessitates a range of coping strategies to sustain livelihoods. Climate hazards, such as the floods in 2008 and Cyclone Phailin interact with this livelihood-farming system to amplify vulnerabilities and limit opportunities for improved rice cropping. For example, many farmers are dependent upon loans to support subsistence rice farming, and rice farming does not generate returns to pay back loans. To be able to repay loans, to obtain credit for the following season, households often sold small portions of their harvest, which was already insufficient, used remittances if available, or sought daily wage labor[11]. Remittances did not provide an income flow to stimulate growth of climate resilient and productive rice cropping. Remittances from high-skilled migrants were rarely invested to increase returns from rice cropping but more often spent on building large concrete (pukka) homes. Remittances from low-skilled migrants were not of sufficient quantity to facilitate investment to boost rice cropping; these remittances just covered immediate household needs in normal times.

Some of the challenges facing women and women 's organizations seeking to be part of humanitarian action at the local and national levels result from constraining sociocultural norms .	"Some of the challenges facing women and women's organizations seeking to be part of humanitarian action at the local and national levels result from constraining sociocultural norms. These norms feed into an idea that ""women are not capable to be leaders"" (Lindley-Jones 2018, 6). In addition, right-wing movements around the world are strongly pushing back against women's rights and gender justice, impeding women and women's organizations from engaging in decision-making spaces. According to a report from CIVICUS, women's rights groups were the most commonly threatened group in the civil rights sphere (2018, 9). The dangers of a backlash are real. Women's organizations that seek to advance gender equality and challenge gender norms will, by the nature of their mission, come into conflict with powerholders who do not want to share or lose the influence they have (Esplen 2013). In a survey on community decision-making on preparedness in Pakistan, several study participants expressed concern about a backlash from men if women were to engage more in public spaces, suggesting instead ""that women in conservative communities might need to request permission from their male counterparts in order to participate in public decision-making spaces"" (Van Brabant and Patel 2018, 26). These barriers to participation grow from a patriarchal terrain that has consistently devalued and discouraged women's voice and agency, particularly in public spaces."

Labor economics , productivity studies , and other social sciences have developed analytical tools for the analyses required .	The tools of public finance can be used to assess gaps between the individual and the social values of jobs in the case of jobs supported through transfers. Taxation and government spending affect earnings and modify incentives and thus have an impact on resource allocations, including employment. Analyses of the tax burden applying to capital and labor, assessments of cross-subsidization between individuals or firms, or evaluations of the impacts of payroll this amounts to identifying the gaps between the individual and the social values of jobs (if any) that are relevant in a particular country context. Such an evaluation requires data, some of which many countries are now collecting on a more or less regular basis (box 5.5). Using data to measure the full social value of a job calls for rigorous analysis too. Patterns in the data may result from spurious correlations, and the related conclusions may be tainted if individuals and firms with fundamentally different characteristics selected themselves into specific jobs or activities. Labor economics, productivity studies, and other social sciences have developed analytical tools for the analyses required. Sociological and anthropological methods can provide texture and context missing in quantitative data. In some cases, randomized trials or natural experiments can shed light on the mechanisms at play. But methodological pitfalls abound, so the safest approach is to triangulate the available evidence.

Engage persons with disabilities and organizations of persons with disabilities in such outreach activities. These campaigns should focus on raising awareness among the population on the needs and abilities of persons with disabilities. 3) Develop mechanisms for reporting on discrimination. Approaches to developing such mechanisms include the creation of a public service, where persons with disabilities can file or report incidences of discrimination, or the carrying out of periodic surveys and collection of feedback from persons with disabilities regarding how anti-discriminatory laws are being implemented in practical terms. Reducing inequalities through enhanced access to assistive technology for persons with disabilities This section focuses on access to assistive technology507 for persons with disabilities, a precondition for reducing inequalities between persons with and without disabilities and therefore for achieving Goal 10. Assistive products include devices, equipment, instruments and software whose primary purpose is to maintain or improve an individual's functioning and independence, and thereby promote their well-being.508 They can enhance an individual's performance, 509 and enable people to live healthy, productive, independent and dignified lives.508 The absence of effective assistive products can undermine the ability of persons with disabilities to fully participate in society.510 Enhancing access at an affordable cost is therefore fundamental if no one is to be leftbehind.511 The section presents the international normative framework on assistive technology and continues with an overview of unmet needs for assistive technology.

This inverse relationship between farm size and productivity was first observed in South Asia.27 But it has also emerged in Sub-Saharan Africa as population pressure on the land has led to agricultural intensification. In Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, a 1 percent increase in farm size is associated with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent reduction in yield.28 The use of family labor per hectare is also inversely correlated with farm size.29 The relationship between crop yields and farm size emerges, because the larger, more mechanized farms have higher productivity.

Even in Eastern European countries, where private sector entry is only two decades old, microenterprises account for 10 to 20 percent of employment in manufacturing and for 30 to 50 percent of employment in services. Micro-and small enterprises also play a critical role in job creation and destruction (box 3.2).26 In farms, uneven technological progress It is generally assumed that large farms are more productive. In low-income countries, however, In some household and labor force surveys, employees are asked to report the size of the firm they work for, or the size of their own business if they are self-employed.

International Openness ( 3 indicators ) : Developing a competitive T & T sector internationally requires a certain degree of openness and travel facilitation .	The T&T Policy and Enabling Conditions subindex captures specific policies or strategic aspects that impact the T&T industry more directly and includes 4 pillars: 6. Prioritization of Travel and Tourism (6 indicators): The extent to which the government prioritizes the T&T sector has an important impact on T&T competitiveness. By making clear that the sector is of primary concern, the government can channel funds to essential development projects and coordinate the actors and resources necessary to develop the sector. Signalling the stability of government policy can affect the sector's ability to attract further private investment. The government can also play an important role in directly attracting tourists through national marketing campaigns. This pillar includes measures of government spending, effectiveness of marketing campaigns and country branding, and the completeness and timeliness of providing T&T data to international organizations, as this indicates the importance that a country assigns to its T&T sector. 7. International Openness (3 indicators): Developing a competitive T&T sector internationally requires a certain degree of openness and travel facilitation. Restrictive policies such as cumbersome visa requirements diminish tourists' willingness to visit a country, and indirectly reduce the availability of key services. Components measured in this pillar include the openness of the bilateral air service agreements which the government has entered, which impacts the availability of air connections to the country, and the number of regional trade agreements in force, which proxies the extent to which it is possible to provide world class tourism services. 8. Price Competitiveness (4 indicators): Lower costs related to travel in a country increase its attractiveness for many travellers as well as for investing in the T&T sector. Among the aspects of price competitiveness taken into account in this pillar are airfare ticket taxes and airport charges, which can make flight tickets much more expensive; the relative cost of hotel accommodation; the cost of living, proxied by purchasing power parity; and fuel price costs, which directly influence the cost of travel.

Different market solutions ( such as machinery services ) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization .	Mechanization remains limited. As urban and rural wages increase, pressures to mechanize will increase. This does not necessarily imply large-scale farming. Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization. They have been deployed successfully, most recently also in China, where land endowments are multiple times smaller.69 While not acute, the need for supporting smallholder mechanization within Coted'Ivoire and its implications for employment generation in agriculture deserves further investigation. 66 The 2011-2016 regional US$44 million West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), which Coted'Ivoire participates in and which is thefirst phase of a 10-year program, provides an initial step in addressing the staple crop productivity gap. The program focused on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops (plantain, rice, manioc, rice, maize, mango) and animal husbandry (chicken, pork). Regional research centers were set up, each focusing on one crop. The center in Coted'Ivoire focused on plantain. 67 WorldBank (2012a, 2014) provides a useful starting point. 68 Deininger et al.

19dff3e8-fc0e-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor93.txt	There is renewed interest in the agricultural sector as an engine of growth and development and greater recognition of the importance of women in agriculture.	There is renewed interest in the agricultural sector as an engine of growth and development and greater recognition of the importance of women in agriculture .	"There is renewed interest in the agricultural sector as an engine of growth and development and greater recognition of the importance of women in agriculture. However, without tools for measuring the impact of agricultural interventions on women's empowerment, the impacts of programs on empowerment (or disempowerment) are likely to receive much less attention than income or other more measurable outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for measures of empowerment that are robust, inclusive, and comparable over time and space. Indexes that capture many different dimensions provide a summary measure that allows for comparability. Because most indexes and indicators used in monitoring development progress on gender equity have little coverage of the agricultural sector, whereas many agriculture-related indicators are gender-blind, there is a clear need for a tool to measure and monitor the impact of agricultural interventions on empowerment of women within the agricultural sector (Kishor and Subaiya 2008; Malhotra and Schuler 2005). As noted by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (2012), ""Data not only measures progress, it inspires it. . . . What gets measured gets done. Once you start measuring problems, people are more inclined to take action to fix them because nobody wants to end up at the bottom of a list of rankings."" The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a new survey-based index designed to measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. The WEAI was initially developed as a tool to reflect women's empowerment that may result from the US government's Feed the Future Initiative, which commissioned the development of the WEAI. However, the WEAI or adaptations of it can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time."

The governments of the five researched countries recognise that there is a clear requirement to invest more in their education systems .	Governments understand need for increased investment in education To buttress a strong basic level of English among the population, government expenditure on education as a proportion of overall expenditure is growing. Enrolment in tertiary education is high in Nigeria and Cameroon. Higher education in both is increasingly conducted in English, suggesting that graduates from these countries are better equipped for the international work environment. Rwanda, Bangladesh and Pakistan are currently less prepared, mainly due to lower funding, although this is changing as government expenditure on education increases. The primary motivating factor for improving English skills is the desire to improve employment opportunities. The governments of the five researched countries recognise that there is a clear requirement to invest more in their education systems. Rwanda was most dynamic in this area, with 21% of total government expenditure spent on education. Bangladesh and Cameroon spent some 8% and 17%, respectively. In Nigeria and Pakistan education accounted for 13% and 2% of government expenditure. To put this into perspective, a developed country such as the UK spends 10-12% of total annual expenditure on education. Education seen as poverty escape route Each of the researched countries saw economic growth slow in 2009. However, the fact that English is regarded as offering a key competitive advantage in a difficult employment environment means that demand for English education throughout these countries remained high.

In many instances , the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines .	"The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history. Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

Rice constitutes nearly 40 % of total crop area harvested and is the country 's staple food , accounting for slightly more than half of caloric intake and nearly half of protein intake .	Recent developments in the rice sector The agricultural sector (including forestry and fisheries) contributed approximately one-sixth of GDP in 2000, with rice production responsible for about one-fourth of this contribution. Rice constitutes nearly 40% of total crop area harvested and is the country's staple food, accounting for slightly more than half of caloric intake and nearly half of protein intake. Rice accounts for 20% of total expenditures for the poorest quarter of the urban population. Even in rural areas, many poor people are net consumers of rice, since 45% of rural households on Java do not own any land and another 20% own less than 0.25 ha. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Indonesia was the world's largest rice importer, often importing one-fourth of total supplies on the world market. From 1967 to 1986, however, total rice production tripled, probably the most extraordinary growth rate of staple food production in human history, and self-sufficiency was achieved by the mid-1980s. This rapid production growth was achieved through the adoption of modern high-yielding varieties and fertilizers by farmers. Adoption of these varieties was greatly facilitated by government programs such as fertilizer subsidies and rice price stabilization around the long-term trend of world prices. Large investments in rural infrastructure such as irrigation, roads, and schools also played a critical role.

As IUCN recorded in a review of the use of the categories in 2004 , ' Indigenous groups ...	In reality the recognition by a protected area management authority of protected areas owned/managed by indigenous communities is often linked to a community's response to an external threat to their traditional ownership/management. Becoming part of a network can help secure rights and ensure continuity of livelihoods and traditions. This process of 'formal' recognition can simplify the process of ensuring a site meets the definition of a protected area, assigning the category and having the site recorded within national and international data on protected area. The Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) of Australia, for example, used the categories system from the onset; the advantages of this were perceived by all parties. As IUCN recorded in a review of the use of the categories in 2004, 'Indigenous groups ... liked the idea of adopting an internationally recognised system because they felt it reinforced their status as legitimate protected area managers and thus engaged them into an internationally significant agenda, something they have struggled to achieve in Australia. From other stakeholders' perspective (i.e. government and NGOs) the IUCN category system gave the IPA concept more credibility and parity with the mainstream protected area system and so their criticisms were somewhat diminished. From the perspective of the Commonwealth government, who are the funders and promoters of the initiative, it also gave greater confidence that IPAs were worth investing in with scarce conservation dollars' (Bishop et al., 2004, pages 142-143).

Using sound cultural practices reduces pest problems and , therefore , results in lower pesticide use .	"Reducing pesticide use is one of the best ways to protect fish and wildlife resources. Using sound cultural practices reduces pest problems and, therefore, results in lower pesticide use. Cultural practices that decrease the need for pesticides include rotating crops, selecting resistant varieties (when possible), planting and harvesting at the proper time, and using integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. IPM is a farming approach that employs alternative methods of pest control, rather than relying solely on agrichemicals. With IPM, pesticides are used only when the cost of applying a pesticide is outweighed by the cost of pest damage to the crop. This ""threshold"" must be reached before chemical pest control is economically justified. In this way, IPM practices help to reduce pesticide use and protect wildlife and the environment."

In many ways , it is a return to the pre-Industrial Revolution era when China and India dominated world GDP in large due to their great populations , and relatively efficient agricultural sectors at that time .	It is expected that the shiftin economic power that we have seen in recent decades will continue. Our model projects that China's share of world GDP in PPP terms will increase from 16.5% in 2014 to a peak of around 20% in 2030 before declining to around 19.5% in 2050. India's share of world GDP in PPP terms could increase steadily from just under 7% in 2014 to around 13.5% in 2050. Our model suggests that India could overtake the EU and the US in terms of share of world GDP in PPP terms by 2044 and 2049 respectively. Given the rise of India and China, our model suggests that the US and the EU's share of world GDP in PPP terms will face a steady decline from around 33% in 2014 to only around 25% by 2050. This shift of global economic power to Asia may occur somewhat more quickly or slowly than this, of course, but the general direction of change and the historic nature of this shift are clear.

A second area of work addresses evidence from the development and monitoring of education sector plans .	The ongoing Effective Partnership Review seeks to address that issue. It began by taking stock of the state of the partnership through extensive consultations in the first half of 2018. This led to a Board-approved action plan to address inconsistencies and inefficiencies, with a particular focus on the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, authorities and resources of key roles in the partnership. In December 2018, the Board requested exploration of different options for adjustments to the country model, based on four agreed principles: >> A focus on country-level mutual accountability >> Reinforcing national government ownership, political will and capacity >> Rebalancing the country-level model to ensure GPE grants and processes support the development and effective implementation of high-quality, well-financed, government-owned education sector plans >> Achieving a reduction in GPE country-level processes and transaction costs while maintaining robust mechanisms for ensuring quality and managing risk The next steps include efforts in four key areas. The first seeks to strengthen country-level partnership and policy dialogue. Proposals for how to build on existing good practice and promote country-owned partnership agreements and ways to measure effectiveness are being considered. A second area of work addresses evidence from the development and monitoring of education sector plans. This considers how to strengthen government ownership of sector plans and how to place greater emphasis on implementation. Finally, the partnership is considering how to better streamline and clarify grant application and implementation processes to reduce transaction costs and ensure clarity of responsibilities and accountabilities from country level through to the governance mechanisms of GPE. 83 .

MENA's below-average competitiveness is primarily a result of low scores on indicators related to natural and cultural resources and international openness. The region's historical and religious heritage and geographic features create the potential for significant natural and cultural tourism; yet, while some individual nations come close, no MENA country scores above the global average for natural resources and only Egypt and Iran score above for cultural resources. In fact, the entire region's score in both of these areas has fallen in recent years. More needs to be done to expand habit protection and heritage sites. Moreover, digital demand for MENA's natural, cultural and entertainment demand is fairly low, indicating potential gaps in marketing and traveller perceptions. One potential reason for this gap is continued safety and security concerns. Eleven MENA countries rank within the bottom 40 for terrorism incidents, with two among the worst 10 countries globally. Further, the region is plagued by geopolitical tensions, instability and conflict. Security concerns also play a role in why MENA members are some of the most restrictive when it comes to international openness, with only Qatar, Oman and Morocco making significant improvements. Consequently, travellers often face barriers when visiting the region, while the aviation and overall T&T sector is stifled by limiting bilateral air service and regional trade agreements.

Observable characteristics of the selfemployed can thus be used to identify individuals who have potential to become successful entrepreneurs.62 To illustrate the point, a successful entrepreneur is defined as someone who employs others and is not living in poverty. The share of this group in total employment is small and relatively stable across countries at different levels of development.63 The share of selfemployed workers without paid employees, on the other hand, initially increases and then declines with GDP per capita (figure 3.14a). At its peak, which corresponds to low-income countries, the share of self-employed workers without paid employees reaches almost three-fifths of total employment. Among this group, a majority are individuals with relatively low potential to succeed. Their characteristics are closer to those of wage workers than of employers.64 However, if each of the self-employed workers with high potential were to create a single additional job, total employment would increase substantially, somewhat more so in low-income countries (figure 3.14b).

"Indonesia cited "" food security "" and price management considerations as the principal objectives of the authorization , but the Indonesian government separately cited its aspirations for food self-sufficiency ."	"BULOG maintains exclusive authority to import standard unbroken rice (medium grain, medium quality). Indonesia cited ""food security"" and price management considerations as the principal objectives of the authorization, but the Indonesian government separately cited its aspirations for food self-sufficiency. BULOG is not allowed to import rice before, during, or immediately after the main harvest period. Private firms are only allowed to import broken rice for processing or specialty rice varieties, such as basmati and jasmine rice, for retail and food service. Importers of broken and specialty rice must obtain a special MOA importer identification number. Since 2014, Indonesia has refused to issue import recommendations for japonica rice to private traders, although permitted under MOT regulations. In 2016, BULOG was appointed as Indonesia's sole importer of feed corn, plantation white sugar, and buffalo meat (carabeef). Additionally, through MOT Regulations 57/2017 and 58/2018, the Indonesian government sets farmer level and consumer level reference prices for rice, corn, soybeans, sugar, shallots, beef, chicken, eggs, and cooking oil, respectively. According to these regulations, BULOG and other SOEs can intervene in the market when prices surpass or are below threshold targets. In practice, BULOG's market operations are primarily done in the rice sector. Several times in 2018, BULOG sold rice from its stock to dampen high domestic rice prices with the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs authorizing BULOG to import 1.8 million tons of rice. In 2018, BULOG also imported about 80,000 tons of low-priced Indian buffalo meat, which was sold at set prices for low-income consumers. This action was particularly important in keeping a lid on beef prices during the peak demand time of Ramadhan. MOT changed the retail reference price for rice twice in 2017, leading to confusion and market distortions. MOT also maintains reference prices for rice, corn, soybeans, sugar, shallots, beef, farm-raised chicken, chicken eggs, and cooking oil."

Specialized training for judges on insolvency procedures was essential for the United Arab Emirates to realize the full benefits of its new insolvency law. Seeking to create a robust legal insolvency framework, the United Arab Emirates adopted a new insolvency law in 2016 that introduced a reorganization procedure and replaced an outdated regime. The adequate application of new insolvency procedures required active court involvement; judges needed relevant bankruptcy experience and training to carry out this role effectively. Judges have been receiving training since the enactment of the law. In 2017 bankruptcy judges participated in two workshops on the new law--one, for 27 bankruptcy judges, was delivered by the Judicial Institute and the other, for 31 judges, was delivered by the U.S. Department of Justice.

For this report, in particular, the choice of issues examined and the structure of the chapter were constrained by the current availability of data. Topics related to housing characteristics or infrastructure, such as access to improved water, use of solid fuels for cooking and access to electricity, are covered more comprehensively because supporting statistics are available for a large number of countries. These statistics have agreed international concepts and definitions and are collected in surveys and censuses on a regular basis. For example, more than 200 countries and areas have available statistics on access to improved water and improved sanitation, for at least two data points between 1990 and 2014; and 180 countries have statistics on the use of solid fuels for cooking for at least two data points.e However, more statistical information is needed on the links between gender and the environment in several areas. Time-use data are largely missing in countries from developing regions, where poor infrastructure and housing conditions, as well as natural hazards result in increased work burdens. For example, data on time spent for water or firewood collection was available for international compilation for only 14 developing countries, either from stand-alone timeuse surveys or from modules on time use attached to other household surveys. Furthermore, time-use data on national and subnational trends, which are needed to assess changes in women's and men's work burdens as a consequence of improvements in infrastructure or deterioration due to droughts, deforestation or desertification, are generally missing.

As such , the rest of this report invites to expand policy discussions on employment from a focus on the number of jobs and unemployment to a broader attention to the quality , inclusiveness , and productivity of jobs .	"Since most people who join the labor force are employed, and demographics largely drive the absolute number of employed individuals in the economy, a focus on the number of jobs in the economy, or overall 'job creation' is missing the core employment challenge in Coted'Ivoire, which mostly relates to the composition and quality of employment. In this context, a broader jobs strategy that centers on 'better jobs' and the issue of 'productive inclusion' for the poor, women and rural populations could address more directly the central challenges of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity in the short to medium term. The objective of an inclusive jobs strategy would go well beyond counting the number of new formal wage jobs created. It would seek to improve earnings and inclusive employment across all occupations, including in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment where the majority of the population will remain employed for the foreseeable future. As such, the rest of this report invites to expand policy discussions on employment from a focus on the number of jobs and unemployment to a broader attention to the quality, inclusiveness, and productivity of jobs. BOX 1.6: IMPACTS OF LABOR-INTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMS ON EMPLOYMENT QUALITY The impact evaluation of the labor-intensive public works program of the Youth Employment and Skills Development Project (PEJEDEC) illustrates how employment programs can increase employment quality in Coted'Ivoire. Shortterm results show that the public works program only increases slightly the share of youths who are employed. This is consistent with the observation that unemployment is relatively low and that most youths are engaged in informal jobs. In this context, the main impact of the program is to change the composition of employment by allowing youths to access better-paying wage jobs. Beyond impacts on economic indicators, participation in the public works program also improves attitudes and ""psychological well-being"", including self-esteem and aspirations towards the future. Overall, youths' well-being improves strongly during the program."

Public confidence in the justice system has diminished. In 2004, the Supreme Court was viewed as still having a reputation to defend but public perception studies indicated that citizens believe that the subordinate courts (particularly magistrates' courts) are prone to corruption.62 TIB conducted sample perception surveys that showed that the judiciary was perceived as the second (after the police) most corrupt public institution. Politicisation of the lower judiciary led to a 'crisis of confidence'.63 Confidence in even the Supreme Court had declined by 2008: While there remain a number of judges on the High Court and Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court of competence and integrity, trust in the superior courts and in the quality of the justice they dispense has fallen considerably, a trend which showed few signs of reversal during the Caretaker Government's tenure.64 As a consequence, members of the public and the private sector have avoided using the formal justice system where they can, using informal dispute resolution mechanisms and arbitration where available.

CHAPTER 9 A prerequisite for improved living standards is a policy environment conducive to private-sector-led job creation. Macro - economic stability, an enabling business environment, human capital, and the rule of law are all necessary ingredients. Adequate macroeconomic policies mitigate aggregate fluctuations and keep key relative prices aligned. The business environment provides the basic public goods needed for the private sector to operate: infrastructure, access to finance, and sound regulation. Human capital is formed through good nutrition, health, and education that builds human skills. The rule of law ensures the enforcement of contracts; it also includes the progressive realization of rights to avoid a situation where growth coexists with unacceptable forms of work.

Recognizing that some settings may present particular epidemiology situations, cultural contexts or health system requirements, the addition of more specialized CHWs, with clear division of roles vis-a-vis polyvalent CHWs, should be considered when aligned with public policy objectives and instrumental to the attainment of population health goals.

The movement of labor out of agriculture has been facilitated by close urban proximity, resulting from Bangladesh's high population density. Special links allowed by proximity also may have supported productivity growth among laborers engaged in rural nonfarm sectors. The ready- Urbanizing countries Urbanizing countries endowed with abundant unskilled labor have the potential to enter a virtuous jobs circle. The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities, especially in light manufacturing. These jobs may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and limited or negligible benefits, but in general they are preferable to jobs in agriculture. They can also be the entry point to a process of economic and technological upgrading that leads to better jobs in the future.34 Employment opportunities for the unskilled thus provide avenues out of poverty for large numbers of households. In countries in which women's jobs choices have been restricted, new employment opportunities in urbanizing economies can bring about important changes at the household and society levels.

Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion.

This was achieved by Action Aid and the local authorities in Marracuene and Manhica. Time was taken to ensure the accuracy of the lists and this proved to be extremely important. The list was a consensus list used by all agencies and government and regularly updated for the resettlement of the population .	The challenge now is to strengthen and institutionalize the relationship as has happened in Inhambane.

In many high-income and some middleincome countries with largely formal labor markets, job search services have been overhauled in the past 10 years.

These contracts must ensure that providers reach those in most need and do not concen- and against harassment and confiscation of their inventories of goods by municipal authorities.37 These nontraditional workers' organizations are increasingly participating in global institutions such as the ILO.

They can fill the gap when employers or workers underinvest in training because of various market failures, and they can mitigate the impacts of economic downturns by providing workers with temporary employment or creating incentives for employers to hire. ALMPs are politically attractive for governments eager to do something about job creation.

Across GPE developing country partners, on average, more girls than boys are still out of primary and lower secondary school, and girls' out-of-school rates for lower secondary have stagnated over the past three years. This means that girls are falling farther behind boys in access to lower secondary education. Likewise, progress on lower secondary out-of-school rates in FCACs is erratic, and DCPs in the lower left quadrant of Figure 2.8 are especially facing challenges. 16.

The challenges are how to sustain the high yields already achieved in this ecosystem and whether modern science can be used to explore possibilities of a further shiftin yield potential .	Enhancing productivity and sustainability of favorable environments The major factor in poverty alleviation in recent years has been the reduction in the unit cost of production and the downward trend in real prices of food. Improved technologies were adopted fastest in the favorable irrigated environment, which accounts for nearly 45% of the rice land and more than 70% of total rice production. Because of its importance, we must continue to focus on this favorable environment as the major source of rice supply to meet the growing demand from the expanding urban population and the rural landless. The challenges are how to sustain the high yields already achieved in this ecosystem and whether modern science can be used to explore possibilities of a further shiftin yield potential. The options for extending the area under high-yielding modern rice varieties by developing irrigation infrastructure will no longer be available for many countries because of the looming water crisis. Farmers need assistance from rice scientists on how to grow rice with less water and how to operate irrigation systems more efficiently. Technological options must be developed to maintain soil fertility and control pest pressure.

"Labeling Export shipping cartons and containers have specific markings and labeling that: * Meet shipping regulations * Ensure proper handling * Conceal the identity of the contents * Help receivers identify shipments * Ensure compliance with environmental and safety standards The overseas buyer usually specifies which export marks should appear on the cargo for easy identification by receivers. Products may require many markings for shipment. For example, exporters need to put the following markings on cartons to be shipped: * Shipper's mark * Country of origin (in your case, ""U.S.A."") * Weight marking (in pounds and kilograms) * Number of packages and size of cases (in inches and centimeters) * Handling marks (i.e., international pictorial symbols) * Cautionary markings, such as ""This Side Up"" or ""Use No Hooks"" (in English and in the language of the destination country) * Port of entry * Labels for hazardous materials (i.e., universal symbols adopted by the International Air Transport Association and the International Maritime Organization) * Ingredients (if applicable, also included in the language of the destination country) Documentation Your company should seriously consider having the freight forwarder handle the documentation that exporting requires. Forwarders are specialists in this process. Several documents are commonly used in exporting, but the ones required in a particular transaction depends on the requirements of the U.S. government and the government of the importing country. (See Appendix D for a collection of sample forms.) U.S. Commercial Service * A Basic Guide to Exporting138 Documentation must be precise because slight discrepancies or omissions may prevent merchandise from being exported, may result in nonpayment, or may even result in the seizure of the exporter's goods by U.S. or foreign customs officials. Collection documents are subject to precise time limits and may not be honored by a bank if the time has expired. Most documentation is routine for freight forwarders and customs brokers, but as the exporter, you are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the necessary documents."

A second group of students comes to school just to avoid being questioned by the school administration but shows no interest when there. These two groups affect the third group, which is small, of those students who attend intending to learn.

Funding for ensuring quality broadcasts is the main challenge.

The sustainability is ensured by many factors. The main ones are: the fact that the Philharmonic has its own venue and three symphonic collec1ves, which perform regularly at the concert hall and are available for recording. The high (and growing) demand from the popula1on is an important factor, especially from our beneficiaries in the remote areas of the region, pa1ents of the welfare ins1tu1ons, educa1onal system, etc. Another important factor is the financial support, in our case it's the governmental grants. Personnel is important - tech staff, musicologists, editors, admin, etc. This is a replicable project and can be reproduced by a similar cultural organiza1on which has a capacity to create video programs and broadcast them via internet. Besides, it is always possible to join our project and re-broadcast our content to your audiences.	The sustainability is ensured by many factors.

The answers to these questions have important implications for the strategy for sustaining food security through trade for the affluent Asian nations .	But what will happen if every country in Asia abandons the production of staple grains and reallocates resources to more profitable economic activities and opts for sustaining food security through international trade? In Japan and the Republic of Korea, consumers now pay for domestic rice a price many times higher than that in the world market. But, who will produce the exportable surplus for them? Will rice supply to the world market increase substantially in response to higher prices? What would be the political response in rice-exporting countries to international transactions in staple food when trade generates scarcity in the domestic market? What would be the impact of rising food prices on inflation and other macroeconomic variables?

The areas of decision-making refer to ( 1 ) agricultural production , ( 2 ) which inputs to buy , ( 3 ) which types of crops to grow , ( 4 ) when to take or who would take crops to market , and ( 5 ) livestock production .	The second is a measure of autonomy that reflects a person's ability to act on what he or she values. This indicator probes the person's own understanding of the situation and how he or she balances different motivations--to avoid punishment or social disapproval and to act on his or her own values (Alkire 2007). The indicator adapts the measure of autonomy developed by psychologists Richard Ryan, E. L. Deci, Valery Chirkov, and others working in Self-determination Theory (see Chirkov, Ryan, and Deci 2011). A subindex is constructed from answers to the following: (1) My actions in [area of decision-making] are partly because I will get in trouble with someone if I act differently, (2) Regarding [area of decision-making] I do what I do so others don't think poorly of me, and (3) OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 9 Regarding [area of decision-making] I do what I do because I personally think it is the right thing to do. The areas of decision-making refer to (1) agricultural production, (2) which inputs to buy, (3) which types of crops to grow, (4) when to take or who would take crops to market, and (5) livestock production. An individual is adequate on autonomy if his or her actions are relatively more motivated by his or her own values than by coercion or fear of others' disapproval. Note that this autonomy indicator, unlike decision-making indicators, captures the situation of women living in female-only households, who may indeed be empowered as sole decision makers but whose autonomy may still be deeply constrained by social norms or force of circumstance. It also reflects the situation in joint households--a joint decision may be more or less autonomous, depending on circumstances.

The foundations receive funding from a multidonor group called SIBTA ( System for Bolivian Agricultural Technology ) implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture .	In Boliva: There are two factors that contributed to the significant progress in the peanut program in Bolivia. ANAPO plays a key role in technology transfer and seed production. The first factor is ANAPO's strong linkages to technology transfer agencies such as the development foundations (FDTA) Project UFL16P - 201 - funded by a group of donors and farmers' associations. The foundations receive funding from a multidonor group called SIBTA (System for Bolivian Agricultural Technology) implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture. ANAPO has been contracted by the government through the development foundations to provide technologies and advisory services to small-scale producers. ANAPO and its partners have conducted numerous meetings and farmer training sessions in Bolivia. Men and women farmers have benefited from field days (i.e., recent Peanut Summit/Tour held in February 2005 and attended by over 100 farmers in the FDTA-Valles region), extension publications and growers' training manuals, and demonstration of simple equipment for harvesting, threshing, and grading. Scientists and technical support staff have benefited from workshops. Presently, FDTA-Valles/ANAPO is in three areas of the Valles Region, but they plan expand activities into the Chaco Region in 2005. Improved varieties introduced by ANAPO occupy about one-half of the production in the Valles Region. The second factor is the development of a Peanut Seed Production Program. Seed multiplication activities are implemented by ANAPO, a private association of farmers with seed multiplication responsibilities) have particularly good potential for technology transfer (quality seed and new cultivars). ANAPO sells certified seeds of improved varieties to farmers, facilitating the diffusion of new varieties quickly, one of the bottlenecks in many developing countries. Eight varieties are being multiplied, and counter-season production will speed up the process. In the United States. In the U.S., the Georgia Peanut Commission has shown keen interest in the collaborative project in Bolivia. Commission members have participated in field days. The Chairperson of the GPC Research Committee has shown particular interest and has been very supportive of the Peanut CRSP activities in Bolivia.

Breeding and Variety Selection: One peanut variety was released by ANAPO in 2004. A good range of germplasm has been developed through crossing, both in the U.S. and Bolivia, and some derivatives show considerable potential for resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), leaf spot diseases, and Aspergillus flavus (producer of aflatoxin) fungal invasion. ANAPO released a new variety (Mairana, a white-seeded variety) in 2004, a selection from the earlier introduced U.S. genotypes. It is now under seed production by ANAPO for wider distribution in peanut growing areas in the Mairana valley and other zones. Three potential lines (Accession 32, 72, and 75) are being tested in advanced trials in three zones (in Mairana, 26 Agustos, and Saavedra). A new variety from these three lines could be released in Bolivia in 2005. Some ANAPO promising lines (including genotypes from U.S.) are being tested by the Promocion de Investigacion de Productos Andianos (PROINPA) for adaptability for the altiplano (mountain zone). Crosses with local wild peanut species is also planned. Programa Investigaciones de Mani (PIROMANI), a private institution that maintains a peanut germplasm bank, including wild relatives, in Cochabamba has given access to its collection to ANAPO's breeders through a formal agreement. ANAPO has also received germplasm from Argentina and Brazil that is included in the ongoing trials. Production, harvesting, and processing technologies. A package of improved agronomic practices has been developed by ANAPO researchers to introduce to farmers whose practices are very traditional. These include: (1) planting density (rows closer together and more plants per meter of row); (2) one pre-emergence and one post-emergence herbicide spraying based on intensity and weed species; (3) one or two fungicide sprayings based on disease and intensity of inoculum; and (4) zero tillage technology for sustainable peanut production.

For this survey , a household is a group of people who live together and take food from the same pot .	For this survey, a household is a group of people who live together and take food from the same pot. The important part of this definition is that the group of individuals shares at least some common resources and makes some common budget and expenditure decisions. A household member is someone who has lived in the household at least six months and at least three days in each week in those months. Even those persons who are not blood relations (such as servants, lodgers, or agricultural laborers) are members of the household if they meet these qualifications, and alternatively, individuals who sleep in the household but do not bear any costs for food or do not take food from the same pot are not considered household members. This definition, including more specific examples and guidelines, is found in the survey enumeration manual and embedded in questionnaires. In some cases, it may make sense to add or subtract from the definition used in the pilot or to substitute an alternative definition for a certain context; however, the most important part is that enumerators have the same understanding of definitions so that implementation is consistent across households. Research from IFPRI and others has found that household definition can have significant impacts on variation of outcome indicators, particularly surrounding labor and consumption (Beaman and Dillon 2012).

On November 21, 2012, pursuant to a Kenyan Cabinet decision and Presidential order, the Kenyan Ministry of Public Health ordered public health officials to remove from the market all foods, feed, and seeds derived from agricultural biotechnology and to ban genetically engineered (GE) food and feed imports. Despite 310 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS announcing in August 2015 that the Kenyan government would lift the import ban on GE products by October 2015, the government maintained the ban throughout 2018. Kenya's GE ban has blocked both food aid and commercial U.S. agricultural exports derived from agricultural biotechnology from Kenya. The restriction affects U.S. exports of processed and unprocessed foods and feed ingredients, such as soy, corn, and distiller dried grains. The GE import ban also affects transshipment. Food aid shipments of GE commodities destined for inland east African countries, which would ordinarily enter through the Port of Mombasa, must be diverted to other ports or reformulated with non-GE commodities. In September 2017, Kenya approved open field trials for GE cotton (MON 15985) and derived varieties, and for GE corn developed for drought tolerance and insect resistance under the Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) project. While political bottlenecks have slowed the process for dissemination and use of GE corn, the national performance trials for GE cotton began in 2018 and the first commercial cultivation could begin in fall 2019. However, it is unclear how Kenya will import sufficient GE cotton seeds for planting with the GE import ban in place. In addition to cotton, GE Gypsophila (baby's breath) intended for export to the international cut flower market, including the United States, was supposed to be commercialized in 2019 but now appears to be delayed because of uncertain market access in Europe. The U.S. Government continues to engage the Kenyan government and stakeholders to support the adoption of these technologies and address the challenges.

Almost all this land has already been covered with mod- 64 Rice almanac ern varieties and the best farmers' yields are already approaching the potential that scientists are able to attain with today's knowledge in that environment. With intensive monoculture of rice in the irrigated systems using high doses of industrial chemicals, the natural resources are under stress, and scientists find it difficult to sustain the high yields. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, rice yield has remained stagnant at around 6.0 to 6.5 t/ha after reaching that level in the late 1960s and mid-1970s, respectively. In the humid tropics, the maximum achievable yield on farms is less than 6.0 t/ha because of increased pest pressure, frequent cloudy days with below-optimal sunshine, and susceptibility of the crop to floods, droughts, and strong winds. In regions with good irrigation infrastructure, this potential yield ""ceiling"" is about to be reached."

Ethnic armed groups committed abuses including abductions and forced recruitment. Both the army and armed groups used landmine-like weapons that harmed civilians. In the Philippines, a five-month battle in Marawibetween the military and an alliance of militants aligned with the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS), caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians, dozens of civilian deaths, and widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure.

These include watershed management and promote increased agricultural productivity through strategies such as climate-smart agriculture, water conservation, soil fertility management, erosion control and soil management. Another key policy that supports agroforestry is the national horticulture policy, which promotes fruit tree planting by establishing incentive mechanisms, strengthening value chains and developing markets for horticulture products; it has a significant effect on the promotion of FLR in Rwanda.

However, French and English language quantitative indicators ! Euromonitor International Page 90 German are popular for economic reasons, as they improve the chances of employment in international organisations. Learning French is also helpful for Bangladeshis hoping to emigrate to Canada, as Canada is officially a bilingual country. There are good facilities to learn these languages in Dhaka University, the Alliance Francaise and the Goethe Institute. Nonetheless, hundreds of students every year present themselves for TOEFL and IELTS exams in English. Some key social trends had a positive impact on the development of English in Bangladesh. Starting with the most important, these include: * Improvements in education: more qualified teachers are reaching the poorest areas due to help from NGOs and international aid such as from UNESCO; * Exposure to international media: this particularly motivates the younger generation to learn English in order to engage with global social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook; * Access to modern technologies, such as mobile phones and the Internet, which frequently use English as an operating language.

The state of a person's health is shaped not only by one's access to health services, but by a multitude of factors, which are termed the ""determinants of health"". Figure 1 shows how the determinants of health can be applied to migrants across the migration cycle. Individual determinants are factors such as age, sex and genetic predisposition to disease, and the epidemiological profile of a given context and the disease exposures associated with it. Structural determinants are usually politically mediated - such as legal frameworks and societal attitudes towards migrants - and can result in a range of inequalities in socioeconomic status. For migrants, structural determinants of health include the conditions associated with the different phases of their migration journey - pre-migration, movement, arrival and integration, and (for some) return. 3 WHO, 1946. 212 Migration and health: Current issues, governance and knowledge gaps Fi gu re 1 .

For more examples of research collaborations or national Footprint reviews, please visit www.footprintnetwork.org/reviews. Frequently asked questions how is the ecological footprint calculated? The Ecological Footprint measures the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to produce the resources an individual, population or activity consumes and to absorb the waste they generate, given prevailing technology and resource management. This area is expressed in global hectares, hectares with world-average biological productivity. Footprint calculations use yield factors to take into account national differences in biological productivity (e.g., tonnes of wheat per UK hectare versus per Argentina hectare) and equivalence factors to take into account differences in world average productivity among land types (e.g., world average forest versus world average cropland).

The most appropriate level of primary or secondary education prior to CHW training may depend on the complexity of the tasks undertaken by CHWs. While a higher level of prior education may be associated with improved knowledge and performance, attrition (due to better and more diverse work opportunities) might be higher among more educated CHWs. A requirement for relatively higher levels of education may restrict excessively the pool of potential candidates, risks excluding women in particular in many contexts, and would be difficult to implement in contexts with low levels of educational attainment. The minimum level of education considered to be appropriate will depend on the tasks to be delivered, the context of the services and the training support available. Testing for certain competencies during selection (for example, literacy and numeracy) may be considered as an alternative approach in contexts where employing strict education attainment requirements would imply restricting excessively the applicant pool, for women in particular.

For example , it would include the Footprint needed to manufacture products that are exported and consumed by people outside the country .	"Part 2 Ecological accounting is the sum of the Footprints for all resources harvested and all waste generated within the country's geographical borders. For example, it would include the Footprint needed to manufacture products that are exported and consumed by people outside the country. This includes all the area within a country necessary for supporting the actual harvest of primary products (cropland, grazing land, forest land, and fishing grounds), the country's infrastructure and hydropower (built-up land), and the area needed to absorb fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions generated within the country (Carbon Footprint). The consumption Footprint differs from the production Footprint through trade: a country's consumption Footprint also contains the biocapacity of imported products and services. When biocapacity is made available to other countries through exports, this is reflected in the consumption Footprint of the importing country. When the Footprint of a country exceeds the biocapacity of the area available within that country, it runs an ""ecological deficit"" and we call it an ""ecological debtor."" Conversely, an ecological surplus exists when the biocapacity of a region exceeds its population's Footprint. Those countries with more biocapacity at their disposal than their population uses, in net terms, have an ""ecological surplus"" and are called ""ecological creditors"". Ecological surplus or deficit is analogous to a trade surplus or deficit. In a global economy, it is important to understand whether a country has a trade surplus or deficit. In the same way, knowledge of its ecological balance sheet also reveals important information. To maintain high-quality results when conducting Footprint analysis, Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have developed international standards. The standards are designed to ensure that Footprint assessments are produced consistently and according to communityproposed best practices. They aim to ensure that assessments are conducted and communicated in a way that is accurate and transparent. land types used in ecological ."

Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are 137WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. This perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting socio-spatial inequalities in the era of globalization.

Jobs that provide access to voice can be empowering and give workers a stake and shared interest in their work.30 Informal workers lack access to representation on the job and are similarly excluded from local government and economic associations. Associations of self-employed workers and farmers help fill these gaps.31 A core strategy of the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) in India has been to empower its members and partners by increasing their say in communities (box 4.5)."

In the context of the SDGs and UHC , primary health care is receiving greater attention .	Community-based TB activities are found all along the pathway of TB prevention and care, and can positively influence the quality and outcome of health services offered. They are delivered primarily by community health workers (CHWs) and community volunteers (CVs)a who are drawn from within the community, and thus are both accessible and acceptable to community members. In the context of the SDGs and UHC, primary health care is receiving greater attention. A growing number of countries are taking steps to absorb cadres of CHWs into the workforce of national health systems. WHO guidelines (19) promote the establishment of CHW programmes as an integral part of primary health care, demonstrated to be feasible even in low-to middle-income countries.

The chemical status of the floodwater depends on the water source, soil, nature and biomass of aquatic fauna and flora, cultural practices, and rice growth. The pH of the standing water is determined by the alkalinity of the water source, soil pH, algal activity, and fertilization. Because of the growth of algae and aquatic weeds, the pH and O 2 content undergo marked diurnal fluctuations. During daytime, the pH may increase to 11 and the standing water becomes oversaturated with O 2 because of photosynthesis of the aquatic biomass. Standing water stabilizes the soil water regime, moderates the soil temperature regime, prevents soil erosion, and enhances C and N supply.

Companies involved in legal disputes generally try to avoid the lower courts due to the high frequency of corruption at this judicial level.19 Corruption in the police force is widespread. In their most recent household survey, TIB found that the majority of households had to pay bribes when lodging first information reports at police stations, when registering general diaries and when requesting clearance certificates.20 In the absence of any strong accountability mechanisms, incentives are strong for police officers to continue with corrupt practices.

The most efficient schools are on the frontier and the efficiency of the other schools is evaluated by measuring the distance to this empirical frontier, and a score between 0 and 1 is given to each school. The higher the efficiency score, the closest is the distance to the frontier and the more efficient is the school. A total of six inputs and two outputs have been included in the analysis. c.

Important challenges remain, but Vietnam is The Republic of Korea effectively used policies to bring out the agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by 2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.

In February 2014, the average number of hours worked a week was around 41.8, with a median around 42 (Figure1.12a). Only 20 percent of employed individuals worked less than 30 hours a week. By contrast, 40 percent of individuals report working more than 60 hours a week. Nonetheless, there are some differences in the number of hours worked by type of employment. Agricultural employment is known to exhibit substantial seasonality, with much lower work during the lean seasons. Individuals in agricultural self-employment worked the least hours compared to other occupations in February 2014, in part due to seasonal patterns (see discussion in Chapters 2 and 3). As discussed in Chapter2, this seasonality in agricultural employment explains a substantial share in differences in average labor productivity across sectors. However, individuals in nonagricultural self-employment work slightly more hours (47.6 ) than those in wage employment (46.7) (Figure1.12c).

The largest share of investments needed for specific diseases or programmes was accounted for by noncommunicable diseases .	"Key findings included the following:  In the ""ambitious"" scenario for resource needs (based on achievement of the 2030 SDG targets), the additional investment (compared with 2014) required per year grew from US$ 134 billion in 2016 to US$ 371 billion (equivalent to an extra US$ 58 per person) in 2030.  Most of the increased investment required (75% of the total) was for expanding and strengthening the health workforce and health services infrastructure (including buildings and medical equipment) to reach recommended benchmarks. The remainder was for specific priorities, including TB. The largest share of investments needed for specific diseases or programmes was accounted for by noncommunicable diseases.  Overall, health expenditure (in both the ""moderate"" and ""optimistic"" scenarios) was projected to be sufficient to cover ""ambitious"" scenario investment needs in middle-income countries. This is potentially positive news, given that 84% of the estimated burden of TB (in terms of new cases each year) is in middleincome countries. However, given uneven capacity to mobilize additional resources, some countries were expected to face gaps, especially in the first few years. In the period 2026-2030, it was predicted that about five of the 39 middle-income countries included in the analysis would face funding gaps.  Overall, projected health expenditures were not sufficient to cover investment needs in low-income countries, even in the ""optimistic"" scenario for health expenditures and the ""progress"" scenario for resource needs.  Improved revenue generation and management of public expenditures, and increased public health budgets, were needed in both low-and middle-income countries."

Another 1.4 billion work in farming and small household enterprises, or in casual or seasonal day labor. The majority of workers in the poorest countries are engaged in these types of work, outside the scope of an employer-employee relationship. Another 200 million people, a disproportionate share of them youth, are unemployed and actively looking for work. Almost 2 billion working-age adults are neither working nor look ing for work; the majority of these are women, and an unknown number are eager to have a job.1 The jobs challenge facing the world is multifaceted, ranging from improving aspects of the work people do, to supporting the reallocation of people to better jobs, to creating jobs for those who want to work. Youth bulges in some countries are bringing in millions of new job seekers. Sub-Saharan Africa's labor force grows by about 8 million people every year. South Asia's grows by 1 million people every month. Elsewhere, the working population is rapidly aging, and more and more workers are putting off retirement. By 2020, more than 40 million additional jobs will be needed for people 65 years and older.2 Structural and technological changes are moving more people from rural areas to cities.

"The global Regulatory Atlas in fall 2016, NCSBN hosted the landmark Regulation 2030 conference. Regulation 2030 brought together nursing regulators and leaders from eight countries, nursing professional organizations, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and other groups. These attendees were tasked with mapping the future of nursing regulation in the following categories: (a) governance, (b) processes, (c) licensure and registration, (d) workforce, (e) education, (f) fitness for practice, and (g) technology. The Regulation 2030 Conference identified data, collaboration, and standardization as major thematic requirements that would enable the evolution of nursing regulation. Specifically, participants imagined the harmonization of regulatory processes around the world, including the optimized capture and sharing of data across nations and continents. As a step toward future outcomes, and keeping with the recognition of data sharing, collaboration, and standardization as keys to delivering those outcomes, NCSBN determined that there was no efficient method for comparing the governance and processes by which nurses are regulated around the world. Therefore, a single resource containing data on the state of nursing regulation in each country that was digital, searchable, and allowed easy comparison across jurisdictions was needed. This resource ultimately became known as the Global Regulatory Atlas. This special issue, ""Global Profile of Nursing Regulation, Education, and Practice,"" summarizes the rich data contained within Global Regulatory Atlas into an enlightening anthology that captures the similarities, differences and details of nursing around the world. A Glossary of frequently used terms in the Atlas and in this report is included in Appendix A. This data is presented in two parts. Part I reports data and findings from a global perspective. Part II reports this data from a regional perspective. Note that some jurisdictions or regions do not have data listed in every category for various reasons, including that the data were not available or collected and documented in their region."

High-yielding modern varieties that are tolerant of droughts , submergence , and problem soils are needed , along with efficient crop management practices , to induce farmers to adopt them and to make a direct assault on poverty .	Improving productivity and livelihood for fragile environments The fragile environments--the infertile uplands, rainfed lowlands subject to frequent droughts and submergence, and the deepwater and coastal areas that suffer from flooding, strong winds, salinity, and other soil-related problems--have had limited benefits from rice science and technological developments. The available modern varieties do not adapt well to these ecosystems and farmers get low and unstable yields and limited gains in profits when they adopt them. As a result, the traditional varieties are still widely grown and the average rice yield has remained low at 1.5 to 2.5 t/ha. These ecosystems, characterized by low farm incomes and high incidence of poverty, account for about 55% of the rice lands.

Practice Although there is limited availability of data within the nursing profession across South America, authorized practice seems to vary depending on nurse type. In Argentina, nurses and licensed nurses both have prescriptive authority and may prescribe any medications. However, neither may refer patients for additional care, nor may they diagnose patients. In Peru, a nurse has a duty to administer healthcare in an emergent situation and, because of this, nurse specialists and general nurses may prescribe medication or refer patients for additional medical care. Both nurse types may diagnose patients. Ancestral midwives in Ecuador may refer patients for additional medical care, diagnose patients, and prescribe medicinal plants and natural remedies. In Brazil, nurses and advanced or specialized nurses possess authority to offer a nursing diagnosis. In addition, these types of nurses may prescribe medications according to protocols, clinical and therapeutic guidelines, or other technical regulations established by the federal, state, or municipal authorities. These protocols and guidelines are subject to the legal provisions of the profession. Prescriptive authority granted to nurses and advanced or specialized nurses is regarding medications previously established in each respective public health program and those routinely approved by each health institution. Nurses and advanced or specialized nurses, however, do not have the autonomy to request examinations and prescribe medications in isolated private practices.

A Typical Letter of Credit Transaction Here are the typical steps in issuing an irrevocable letter of credit that has been confirmed by a U.S. bank: 1. After the exporter and the buyer have agreed on the terms of a sale, the buyer arranges for its bank to open a letter of credit that specifies the documents needed for payment. The buyer determines which documents will be required. 2. The buyer's bank issues (opens) its irrevocable letter of credit and includes all instructions to the seller relating to the shipment. 3. The buyer's bank sends its irrevocable letter of credit to a U.S. bank and requests confirmation. The exporter may request that a particular U.S. bank be the confirming bank, or the foreign bank may select a U.S. correspondent bank. 4. The U.S. bank prepares a letter of confirmation to forward to the exporter, along with the irrevocable letter of credit. 5. The exporter carefully reviews all conditions in the letter of credit. The exporter's freight forwarder is contacted to make sure that the shipping date can be met.

The World's Women 201524 tion of orphans (often due to HIV and conflict) and fostered86 children, only 59 per cent of children live with both parents, while 25 per cent live with one parent. The remaining 16 per cent, most of whom are fostered children, do not live with either of their parents.87 At older ages, women and men live more independently than before, often alone or as a couple without younger generations present in the household. This trend is largely the result of demographic ageing, increasing financial security and shifting family norms.88 Living arrangements at older ages are different for women and men, particularly in developed regions, and marital status is a major determinant of such arrangements. As shown earlier, in most countries there are more widows than widowers. Older women are more likely than older men to survive their spouses since women have lower mortality rates and tend to marry men that are a few years older. Older women are also less likely than men to remarry after their spouse dies. Men, on the other hand, are more likely than women to be in a marital union. The proportion of people in a marital union in 2005-2008 was 80 per cent among men aged 60 years and over and 48 per cent among women of the same age.89 Other factors contribute to the living arrangements of older persons. In some societies, social norms on intergenerational relationships and family support prescribe that younger generations provide for their parents in old age. Such norms have changed in many countries, particularly when large proportions of older persons have access to their own pensions and income, and there are fewer children and grandchildren to provide support. 86 Fostering refer to sending children to live with relatives or other persons that are not biological parents while at least one of their parents is alive. 87 Unweighted averages for 30 countries based on the latest available DHS data over the period 2015-2013 (accessed January 2015). 88 United Nations, 2013l. 89 ibid.

Without viable , alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards .	On-farm and off-farm activities can be complementary in assisting households to manage risk. In other contexts off-farm income has been important in helping small-scale farmers cope with shocks in India (Gaurav 2015), Mozambique (Cunguara et al. 2011), and South America (Bebbington 1999). In Odisha, vulnerable farming communities are characterized by dependence Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ on subsistence rice farming and limited off-farm opportunities (Panda 2016). In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined. This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.

"Many of those taking action to demand respect for human rights and accountability for violations were demonized and criminalized, leading to shrinking civic space.

The Myanmar security forces' campaign of violence against the Rohingya people in northern Rakhine State, which amounted to crimes against humanity, created a human rights and humanitarian crisis in the country and in neighbouring Bangladesh. Lawlessness and violence increased further in the Philippines. The President's contempt for human rights in the""war on drugs"" was characterized by mass killings, mostly of people from poor and marginalized groups, including children. The scope of the killings and rampant impunity led to growing calls for an investigation at the international level.

The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world .	Millions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year. Disruptions such as cyclones, floods and wildfires destroy homes and assets, and contribute to the displacement of people. Slow-onset processes - such as sea-level rise changes in rainfall patterns and droughts - contribute to pressures on livelihoods, and access to food and water, that can contribute to decisions to move away in search of more tenable living conditions. Advances in meteorological and other sciences which inform about the dynamics and pace of climate change indicate that disruptions ranging from extreme weather events to large scale changes in ecosystems are occurring at a pace and intensity unlike any other known period of time on Earth.2 Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increasingly affect migration and other forms of people moving to manage these changing risks.3 This chapter provides an up-to-date overview of environmental change and the spectrum of human mobility. It first explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration, ranging from the view that human mobility including migration is a security issue, that it is an issue of protection, and that it is a matter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change. The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world. It then summarizes recent developments in the international policy sphere on the topic. The conclusion draws out the implications for research, policy and practice.	The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world.

Important challenges remain, but Vietnam is The Republic of Korea effectively used policies to bring out the agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by 2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.

Some of the documented environmental damage to the ecosystems of the region includes : reduction in plant species richness and stream flow , and alteration of the nutrient status of soils .	A wide range of trees species were introduced into southern Africa (South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) for a wide range of purposes. Unfortunately some of these species have become invasive, threatening the biodiversity of the region. Some of the documented environmental damage to the ecosystems of the region includes: reduction in plant species richness and stream flow, and alteration of the nutrient status of soils. In South Africa, an estimated 100,739 km2 (i.e. 8.07% of the country s total area) has been affected by invasive alien tree species. Figures are not readily available for Zimbabwe, but an estimate of 4,500 km2 invaded by non-native trees would be a conservative figure. Zambia is considered to relatively affected by invasive alien tress, although lack of awareness could be contributing to this notion. Control programmes for invasive alien tree species in Zimbabwe and South Africa cost US $100 000 and US $20 million annually, respectively.

Of the 158 countries with data for 2012 (or the latest year over the period 2005-2012), 74 attained gender parity in adult literacy, 4 countries showed disparities to the disadvantage of men and 80 to the disadvantage of women. Women's literacy rates were less than two thirds those of men's in 22 of those countries, four of which are located in Southern Asia (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan), one in Western Asia (Yemen), and the rest in sub-Saharan Africa.55 The vast majority of young men and women have basic reading and writing skills The vast majority of young people (aged 15 to 24) in the world are literate. Over the period 1990- 2012, the global literacy rate for young women rose from 79 to 87 per cent and from 88 to 92 per cent for young men (figure 3.17). This reflects increased participation in formal schooling among younger generations. Youth literacy is almost universal in the more developed regions, in Eastern Asia and in the Caucasus and Central Asia; it is close to being universal in Latin America and in South-Eastern Asia. In parts of the world where many boys and girls do not attend school or drop out, youth literacy rates are much lower than global averages. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the rates are among the lowest in the world, only 64 per cent of young women and 76 per cent of young men are literate. In Oceania and Southern Asia, young men and women have attained basic literacy skills at rates significantly lower than the global averages for each sex.

In addition, it has become apparent that tighter collaboration between the socioeconomic and some of the other projects and thrusts is necessary. This can be done in a variety of ways and the UCONN PI has already begun to outline preliminary thinking on an avenue that will prove worthy of pursuing in the future. 8. Next Steps and Future Directions Complete data analysis and report for the impact assessment of training in Thailand. Disseminate report to all Peanut CRSP PIs so all projects with training components could learn lessons on evaluating training courses and their impact on the overall effort by Peanut CRSP and the Host Country institutions. Complete analysis of the data sets from the Philippine impact study and facilitate preparation of joint papers for publication in refereed journals. Transfer the impact assessment and case study methodologies, including samples of survey instruments, to other Peanut CRSP projects in other regions, using the experiences in the Philippines and Thailand. Carry out additional work on valuing environmental benefits using experimental economics techniques and assessing poverty reduction impacts of peanut research in West Africa. The economic and policy analysis methodologies used in this project should be transferred to other regions where Peanut CRSP is working, starting with stronger collaboration with other U.S. universities working on economic and policy areas (Auburn University, North Carolina State University, University of Connecticut). Negotiate with other partners in the region (i.e., CIRAD) to carry out the planned West African Regional Workshop on economic assessment methodologies in 2005. The result of this workshop would be useful in identifying the specific needs for policy research in the region that Peanut CRSP can pursue in the future.

It is not only the institution but also the students have to play to be proactive with an appropriate futuristic set of mind .	In the present world, education is the most important aspect in society development. For education school is considered to play a major role in ensuring the successful of the development. It is not only the institution but also the students have to play to be proactive with an appropriate futuristic set of mind. The students also need to have good skills as well as they also need to be active in co-curriculum activity along with high academic achievement. Apart from all this factors the environment where the student's lives can determine their performance in their studies. In short, we can say that reason for the variations in their performance in learning and achievement are geographical location, resources, availability of technology and also the quality of teachers.

Many commentators have called into question the solidity of aspects of the global political order forged in the immediate aftermath of the two world wars, including as they relate to alliances and common interests.3 Others are calling this time the ""age of anger"", tracing back the current sense of geopolitical uncertainty and discontent to a dominant and relentless focus on ""logic"" and ""liberal rationalism"" at the expense of emotional responsiveness.4 It is within this context that this world migration report focuses on developments in migration over the last two-year period, with an emphasis on providing analysis that takes into account historical and contemporary factors.

A neighborhood of 5,000 outside the city of Tangerang, Indonesia, started coming to life 25 years ago, when iron, rubber, garment, and thread factories sprang up in the surrounding areas. Some in the neighborhood still work as farmhands. But most women and men earn their living in the factories, as well as in a variety of jobs that rose up alongside them. Many men drive ojeks (motorcycle taxis); women sell sweets and other items by the gates of the factories. Residents also make a living through home-based garment piecework, handicrafts such as broom-making, and construction work; some are civil servants and teachers. Poorer women collect and resell scraps of fabric. The flow of newcomers has also offered an income-generating opportunity to local families from renting rooms for lodging.

Country Notes Primary education (Grundschule) lasts for four years in most Lander except Berlin and Brandenburg where it lasts for six years. The secondary school system (grades 5/7 to 12/13) in the Lander is divided in educational paths (depending on the Land) with the respective leaving certificates and qualifications for which different school types and/or school careers are responsible. All types of vocational schools (grade 10/11 onwards) offer the opportunity to acquire general education certificates. There are general secondary education schools, special schools for the physically or mentally handicapped within the system of general and vocational education, and full-or part-time vocational schools (10th/11th grade on). Four main types of general secondary schools covering compulsory schooling exist: Haupschule, Realschule, Gymnasium and Gesamtschule. Types and names of schools offering several courses of education at lower secondary level differ according to Lander. Secondary education is compulsory and tuition is free. Textbooks and other school material are either free or lent out. From grade 10, pupils may obtain grants if no other financial sources exist.

Our second issue for 2017 was a Special Issue (guest editors, Alexandra Ricard-Guay, European University Institute, and Thanos Maroukis, University of Bath) focused on human trafficking in domestic work looking at severely exploited migrant women domestic workers in different European countries. Contributions to this special issue highlighted the gaps in human trafficking research that has focused typically on sex work overlooking 'shadow' areas such as live-in domestic work, au-pairs turned into slaves, and pointed to the gaps in national and European anti-trafficking legislation. Papers in this special issue showed how migrant domestic and care work is part and parcel of welfare systems in the ageing European societies and analysed both sociologically and legally the case of trafficking in domestic work. The findings highlighted how loose conditions surrounding domestic and care work in private homes can lead to vulnerability and severe exploitation. Indeed we could speak of a 'slippery slope' where migrant live-in workers are not aware of their rights and families who employ them are not aware of their obligations while the state fails both to monitor and control this sizeable labour market sector. Thus extra working hours and low payment, may slowly become no payment at all, restriction of one's privacy and liberty, severe physical and emotional abuse, thus raising a case of trafficking rather than simple exploitation.

Broadening the finance options available and accessible to SMEs is a key challenge for policy makers in the quest for fostering their development and sustaining the most dynamic enterprises, in a credit constrained environment. It also represents a long-term challenge to improving the SMEs' capital structure and investment capacity, and reducing their over-reliance - and vulnerability - to the traditional lending channels. 446. The OECD-wide project on New Approaches to Economic Challenges (NAEC), presented at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in May 2014, underscores the need for the financial system to return to fulfilling its essential role of intermediation and providing the necessary capital for productive activities (OECD, 2014e). The present report provides an overview of alternative instruments for SME external finance over the broad risk/return spectrum and suggests that there exist opportunities to tap increasingly complex and interconnected financial markets to service the needs of a highly heterogeneous SME sector. The report highlights an increasing range of financing options for the different needs of SMEs over their life cycle, although some of these options are still at an early stage of development or, in their current form, are accessible only to a small share of the SME population.

Little more than 20 years later, the industry was generating more than US$12.5 billion in export revenue.

Considerably more than half of the per capita Footprint originates through carbon dioxide emissions, i.e., through the energy used for transportation, manufacturing and heating. A great potential for energy efficiency can be deduced from these numbers. For instance: the Footprint of a normal Berlin rental property could be reduced by approximately four global hectares by insulating its facades. That is an area the size of the Nicolas Lake in the district of Zehlendorf - for one single house. Comparing the results for different forms of transportation is especially compelling. Someone who uses the subway to get to work requires 200 times less area than someone who sits alone in his car.

Where health services are available, certain migrant groups may find it difficult to express symptomology and understand treatment instructions due to language barriers.

Improved processing methods for the optimization, sensory profiling, packaging, and shelf-life testing of these peanut-based products were standardized with assistance from the U.S. Project Investigator. Collaborating scientists, industry groups, and micro/small business entrepreneurs, who were mainly women, were trained successfully on these processes. These techniques are already adopted by the Philippine participating institutions. A successful effort was carried out to transfer to the Philippine food industry and to Cooperatives and Grassroots Business Organizations (micro-and small-scale enterprises) the improved post-harvest processing and packaging technologies. This included the Peanut CRSP developed manual sorting technology that significantly reduced aflatoxin content of peanut-based products. The Philippine food industry groups, including factory workers and managers, have been trained on the application of the technology. An EEP member visited the manufacturing facilities of the partner food companies to discuss with the managers their experiences in collaborating with Peanut CRSP, which they indicated as very positive."

Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times , or of different resources within the same area .	Type D: Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities. This type includes two main subsets: (1) indigenous peoples' areas and territories established and run by indigenous peoples and (2) community conserved areas established and run by local communities. The subsets, which may not be neatly separated, apply to both sedentary and mobile peoples and communities. IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules. These can be relatively complex. For instance, land and/or sea resources may be collectively owned and managed while other resources may be managed individually or on a clan basis. Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times, or of different resources within the same area. Rules generally intertwine with cultural and spiritual values. The customary rules and organizations managing natural resources often possess no statutory legal recognition or sanctioning power. In other cases, however, indigenous peoples and/or local communities are fully recognised as the legitimate authority in charge of state-listed protected areas or have legal title to the land, water or resources. Whatever the structure, the governance arrangements require IUCN recognises four broad types of governance of protected areas, any of which can be associated with any management objective: A. Governance by government B. Shared governance C. Private governance D. Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities 3. Governance that the area under the control of indigenous peoples and/or local communities has identifiable institutions and regulations that are responsible for achieving the protected area objectives.

Wage employment is created in large numbers, providing opportunities for rural migrants, and cushioning social tensions at a time of rapid social change. In Bangladesh, the expansion of the light manufacturing sector has allowed for the integration of young women into the labor market, at a time of falling fertility rates.

Cotton and cashew producers make most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive employment. An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Vegetable production is also highly labor intensive, but its potential has so far not been fully exploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but scope for improvement remains.

Introduction The world has a large infrastructure gap constraining trade , openness and future prosperity .	"This report explores and quantifies parts of the BRI strategy, the impact on other BRI-participating economies and some of the implications for OECD countries. It reproduces Chapter 2 from the 2018 edition of the OECD Business and Financial Outlook. 1. Introduction The world has a large infrastructure gap constraining trade, openness and future prosperity. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) are working hard to help close this gap. Most recently China has commenced a major global effort to bolster this trend, a plan known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China and economies that have signed co-operation agreements with China on the BRI (henceforth BRI-participating economies1) have been rising as a share of the world economy. The BRI is overseen by the ""Leading Group"" for promoting its work hosted by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) which oversees and coordinates all BRI projects (including inter alia with the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), and the Development Research Centre of the State Council (DRC)).2 BRI investment projects are estimated to add over USD 1 trillion of outward funding for foreign infrastructure over the 10-year period from 2017.3 While new vehicles have been formed to help with the financing, such as the Silk Road Fund, most of the Chinese funding for these projects will actually come from state-directed development and commercial banks. China is also supporting a multilateral approach to investment including MDBs and private-public partnerships (see Xi, J., 2017a, page 5)."

In the eighteenth century , the French began to use it widely as a flavoring for confectionaries and ice , and also as a scent for perfumes and tobacco .	"Plain Vanilla Vanilla was completely unknown to the Old World prior to 1492, but despite having little nutritional importance, it has become so widespread and so common that in English its name is used as an adjective to refer to anything that is ""plain, ordinary, or conventional."" Vanilla comes from the tropical forests of eastern and southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America. It is from the fruit of Vanilla planifolia, the only species of the orchid family that produces edible fruit. Neither the vanilla flower nor its fruit, which takes the shape of a long pod, naturally has any noticeable flavor or scent. Vanilla pods must be fermented to produce the chemical compound vanillin, which gives the pods their distinctive vanilla flavor and scent (Rain, 1992, p. 37). It is unclear whether vanilla was first brought back to Spain by Cortes or another Spanish traveler. In any case, it achieved popularity quickly in Spain, where factories were using it to flavor chocolate by the second half of the sixteenth century. Like chocolate, it was considered a luxury for the wealthy. King Phillip II was known to have drunk vanilla-flavored chocolate as a nightcap. It was also quickly adopted by aristocratic circles in other parts of Europe. Queen Elizabeth I of England was also known to have been a frequent user of vanilla products (Rain, 1992, p. 40). In the eighteenth century, the French began to use it widely as a flavoring for confectionaries and ice, and also as a scent for perfumes and tobacco. French colonial islands began to attempt to systematically cultivate cuttings of the plant taken from the Americas. However, because of a lack of proper insects for pollination, initial attempts ended in failure (Bruman, 1948, pp. 371-72). It was not until after 1836, when Belgian botanist Charles Morren was able to hand-pollinate vanilla orchids, that the French were successfully cultivating plants that flowered (Morren, 1838). As shown in Panel A of Table 3, the French colonial islands of Reunion and French Polynesia and the former colonial island of Comoros continue to be large suppliers of vanilla today. Mexico also continues to be a large producer of vanilla, although its production is exceeded by Indonesia, Madagascar, and China."

The root cause of skill shortages or mismatches might not lie with the education and training system. Shortages and mismatches may instead result from wrong signals generated by market distortions and institutional failures elsewhere in the economy.

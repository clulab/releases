These are the underlying social , institutional , and economic factors that generate feedbacks determining the distribution of proximal factors and the observed heterogeneity in resilience .	"The second of these resilience assessment components identifies contextual drivers of resilience. These are the underlying social, institutional, and economic factors that generate feedbacks determining the distribution of proximal factors and the observed heterogeneity in resilience. The vulnerability literature emphasizes the importance of contextual factors in determining the differential impacts of natural hazards, most notably referred to as ""root causes"" within the pressure and release model (Wisner et al. 2004). Within a resilience framing, contextual drivers of resilience interact with proximal factors, as well as contemporary characteristics of the farming system generating feedbacks that create path-dependency in the trajectory of farm resilience. This is exemplified by Enfors (2013) and Enfors and Gordon (2008) who use evidence from drought prone catchments in Tanzania to show that institutional change, drought, and population growth reinforce a cycle of ecosystem degradation, low crop yields, and poverty. They argue that destabilization of these feedbacks is necessary for alternative development trajectories to take place. Awareness of ultimate contextual, social, and institutional factors is important for realizing sustained impact from social protection interventions; this is encapsulated in the concept of transformative social protection (Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux 2011). Bene et al. (2012) draws upon this to argue that awareness of these same factors are important for building resilience to shocks (among certain groups). Inclusive and effective institutions, social capital, and equity have been reported as key characteristics of climate resilient systems (Bahadur et al. 2013)."	These are the underlying social, institutional, and economic factors that generate feedbacks determining the distribution of proximal factors and the observed heterogeneity in resilience.

Individual scientists from IRRI and other institutions organize and conduct research driven by a particular theme or set of research tools .	Individual scientists from IRRI and other institutions organize and conduct research driven by a particular theme or set of research tools. Two networks are currently convened by IRRI: * Asian Rice Biotechnology Network (ARBN), established at IRRI in 1993 to provide a vehicle for collaborative research in rice biotechnology with universities and rice breeding institutes of the Asian countries. ARBN, through its training and collaborative research activities, is providing a unique mechanism for national research institutions to gain access to relevant knowledge and biotechnology tools. The ultimate goal is to assist them in applying biotechnology to meet their own national needs in rice varietal improvement. * Hybrid Rice Network, which aims to speed up development and use of hybrid rice technology in Asia. Current activities are in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, in collaboration with FAO, the Asia Pacific Seed Association, and China. The network has contributed significantly to the development and promotion of hybrid rice technology.

Other crops such as tomatoes , cacao , and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories , but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste .	"The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history. Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

How does the Ecological Footprint account for the use of fossil fuels? Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are extracted from the Earth's crust rather than produced by current ecosystems. When burning this fuel, carbon dioxide is produced. In order to avoid carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere, in accordance with the goal of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, two options exist: a) human technological sequestration, such as deep well injection; or b) natural sequestration. Natural sequestration corresponds to the biocapacity required to absorb and store the CO2 not sequestered by humans, less than the amount absorbed by the oceans. This is the Footprint for fossil fuels. Currently, negligible amounts of CO2 are sequestered through human technological processes.

These criteria are not mutually exclusive.

India was the pioneer, but other countries--Brazil, Chile, China, and Malaysia, to name a few--have also seized the opportunity.72 The obvious winners of job migration are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered service jobs have migrated. This migration, along with the transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and higher living standards. The hidden winners of job migration are consumers worldwide. The improved international division of labor increases the availability of goods and services and enhances the possibility of gaining from trade. The clear losers are those who have seen their jobs disappear because of the declining competitiveness of their industries and services. Among the losers, many skilled workers find comparable jobs without a substantial loss in salary, but oth- and expertise. Social effects are more mixed. On the positive side, migration connects people from different cultures in ways bound to widen their horizons. On the negative side, the separation from family and friends can be a source of distress and isolation. Migration may also bring racial prejudice and heighten social tensions in host countries, especially when migrants are secluded in segregated occupations or neighborhoods, preventing their integration in society.

Consumption is seasonal taking place during the first six months after harvest .	Project UFL16P - 199 - Farm machineries. Prototypes of small-scale machinery for digging, threshing, and sorting peanut have been developed with support from Peanut CRSP. The use of these machineries was demonstrated to farmers during field days. Peanut programs. A National Peanut Program and a Peanut Seed Production Program are in place due to the support of the Peanut CRSP to Bolivia. The government has recognized ANAPO as the national reference institution for peanut research and development. It has developed a private Peanut Seed System that is patterned after its Seed Production System for soybeans, wheat, sunflower, and wheat of ANAPO. Seed, other agrochemical inputs, and technical advice are provided by ANAPO to producers at planting time and paid for during harvest at cost plus a minimal fee. Consumers' survey. A consumers' survey was carried out in 2002, which showed that the processing industry is not developed, with only 2-3 processors in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. Peanut soup, preferred by 70% of the respondents, is generally produced in the home using traditional recipes. Other products are roasted and salted peanuts. Consumption is seasonal taking place during the first six months after harvest. The result of this survey is critical in understanding the local market potential and initiating activities in processing and utilization for domestic and export markets. Information on consumers' preferences in the target exporting countries would also be useful.	Consumption is seasonal taking place during the first six months after harvest.

This Results Report 2019, the third for the current strategy, shows that GPE is making important headway toward improving learning for all children. More children are entering and completing school across partner countries, and there is encouraging progress in learning. Partners are working together to build a strong and sustainable foundation for learning, with improvements in sector planning and increased investments in data and learning assessment systems. Going forward, to be transformative these efforts need to be bolstered by consistent and inclusive monitoring of progress, as well as increased and better use of existing national systems. Inequity is a global challenge that goes beyond our sector and requires significant attention. Education gaps based on wealth and geographic location are still wide but narrowing, while the gap between girls and boys remains steady. This report provides valuable insight into where partners must focus resources to go that extra mile to make sure education systems meet the needs of the most marginalized children and break down the barriers keeping them out of school or not learning. Focusing on those left furthest behind is not just the right thing to do, but also the best way to improve overall learning outcomes and reduce inefficiency.

Yet road and rail transport infrastructure in Coted'Ivoire is inefficient and expensive , contributed to by entrenched monopoly , inefficient quota system , and pervasive roadblocks and corruption demands in the north such as along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor ( WorldBank 2014 , 2015b ) .	In the context of Coted'Ivoire, two factors stand out as possible constraints to output demand growth: transport infrastructure and logistics, and firm capabilities. As in most countries, rapid expansion of demand is most likely to occur in tradable sectors. Coted'Ivoire has an advantage over many other landlocked countries but its logistic performance index (LPI) is barely above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. The cost of export and import based on Doing Business data is inexplicably more expensive than landlocked countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali.105 For smaller firms in particular, reaching the regional market might be an important 104 Doing Business data on Minimum wage/Ratio of minimum wage to value added per employee: Kenya: 269.4/1.4, CI: 119.0/0.5, Senegal: 185.6/1.1, Cameroon: 70.3/0.3, Burkina Faso: 107.9/1, Sri Lanka: 79.3/0.2, Ghana: 60.1/0.3, Mali:62/0.5, Vietnam: 142.5/0.6 105 See http://www.doingbusiness.org/Custom-Query/cote-divoire channel for export. Yet road and rail transport infrastructure in Coted'Ivoire is inefficient and expensive, contributed to by entrenched monopoly, inefficient quota system, and pervasive roadblocks and corruption demands in the north such as along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor (WorldBank 2014, 2015b). Successful demand accumulation also requires a certain degree of firm capabilities. As argued earlier, the fact that Ivorian firms are significantly less able to survive in sectors with a high rate of foreign entry suggests the need to improve capabilities for domestic firms. These include, beyond better access to finance, other complementary inputs such as business services support, access to information about foreign markets, and public inputs such as quality standards. The next section discusses some of the policy tools toward this goal.

Improved rice gene pools The objective of this work is to increase rice genetic diversity and enhance gene pools for higher and more stable yields. This research has five steps: 1. Improved germplasm, which involves identifying progenitors for crossing, evaluating segregating material, and carrying out yield trials. 2. Improved populations (recurrent selection), requiring evaluation/ recombination of gene pools, development of blast resistance through recurrent selection, development of indica gene pools with a higher response to anther culture, enhanced pest and disease resistance, high yield potential, and excellent quality. 3. Identification and use of genes from wild germplasm. First, useful wild germplasm and its traits are identified, followed by International rice research and development 57 interspecific crosses and the development of backcross populations. These populations undergo quantitative trait loci analysis and suitable isogenic lines are produced for release as advanced lines. Anther culture is used to speed up the process. 4. Determination of the physiological basis for yield enhancement and adaptation to abiotic stresses.

Those who sought help from the authorities after they received threats were often turned away. Sri Lanka saw a rise in Buddhist nationalist sentiment, including attacks against Christians and Muslims. The Maldives government used religion to cloak its repressive practices, including attacks against members of the opposition and plans to reintroduce the death penalty.

Field trials and workshops were held in 5 villages in 2004. The better farmers are being trained as trainers to impart knowledge to their peers. There has been a rapid shiftin training emphasis as the production has expanded. Leveraging this project the Beacon Foundation has initiated training of women's groups to process these peanuts and add value. Five village factories have been established. The technologies being promoted for production, processing, roasting and making peanut butter are labor intensive and will absorb the available labor in the region. While roasting, shelling and peanut butter making devices are available, they are undergoing continuous improvements, often with input from the locals. Processing technologies for new products yet to be selected will need to be developed and fitted to local circumstances and the peanut CRSP will be on hand to offer help in those transitions.

Priorities: Realizing the development payoffs from jobs In addition to ensuring that the fundamentals support growth and that labor policies are adequate, decision makers can help realize the development payoffs that come from jobs. Some jobs do more than others for living standards, productivity, and social cohesion. What those jobs are depends on the country context--its level of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. In some circumstances, there will be no constraints to the emergence of good jobs for development, and no specific policy will be needed. In others, governments can support the private sector in creating more of these jobs. Sometimes this can be achieved by removing constraints that impede the creation of jobs with high development payoffs. When this is not possible, policies can be more proactive and bypass the constraints, provided that the gains to society from doing so outweigh the cost. developing countries where formal sectors are small, funding these programs through general taxation is increasingly discussed,108 but any taxes create distortions.

Depending on the size of their farms and their resources, upland rice farmers use farming systems ranging from shifting to permanent cultivation. Shifting cultivation is common in Indonesia, Lao PDR, northern Thailand, and Vietnam in Asia, and in the forested areas of Latin America and West Africa. Farmers plant a rice crop alone or in association with other crops such as maize, yam, beans, cassava, or plantains. In many places, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Southwest China, and Brazil, upland rice may be intercropped with maize. In areas with sufficient rainfall, upland rice may be followed by a crop of maize, cowpea, beans, soybean, or sweet potato. In West Africa, one or more crops may be mixed with upland rice. Farmers use an area for 1-3 yr until soil fertility declines and weed and pest infestations increase. They then abandon the land and return to previously abandoned farmland or start cropping on other available fallow land. In traditional shifting cultivation systems, fallow periods were as long as 30 years. This lengthy fallow restored fertility and prevented weed seed buildup. Now, rotations in most upland areas practicing shifting cultivation have shortened to a 2-or 3-yr cycle because of increased population pressure. This has resulted in increased weed pressure and reduced soil fertility.	In West Africa, one or more crops may be mixed with upland rice.

While the shiftin the composition of the global health burden towards non-communicable diseases has been achieved in developed regions, communicable diseases, along with maternal, nutritional and neonatal conditions, continue to take a heavy toll in some developing regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania 1 WHO, 1946. And Southern Asia. Universal health coverage, which refers to systems in which all people have access to adequate health care without financial hardship and in an equitable manner, has been instituted in only some developed countries.2 Its prioritization in developing regions is likely to be based on each country's epidemiological conditions, demographics, economic resources and current state of the health system.3 Biology determines the health needs and vulnerabilities specific to women and men. It is one of the main factors behind men's increased risk for a number of health problems, their higher mortality (starting from day one and extending throughout their lives), and their shorter life expectancy.

The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country.

This report shows that a majority of countries have established legislation to protect and support maternity and paternity at work, even if those provisions do not always meet the ILO standards. One of the persistent challenges is the effective implementation of legislation to ensure that all workers are able to benefit from these essential labour rights.

Although in many countries school drop-out rates are steadily falling, they continue to be higher among girls than among boys. The reasons for the high drop-out rate among girls are poverty, early marriage, helping parents with housework and agricultural work, the distance of schools from homes, the high costs of schooling, parents' illiteracy and indifference, and the lack of a positive educational climate. Girls begin school very late and withdraw with the onset of puberty. Parents do not see the benefits of girls' education because girls are given away in marriage to serve the husband's family. Sons are given priority. In certain countries, enrolment rates for girls have actually declined despite attempts to increase them.

It relies on qualitative and quantitative analyses to identify how jobs contribute to living standards, productivity, and social cohesion. And it seeks to identify where the constraints to the creation of the jobs with the highest development payoff lie in practice. In some cases, a jobs strategy will focus on increasing female labor participation, in others on creating employment opportunities for youth, yet in others on creating a supportive environment for the creation of jobs in cities, or jobs connected to global value chains. This may not be too different from preparing a more comprehensive growth strategy, except that jobs would be center stage.

Most provide some indication of costing, and several governments have reached out to development partners for financial and technical support.

For three specific histories of child migration , see Bhabha , Kanics and Senovilla ( eds .	"Definitional confusion has long bedevilled discussion of child migration. Like the deficiencies related to data that are discussed in what follows, not all aspects of this challenge are specific to children. Facile dichotomies of forced versus economic migration are widely deployed in the migration field, and complicate the imperative of foregrounding rights considerations for vulnerable populations who may be in urgent need of protection. The dearth of child migration research from a child-rather than State-centric perspective contributes to this.11 3 For a seminal overview of the migration history of unaccompanied children, see Ressler, Boothby and Steinbock, 1998.

Because of the large variety of relevant situations, child migrants are now commonly referred to as ""children on the move"", a phrase that has the advantage of not precluding a transition from one migrant category to another, but the disadvantage of obscuring the challenges arising after settlement."

The IUCN guidelines note that category II should ' provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual , scientific , educational , recreational and visitor opportunities ' .	The park's multiple international designations--World Heritage, Biosphere Reserve, Ramsar--together with the fact that it includes Korea's highest mountain make the park a major tourist destination. Hallasan is also being considered for Geopark status. This international recognition reinforces the biodiversity and geodiversity values of the park. Management is clearly strongly oriented toward the protection of these values. As the objectives are primarily aimed at conservation and recreation, use of category II seems to be justified. IUCN WCPA Best Practice Guidance on Recognising Protected Areas and Assigning Management Categories and Governance Types Recommendations Although the physical characteristics of the park coupled with the overall management objectives of Hallasan conform to category II assignment, it was considered that there were opportunities to further adapt management to strengthen the objectives of category II assignment. The IUCN guidelines note that category II should 'provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities'. The development of the visitor centre, ecoguides and trail management are important steps towards this goal; however, the decline in visitor satisfaction following the closing of several major trails (due to track deterioration) and lack of visitor interpretation about the ecosystem functions of the park should be addressed. The strong regulatory regime for visitors is commendable in terms of protection, however, risks losing public support. Opportunities could be explored to provide limited and guided tours to more sensitive areas and to enjoy the park at different times of the day--for example, sunset walks or evening walks may be feasible without damaging sensitive environments.

Part 2 Ecological accounting humans and wild living plants and animals will increase. The question will become: Who gets the fish - the sea lion or the human? Can declining population trends in species be reversed? If we wanted to put a full stop to human activities that lead to endangered and extinct species, we would need to make drastic changes in our living habits. It would likely require taking portions of land used by humans, and returning them to their natural state. It would also require changing our eating habits significantly. We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions, and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort. Biological diversity is not equally distributed throughout the world. Many biodiversity hotspots lie in Central America and western Amazonia, in the Cape area of South Africa, and in the mountains and plains of East Africa. Other regions rich in biodiversity include the coastal regions and islands of the Mediterranean, Southwest China, and the bordering areas from Burma to Vietnam. Large parts of Madagascar also belong to this list, as do numerous islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. When faced with the extinction of valuable biodiversity, is it sufficient to view the Earth exclusively as potentially productive area for humans? Or is our planet more than a source of raw materials for human consumption and a carbon dioxide sink for human waste? To enable sustainable development, scientists, politicians and members of civil society will have to take action, individually and collectively, to protect the Earth's diversity of ecosystems, genes and species, while maintaining a high quality of life for humans.

It is crucial for such states to make efficient investments in infrastructure in order to minimize the growing global demand for biocapacity. In times of increasing scarcity of raw materials and ecological services, growing deficits will prove to be disadvantageous.

This group includes both resource-rich countries, such as the Central African Republic, as well as resource-poor countries like Bangladesh.

Improvement of research facilities and human capital development would ensure sustainability of the research initiatives supported by Peanut CRSP in the host countries. There has been leveraging of funding from host country governments and others resulting from Peanut CRSP commitment, another sustainability factor.

Jobs are transformational PART1 Introduction to Part 1 Economic development is about improvements in living standards supported by productivity growth. It also involves social change associated with urbanization, integration in the world economy, and the drive toward gender equality. All of these transformations are related to jobs. The development process is about some jobs becoming better and others disappearing, about people taking jobs and changing jobs, and about jobs migrating to other places within and across countries. Development often entails the movement of labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly subsistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and mostly market-oriented activities. This movement transforms the lives of families and communities, the organization of firms, and the norms and values of societies. It can boost productivity and improve living standards and also affect the cohesiveness of society. Jobs are thus a key driver of development. * Living standards: Jobs provide earnings opportunities to lift people out of poverty, raise their consumption, and contribute to individual well-being more broadly. * Productivity: Through job creation and destruction within sectors and reallocations across sectors and countries, jobs are also at the root of economic growth. * Social cohesion: Jobs define who people are in many ways; by shaping values and be-DEVELOPMENT JOBS LIVING STANDARDS PRODUCTIVITY SOCIAL COHESION haviors, they can influence trust and civic engagement.

Software relates to the people within the system. The performance of health systems depends on the behaviour and decisions of the people within it, which are shaped by both tangible software (their capacity and the formal processes by which people act) and intangible software (the informal rules, values, and norms that shape relationships and interactions among actors, and which are themselves shaped by the socio-political context in which the health system operates) (Sheikh et al., 2011).

In West and Central Africa , organized crime continues to contribute to social and economic costs by increasing drug trafficking and addiction and by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of comparatively few well-armed criminals .	299. Africa continues to be one of the main transit areas for drug trafficking. West Africa is regularly used by traffickers to smuggle cocaine and other drugs into Europe. Furthermore, North Africa remains a primary source of drugs entering Europe, while East Africa is increasingly being used as a trafficking hub for Afghan heroin destined for Europe. The latter development is evidenced by the fact that East African countries and certain European countries have reported annual growth in seizures of heroin of African origin. This may be a reason for the increased abuse of heroin in East Africa. 300. Traffickers in search of new illicit markets for cocaine and heroin have targeted the nascent middle class in certain African countries, such as Benin, which has been used as a transit country for many decades, and Namibia, a transit country that is becoming a consumer country. Drug trafficking in West Africa may have an impact on the abuse of certain types of drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine, heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants, in the subregion. 301. The increase in drug trafficking has been accompanied not only by growing illicit drug use, especially among younger people, but also by increasing activities of organized criminal groups. In West and Central Africa, organized crime continues to contribute to social and economic costs by increasing drug trafficking and addiction and by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of comparatively few well-armed criminals. 302. Although the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has made efforts to counter the impact of drug trafficking and abuse in West Africa, there has been an overall increase in drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe using Africa as a transit area. The increase in illicit drug use in West Africa has resulted in challenges related to security, treatment and negative health and social consequences of that drug use. 303. According to South African law enforcement authorities, drug trafficking organizations from China and the Balkans have established a significant presence in Southern Africa. In addition to importing drugs directly into Southern Africa, drug trafficking organizations ship drugs to Maputo, and from there the drugs are transported by truck to South Africa.	In West and Central Africa, organized crime continues to contribute to social and economic costs by increasing drug trafficking and addiction and by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of comparatively few well-armed criminals.

The participants were trained on manual sorting technology and rapid detection of aflatoxin in peanut. They were also trained on processing methods for six peanut products: Ground-roasted peanut (new), Oil-roasted peanut (new), Peanut butter (new), Peanut bar (toob-tab, traditional), Fried peanut patty (traditional), and Honey-roasted peanut (new).

Local customs, such as religious practices or the use of leisure time, often determine whether a product is marketable. The sensory impression a product makes, such as taste, smell, or a visual effect, may also be a critical factor. For example, Japanese consumers tend to prefer certain kinds of packaging, leading many U.S. companies to redesign cartons and packages that are destined for the Japanese market.

Thus , the GPI presents an innovative index , and the data from which it is constructed allow detailed analyses of gender differentials in empowerment in agriculture .	A vital and unprecedented contribution of the WEAI is the GPI, which reflects gender parity between the primary male and primary female living in the same household. This index provides a finegrained understanding of gender differentials in empowerment. From the same micro data, it is possible to compare the gap by other variables, such as age differences, marital status, household types, main modes of production, household income, educational status of male or female, and so on. It is also possible to study the gap between average achievements among disempowered women and men rather than looking at the household level.

In urban areas, retail activities, personal services (hairdressing), and construction activities are relatively more common than in rural areas. In rural areas, activities involving the transformation of agricultural products or selling food are relatively more common (Figure4.3).75 Almost all nonagricultural household enterprises are informal. More than 90 percent are not registered in any way. An earlier informal survey conducted in Abidjan also found similar results (AGEPE 2011). In addition, more than 60 percent of nonagricultural household enterprises report not keeping any books, with just 14.4 percent undertaking formal bookkeeping (Figure4.4). The degree of informality is also evident through the fact that 68.1 percent of household enterprise owners are not subject to formal fiscal regimes. Only some 5.0 percent are subject to regime reel, and 27 percent pay lump-sum taxes (Figure4.5). That being said, most microenterprises do need to pay local authorities for permits (patente) to operate.

Bangladesh has benefited from over a decade of support to PFM reform. In an effort to record the achievements and challenges of this process, DFID, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, undertook an impact assessment of PFM reform in 2007.68 Part of this analysis was carried out by applying the PEFA methodology. The PEFA scores highlight an important conclusion. Whereas clear improvements in technical capacity have been achieved in some areas (e.g. multi-annual and financial reporting), major bottlenecks persist in transparency and accountability. Progress in tax reform, internal and external audit as well as parliamentary scrutiny has been very limited, with hardly any improvements in the PEFA scores between 1992 and 2006. Also the budget process is political in nature, and further progress in capacity building is constrained by a number of political economy and institutional factors. Weak domestic accountability has led to a lack of challenge through the PFM reform process to vested interests. Major stumbling blocks are that the constituency for change has been limited to the Ministry of Finance, the fact that the audit and accounts cadres are not separated, and the practice of the Ministry of Establishment to rotate staff very frequently across the entire administration, often based on party lines.

Sadly, these perceptions declined the most in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that already struggles to better utilize its natural assets.

Across survey years and labor input variables (family and hired), rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective. Cotton and cashew producers make the most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Finally, consistent with findings from other countries (for example, Damiani (2003) for Brazil), vegetable production is also highly labor intensive. Its potential has so far been largely left unexploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but much scope for improvement remains.

Countries also need to be aware of the differentiated needs of female and male health workers and ensure they are motivated and supported through occupational health programmes , remuneration , insurance , childcare if needed , and psychosocial support .	Effective response requires a strong, committed, well-distributed, and skilled workforce that is supported, protected, recognised, and encouraged, particularly given the emotional strain during emergencies. Support is particularly important for female health workers, who make up an estimated 70% of the world's global health and social sector workforce (WEF, 2020). Many often have to balance increased family pressures as well as the increased workload related to pandemic response (O'Donnell et al., 2020). In addition, their safety may be compromised by a combination of high-risk environments and a lack of PPE (WEF, 2020). For COVID-19, requirements include provision for surge capacity, adjusting roles and actions as needed, and ongoing capacity building. Countries also need to be aware of the differentiated needs of female and male health workers and ensure they are motivated and supported through occupational health programmes, remuneration, insurance, childcare if needed, and psychosocial support. This can promote the institutional trust that is crucial to the performance of the health system.

Becoming part of a network can help secure rights and ensure continuity of livelihoods and traditions .	In reality the recognition by a protected area management authority of protected areas owned/managed by indigenous communities is often linked to a community's response to an external threat to their traditional ownership/management. Becoming part of a network can help secure rights and ensure continuity of livelihoods and traditions. This process of 'formal' recognition can simplify the process of ensuring a site meets the definition of a protected area, assigning the category and having the site recorded within national and international data on protected area. The Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) of Australia, for example, used the categories system from the onset; the advantages of this were perceived by all parties. As IUCN recorded in a review of the use of the categories in 2004, 'Indigenous groups ... liked the idea of adopting an internationally recognised system because they felt it reinforced their status as legitimate protected area managers and thus engaged them into an internationally significant agenda, something they have struggled to achieve in Australia. From other stakeholders' perspective (i.e. government and NGOs) the IUCN category system gave the IPA concept more credibility and parity with the mainstream protected area system and so their criticisms were somewhat diminished. From the perspective of the Commonwealth government, who are the funders and promoters of the initiative, it also gave greater confidence that IPAs were worth investing in with scarce conservation dollars' (Bishop et al., 2004, pages 142-143). Other examples of the use of the protected areas concept to maintain traditional human societies can be found in Stolton and Dudley, 2010.

Sacred sites may exist in more or less natural ecosystems , cultural landscapes or managed landscapes and when they occur in protected areas they need to be fully incorporated into management strategies in cooperation with the relevant faith and community groups .	Many protected areas contain sites of importance to one, and sometimes more than one faith or spiritual value systems, including both sacred natural sites and built monuments such as monasteries, temples, shrines and pilgrimage trails. Even in systems of protected areas in the most secularized countries of Europe, which were established using only ecological criteria, it is estimated that between 20-35 percent include significant cultural or spiritual values. There are countries and territories where all nature is sacred and protected areas can form smaller entities as part of larger sacred landscapes. Managers have to ensure that these spiritual values are protected alongside natural heritage. However, sacred sites are currently not effectively reflected in protected area designations and management plans, and existing policy and legal frameworks do not adequately support sacred (natural) sites. There is sound and widespread evidence that sacred natural sites have been providing effective biodiversity conservation, often for hundreds of years. Sacred sites may exist in more or less natural ecosystems, cultural landscapes or managed landscapes and when they occur in protected areas they need to be fully incorporated into management strategies in cooperation with the relevant faith and community groups. Some examples are given in Table 13. 6.

"Argentina remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2018 Special 301 Report. The situation for innovators in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors presents significant challenges. First, the scope of patentable subject matter is significantly restricted under Argentine law. Second, there is not adequate protection against unfair commercial use and unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test and other data submitted to the government in conjunction with its lengthy marketing approval process. Finally, the patent pendency backlog continues to be excessive. In addition, the absence of sustained enforcement efforts - including under the criminal laws - sufficient to have a deterrent effect, coupled with judicial inefficiency and outdated intellectual property (IP) laws, diminishes the competitiveness of U.S. IP-intensive industries in Argentina. During 2018, Argentina made progress in tackling the problem of street vendors selling counterfeit products within the City of Buenos Aires. Authorities continue to take action, including seizures of illicit goods, to dismantle organized crime operations in ""La Salada"", one of South America's largest black markets for counterfeit and pirated goods. The existing legislative regime and lack of enforcement hinder the ability of rights holders, law enforcement, and prosecutors to halt, through legal action, the growth of illegal online markets. The United States will continue to engage Argentina on these and other IP issues."

The strongest demand for English speakers comes from foreign banks and investment companies , MNCs and public institutions .	For 24 of the 30 companies interviewed, English is their primary business language, used for internal and external communication. For the remaining seven companies, Bengali is the primary language. However, for these companies English is required as a second language, and on average 41% of employees speak English. All of these factors underline the importance of English in the workplace and for the economy in general, and show why a high proportion of the population want to improve their English skills to the highest possible degree. The strongest demand for English speakers comes from foreign banks and investment companies, MNCs and public institutions. Only nine companies would consider employing candidates with only a basic level English, while the remaining companies seek to recruit employees with intermediate or good skill levels. This underlines the fact that Bangladeshi professionals with a strong command of English have more and better opportunities to get good jobs in private businesses.

The early native inhabitants of the Great Lakes region increased the natural production of wild rice by rolling seeds into a ball of clay and dropping the seeded balls into the water.

Resources : This dimension concerns ownership of , access to , and decision-making power about productive resources such as land , livestock , agricultural equipment , consumer durables , and credit .	The early literature on empowerment typically used one global measure for empowerment. For example, parents' education was often used to measure agency or decision-making within the household (Alkire 2007); husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981). However, it is possible that agency differs across different spheres of life and can exist simultaneously in different ways. For example, a person can be fully employed as a wife and mother, excluded from the labor force by social conventions, and recently empowered to vote by political processes. Because such distinctions have policy relevance, it is important to identify and compare agency achievements in different domains rather than in one alone (Alkire 2007, 166). Because agency and empowerment are experienced with different tasks and can be described and measured with different domains, Alkire (2005) suggests that most measures of agency and empowerment should be domain specific. For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1. Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment. 2. Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit. 3. Income: This dimension concerns sole or joint control over the use of income and expenditures. 4. Leadership: This dimension concerns leadership in the community, here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public. 5. Time: This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities.

It will also be instrumental to the development of an INRM framework and curriculum for farmer learning for inland valleys in West Africa .	Inland valleys have very complex, dynamic, and diverse human, social, natural, and physical dimensions and interconnections. This complexity needs to be understood to determine options for improved and integrated natural resource management. Given the diversity of inland-valley ecosystems, a bottom-up social learning process will be critical. Only then can sustainable and lasting impact on food security in the region be achieved. A participatory learning and action research approach among inlandvalley development stakeholders (farmers, change agents, extension, research) at the grassroots level is required. This will help build bridges between indigenous knowledge and scientific expertise, and stimulate the formation of networks between farmers and other inlandvalley development stakeholders. It will also be instrumental to the development of an INRM framework and curriculum for farmer learning for inland valleys in West Africa. WARDA is using integrated rice management as an entry point to INRM for inland valleys. A complete curriculum has been developed, containing a facilitators' manual and a technical manual dealing with all management interventions from land preparation to harvest and postharvest issues. The Inland Valley Consortium (10 West and Central African countries hosted by WARDA that focus on intensified but sustainable use of inland valleys) forms the foundation of the inland-valley research and development platform that is being built at regional and national levels.

Analysis of this nature enables interventions to be targeted to increase the resistance of farmers to hazards , e.g ., flood resistant seeds ( Dar et al. 2013 ) or enable ex post coping ( e.g ., Akter et al. 2016 ) .	Investigations have been made into the use of resilience as a concept to guide development. These studies have focused on the following: identifying which economic units are or are not resilient; the differential impacts of shocks on these units; and the responses of different economic units to these shocks (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Akter and Mallick 2013, Constas et al. 2014, Alfani et al. 2015, Jain et al. 2015, Cisse and Barrett 2016). Analysis of this nature enables interventions to be targeted to increase the resistance of farmers to hazards, e.g., flood resistant seeds (Dar et al. 2013) or enable ex post coping (e.g., Akter et al. 2016). Our work builds upon the arguments of Bene et al. (2016a) and Enfors (2013) in highlighting the importance of contextual factors to explain resilience in farmers. Our analysis strongly suggests that a range of interacting contextual factors prevent the emergence of resilient, high-return rice cropping livelihoods. Agricultural interventions need to take into account these contextual factors to shift rice cropping onto a trajectory toward resilience. Our context-based analysis shows how rice cultivation and the prevailing social norms, formal institutions, and economy interact to shape coping capacity and the distribution of resilience. We argue that context based studies that explain how resilience occurs and resilience measurement studies that monitor economic units pre-and postshock are complementary. Contextbased studies can explain why differential levels of postdisaster resilience occur. Such complementary analysis will likely lead to more sustainable and effective resilience building interventions.	Analysis of this nature enables interventions to be targeted to increase the resistance of farmers to hazards, e.g., flood resistant seeds (Dar et al. 2013) or enable ex post coping (e.g., Akter et al. 2016).

These objectives are normally specified at national level in relevant legislation or other governance system ( e.g ., traditional authority for community conserved areas ) which provides overall direction for management of the site .	The second looks more deeply at whether these objectives have been delivered in practice. These objectives are normally specified at national level in relevant legislation or other governance system (e.g., traditional authority for community conserved areas) which provides overall direction for management of the site. For example, designation as a category II protected area means that the area should be managed primarily for biodiversity conservation with no, or very limited, extractive use of resources. In some cases, managers may have difficulty in managing the site in strict accordance with these objectives. It has been assumed that the results of assessments of management effectiveness should not be used as a basis for allocating or changing the category to which a protected area is assigned. So, for example, the appropriate response to an evaluation of management effectiveness that reveals a failure to control illegal resource exploitation in a category II protected area is not to change the site to category V (which allows for a level of sustainable resource use) but rather, to seek to adapt management to achieve more effectively the legally specified management objectives.

The quality of legal infrastructure and the strength of legal institutions is also robust .	The top 20 economies share a number of international good practices. In the area of starting a business, 13 of these economies have at least one procedure that can be completed online in 0.5 days. The electricity distribution utilities in all but one of the top 20 economies use automated tools, allowing for faster, more efficient and more secure restoration of service during power outages. In the areas of construction and land administration, in all top 20 economies mandatory inspections are always done in practice during the construction of a warehouse, and the majority have comprehensive geographic coverage. The quality of legal infrastructure and the strength of legal institutions is also robust. In all top 20 economies, for example, the insolvency framework stipulates that a creditor has the right to object to decisions accepting or rejecting creditors' claims, providing strong safeguards to creditors in insolvency proceedings. Court automation is prevalent, and judgments are enforced twice as fast on average (95.6 days) than in the remaining economies (200 days). These economies also have strong disclosure requirements in place to prevent the misuse of corporate assets by directors for personal gain. Most mandate that a shareholder must immediately disclose transactions--as well as any conflicts of interest--to other shareholders. To date, no economy has reached the best regulatory performance on all indicators; every economy can progress further by learning from the experience of others.

Recent developments in the rice sector The agricultural sector ( including forestry and fisheries ) contributed approximately one-sixth of GDP in 2000 , with rice production responsible for about one-fourth of this contribution .	Recent developments in the rice sector The agricultural sector (including forestry and fisheries) contributed approximately one-sixth of GDP in 2000, with rice production responsible for about one-fourth of this contribution. Rice constitutes nearly 40% of total crop area harvested and is the country's staple food, accounting for slightly more than half of caloric intake and nearly half of protein intake. Rice accounts for 20% of total expenditures for the poorest quarter of the urban population. Even in rural areas, many poor people are net consumers of rice, since 45% of rural households on Java do not own any land and another 20% own less than 0.25 ha. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Indonesia was the world's largest rice importer, often importing one-fourth of total supplies on the world market. From 1967 to 1986, however, total rice production tripled, probably the most extraordinary growth rate of staple food production in human history, and self-sufficiency was achieved by the mid-1980s. This rapid production growth was achieved through the adoption of modern high-yielding varieties and fertilizers by farmers. Adoption of these varieties was greatly facilitated by government programs such as fertilizer subsidies and rice price stabilization around the long-term trend of world prices. Large investments in rural infrastructure such as irrigation, roads, and schools also played a critical role.

Smaller cohorts of young people could reduce innovative capacity. Disability rates increase in older age groups and thus further affect the labor supply in aging populations.111 Understanding how aggregate savings will be affected is also important, given that savings drive investment, growth, and job creation. Savings typically decline among older age groups. This decline could be offset if young people were to build up additional buffers to support their longer life spans, especially if public retirement schemes prove unsustainable or are absent. Expenditure patterns also vary with age. The rapid rise in the long-term care industry in high-income countries is an example. In the United States, the industry now counts more than 3 million formal jobs, and an estimated 10 million Americans 50 years or older (roughly one-quarter of this Diverse jobs agendas 215 rial hardship for elderly people.

A somewhat similar picture is found in developed regions, although communicable diseases are much less prominent. Only 19 per cent of deaths between 1 month and 5 years of age are due to infectious diseases. In all older age groups (after age 5), the share of infectious diseases among all causes of death hardly exceeds 10 per cent.

While the intensification of crop-based agriculture has been associated with a significant increase in the use of inorganic fertilizer, the application of fertilizer per hectare is far lower in Sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region of the world. One of the major reasons is the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices. Fertilizer prices are usually two to three times higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and Latin America because of poor infrastructure and trade logistics.13 Another major constraint on fertilizer application is the lack of credit for smallholders, given that land ownership titles are seldom secured and hence cannot be used as collateral.14 Therefore, productivity growth in agriculture also requires a favorable investment climate including improved access to infrastructure and credit.15 troducing new varieties and so tend not to make the effort.

Doing Business provides a narrow perspective on the infrastructure challenges that firms face , particularly in the developing world , through these indicators .	The focus is deliberately narrow even within the relatively small set of indicators included in Doing Business. The time and cost required for the logistical process of exporting and importing goods is captured in the trading across borders indicators, for example, but they do not measure the cost of tariffs or of international transport. Doing Business provides a narrow perspective on the infrastructure challenges that firms face, particularly in the developing world, through these indicators. It does not address the extent to which inadequate roads, rail, ports and communications may add to firms' costs and undermine competitiveness (except to the extent that the trading across borders indicators indirectly measure the quality of ports and border connections). Similar to the indicators on trading across borders, all aspects of commercial legislation are not covered by those on starting a business or protecting minority investors. Given that Doing Business measures only a few features of each area that it covers, business regulatory reforms should not focus only on these narrow areas and should be evaluated within a broader perspective.

First, the country context must be assessed and the particular jobs challenge or challenges it faces must be identified. The second step is examining whether the jobs with the highest development payoffs are really the most attractive to individuals or the most profitable for firms. When incentives are aligned--with the individual and social value of jobs equal--there should be no shortage of good jobs for development and intervention is not needed. The third step is determining whether the institutional failures and market imperfections leading to misaligned incentives can be pinpointed or not. The fourth step is understanding whether politically feasible reforms can remove or correct those failures and imperfections. If not, the last step involves assessing whether incentives should be realigned through other policies (figure 9.4).

Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries , especially in highervalue-added export sectors , are also good for development .	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context.

Factors that contribute to differences in cancer incidence and mortality across countries include variations in age structure; prevalence of risk factors; and availability and use of preventive services, early detection tests (e.g., mammography), and high-quality treatment (mortality). Many of these factors are strongly influenced by level of development. For example, cancers associated with infection are more common in lower-HDI countries because of a higher prevalence of cancer-causing infections, such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). While approximately 15% of all incident cancers worldwide are attributed to infections, the percentage is about three times higher in low-(25%) and medium-(23%) HDI countries than in very Human Development Index The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of development that considers not only standard of living, but also health and education. The health component of HDI is measured by life expectancy at birth. Education includes average years of schooling for adults 25 years of age and older and expected years of schooling for children. Standard of living is measured by gross national income per capita. These scores are used to create a composite measure that can be grouped into levels: low, medium, high, and very high HDI.

Many children with disabilities are out of school The out-of-school rate of children of primary and lower secondary school age is the proportion of children in a given age group who are not attending primary or secondary school. Some of these children may have attended school in the past and dropped out, some may enter school in the future, and some may never go to school.190 Data from six developing countries indicate that, on average, children with disabilities of primary school age (about 6 to 11 years in most countries) are more likely to be out of school than their peers without disabilities (Figure II.27).191 The largest gap between children with and without disabilities was reported for Cambodia, with a 50-percentage point difference between the out-of-school rate of children with and without disabilities (57 per cent versus 7 per cent), which means that children with disabilities are eight times as likely to be out of school as their peers without disabilities. In other countries, the gap is not as wide as in Cambodia but still proves the stark inequality between children with and without disabilities. The out-of-school rates of children with disabilities are two to three times as high as those of children without disabilities in Colombia, the Maldives, Uganda and Yemen. On average, in these countries, children with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be out of school as children without disabilities.

Today in the twenty-first century, migrants may be better able to make contributions to these domains than they were in the last century (or prior) largely because of the phenomenal improvements in development that have taken place in most countries, as well as strong recognition of the need to ensure that global development and stability are underpinned by human rights.112 Yet, this chapter also drives home the point that the contributions of migrants to societies, polities and the economies globally have not only been largely overlooked, downplayed and taken for granted, but also hindered, through proliferation of disruption and disinformation against migrants. Recent research and analysis show that some forms of technology are impacting our media, social and political interactions, and are becoming more pressing for governance, both in relation to the regulation of newer forms of technology and how they are shaping democratic processes.113 The question therefore remains as to what would be a balanced strategy to make the contributions optimally, if not maximally, visible, acknowledged and accepted on the global and national policy agendas.	Recent research and analysis show that some forms of technology are impacting our media, social and political interactions, and are becoming more pressing for governance, both in relation to the regulation of newer forms of technology and how they are shaping democratic processes.

Fourth, global demand for Coted'Ivoire's agricultural export commodities points to continuing opportunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. The extent to which Engel's Law acts as a constraint on the demand for a country's agricultural products (and labor), depends also on the tradability of its agriculture, the evolution of global (as opposed to domestic) demand, and the country's comparative advantage. The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity, the less constrained the country is by domestic demand and the larger is its agriculture's potential for generating jobs. The production and export of cash crops, especially cocoa, but also of coffee, cotton, and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Coted'Ivoire's economy and job creation.

In other cases, indigenous peoples and local communities are co-inhabiting and co-managing areas, and in yet further cases indigenous peoples use the term ""community conserved areas"" for practical reasons, for example when the term ""indigenous"" is not recognised. Similar regional differences exist regarding the term ""territory"". Amongst both indigenous peoples and local communities there are cases where the term ""conserved area"" is used and others where ""protected area"" is preferred: 3. Governance we use a range of terms herein. Below we summarise the concepts and include a description of indigenous peoples' territories and protected areas."

But what will happen if every country in Asia abandons the production of staple grains and reallocates resources to more profitable economic activities and opts for sustaining food security through international trade? In Japan and the Republic of Korea, consumers now pay for domestic rice a price many times higher than that in the world market. But, who will produce the exportable surplus for them? Will rice supply to the world market increase substantially in response to higher prices? What would be the political response in rice-exporting countries to international transactions in staple food when trade generates scarcity in the domestic market? What would be the impact of rising food prices on inflation and other macroeconomic variables? The answers to these questions have important implications for the strategy for sustaining food security through trade for the affluent Asian nations.

By building on the framework of the regional report on Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa ( Filmer et al. 2014 ) , the chapter analyzes patterns of employment across the main employment types : agriculture , nonagricultural self-employment , and wage employment .	Until recently, micro data on the employment situation in Coted'Ivoire have remained relatively scarce. This limited the diagnosis of the employment challenge in the country, as well as analysis of past trends and assessment of future prospects. Recent efforts by the government to provide a more regular flow of employment statistics provide a clearer picture of the employment situation. Nationally representative surveys collected in October 2012, February 2014, and January-March 2015 provide recent and reliable micro data on employment in Coted'Ivoire (see Box 1.1 for a summary of micro data sources). This chapter starts by describing the employment situation in Coted'Ivoire and highlights its broad implications for employment policy. It does not seek to reproduce a large number of employment statistics already available from descriptive survey reports.3 Rather, it focuses on the main patterns that are relevant for policy.

Mobile technology can serve to shape routes , destinations and facilitate the financing of irregular migration .	Migrant agency, the limits of resistance and the way forward The resilience and the agency of migrants are among priority topics explored in IJMBS. As demonstrated in one of the contributions, young temporary migrants from China and Hong Kong, China in the United Kingdom have been able to deploy strategies such as marriage and the use of sexual capital to prolong their stay in this country. In other cases, migrants can manage their own migration trajectories through resourceful use of new technologies. Mobile technology can serve to shape routes, destinations and facilitate the financing of irregular migration. Sadly the IJMBS contributions also show the limits of resistance and the ways in which 338 Appendices migrant agency is harnessed by the state to justify further migration controls and denial of protection. A typical example is the precarious situation of unaccompanied minors who travelled from Mexico and Central America to the United States in 2014. The framing of children as 'illegal migrants' by the United States and Mexican authorities allowed increased deportations. As well, border controls were implemented under the guise of assisting minors, who were cast as agentless victims.

Factors associated with improved supply systems according to the included studies were as follows. * Adequate supervision. Supervisors were noted to have additional duties involving the review of CHW registers and cross-checking of drug inventories in order to make sure supplies are routinely and adequately replenished. This helps reinforce CHW competencies regarding drug use (244). * Correct prescriptions. Having appropriate prescriptions leads to a more accurate and reliable drug resupply for CHWs (244). action for health, and community involvement is therefore seen as a key criterion (241, 242). The resulting paucity of specific evidence limited the conclusions that could be drawn. Therefore, this recommendation is based, to a large extent, on the GDG's view on the potential benefits of CHW involvement in community mobilization efforts. 7.14.5 Implementation considerations Evidence from the two studies indicates that community mobilization activities require a unique skill set that is substantively different from that of providing health promotion and clinical services.

Project UFL16P - 199 - Farm machineries. Prototypes of small-scale machinery for digging, threshing, and sorting peanut have been developed with support from Peanut CRSP. The use of these machineries was demonstrated to farmers during field days. Peanut programs. A National Peanut Program and a Peanut Seed Production Program are in place due to the support of the Peanut CRSP to Bolivia. The government has recognized ANAPO as the national reference institution for peanut research and development. It has developed a private Peanut Seed System that is patterned after its Seed Production System for soybeans, wheat, sunflower, and wheat of ANAPO. Seed, other agrochemical inputs, and technical advice are provided by ANAPO to producers at planting time and paid for during harvest at cost plus a minimal fee. Consumers' survey. A consumers' survey was carried out in 2002, which showed that the processing industry is not developed, with only 2-3 processors in Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. Peanut soup, preferred by 70% of the respondents, is generally produced in the home using traditional recipes. Other products are roasted and salted peanuts.

Other common activities include small-scale manufacturing activities ( such as producing fruit juice , alcohol or other activities involving basic processing and the transformation of agricultural products ) ( 17.4 percent ) , as well as food selling and restaurants ( 15.5 percent ) .	The majority of nonagricultural household enterprises are in small-scale service activities. Figure4.3 indicates that more than 40 percent are in small-scale retail and trading activities, such as selling personal products (Table C.1 in AnnexC lists the most common activities). Other common activities include small-scale manufacturing activities (such as producing fruit juice, alcohol or other activities involving basic processing and the transformation of agricultural products) (17.4 percent), as well as food selling and restaurants (15.5 percent). The majority of nonagricultural household enterprises are operated in urban areas (70.2 percent). In urban areas, retail activities, personal services (hairdressing), and construction activities are relatively more common than in rural areas. In rural areas, activities involving the transformation of agricultural products or selling food are relatively more common (Figure4.3).75 Almost all nonagricultural household enterprises are informal. More than 90 percent are not registered in any way. An earlier informal survey conducted in Abidjan also found similar results (AGEPE 2011). In addition, more than 60 percent of nonagricultural household enterprises report not keeping any books, with just 14.4 percent undertaking formal bookkeeping (Figure4.4). The degree of informality is also evident through the fact that 68.1 percent of household enterprise owners are not subject to formal fiscal regimes. Only some 5.0 percent are subject to regime reel, and 27 percent pay lump-sum taxes (Figure4.5). That being said, most microenterprises do need to pay local authorities for permits (patente) to operate.	Other common activities include small-scale manufacturing activities (such as producing fruit juice, alcohol or other activities involving basic processing and the transformation of agricultural products) (17.4 percent), as well as food selling and restaurants (15.5 percent).

There is also substantial evidence that delivering essential health services through CHWs may represent a cost-effective approach in a diversity of contexts ( 18-20 ) .	Several systematic reviews and other studies demonstrate the effectiveness of various types of CHWs in delivering a range of preventive, promotive and curative services related to reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (4-8), infectious diseases (9), noncommunicable diseases (10, 11), and neglected tropical diseases (12). However, successful delivery of services requires evidence-based models for educating, deploying, remunerating and managing CHWs to optimize their performance and contribution to the health system across various health service areas. Other systematic reviews have identified the most effective policy approaches for successful integration of health workers into health systems and the communities they serve. These include providing CHWs with predictable financial and non-financial incentives, frequent supportive supervision, continuous training, and embedding CHWs in health systems and in the communities where they work, with clear roles and communication channels for CHWs (13-17). There is also substantial evidence that delivering essential health services through CHWs may represent a cost-effective approach in a diversity of contexts (18-20). Empowering CHWs also offers a critical opening for change towards achieving greater gender equity within communities. 19 Rationale The support for CHWs and their integration into the health system and in the communities they serve are uneven across and within countries; good-practice examples are not necessarily replicated and policy options for which there is greater evidence of effectiveness are not uniformly adopted.	There is also substantial evidence that delivering essential health services through CHWs may represent a cost-effective approach in a diversity of contexts (18-20).

Violence against Women 161 box 6.5 When data on violence against women informs policy: The case of Kiribati A dedicated study on violence against women and childrena was conducted in Kiribati in 2008, the first such study in that country. It revealed that Kiribati has one of the highest recorded levels of violence against women in the world: 68 per cent of ever-partnered women said they were victims of physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner, 47 per cent reported incidents of emotional abuse, and 90 per cent reported experiencing at least one form of controlling behaviour. Women were more likely to be subjected to severe forms of partner physical violence such as punching, kicking or having a weapon used against them, than moderate forms of physical violence. Twenty-three per cent of women who had ever been pregnant reported being beaten during pregnancy, and women who had experienced intimate partner violence were significantly more likely to report miscarriage and a child who died.

Children embark on a broad range of different types of migration. Some migration journeys are highly gendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the sex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity. Many other migrations, the majority, include both boys and girls, though sometimes in different ratios, depending on country of origin. Much child migration, particularly outside the context of conflict or disaster, is safe and undertaken as part of a family unit. However, there is an increasing tendency for children to be involved in migration that jeopardizes their safety and violates their rights. Examples of this type of migration include not only the obviously life-threatening forced migrations across treacherous routes - such as the Eastern and Central Mediterranean, where drownings are frequent - but also migrations where children are routinely exposed to physical and/or sexual violence. Unsafe migration also includes situations where children rely on exploitative intermediaries who take advantage of the need for migration assistance to extract labour or other types of services from children in their custody.

Leadership : This dimension concerns leadership in the community , here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public .	The early literature on empowerment typically used one global measure for empowerment. For example, parents' education was often used to measure agency or decision-making within the household (Alkire 2007); husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981). However, it is possible that agency differs across different spheres of life and can exist simultaneously in different ways. For example, a person can be fully employed as a wife and mother, excluded from the labor force by social conventions, and recently empowered to vote by political processes. Because such distinctions have policy relevance, it is important to identify and compare agency achievements in different domains rather than in one alone (Alkire 2007, 166). Because agency and empowerment are experienced with different tasks and can be described and measured with different domains, Alkire (2005) suggests that most measures of agency and empowerment should be domain specific. For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1. Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment. 2. Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit. 3. Income: This dimension concerns sole or joint control over the use of income and expenditures. 4. Leadership: This dimension concerns leadership in the community, here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public. 5. Time: This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities.

Winners and losers Information for a resource scarce world Population is an important factor The big picture High quality of life with fewer resources Ecological traps The poor become poorer Part 2 Ecological accounting Does the second point concern urban structure? Yes, in fact. The way a city is built, how it functions, how spread out or compact it is, how efficient or resource-sparing the energy provision is, all determines the resource efficiency for a city. Urban structure determines at least 80 percent of its residents' Footprint. The Footprint is dependent on where food comes from, how mobile people are, what people buy. Take Houston as an example, a very spread out city in Texas. Its houses are not energy efficient compared to European standards and are poorly insulated. In addition, the houses are widely scattered requiring car trips for even simple errands like getting milk or a newspaper. The residents of Houston use about 12 global hectares of ecologically productive area per person. If someone from Houston moved to Siena, Italy, they would require one-third or quarter of this Footprint to support the same quality of life, because one can reach many places by foot in Siena. Besides, the houses are smaller and more compact. The food is more local and seasonally oriented. In general, Siena offers a charming and attractive life for which one only needs a quarter or a third of the resources. The interesting thing is this: people in Siena don't need to be instructed in having a lower Footprint. It happens because the city structure invites them to live a particular lifestyle. If we enhance Siena with the technological possibilities that we currently have on this planet, even larger Footprint savings would result. For instance, in Italy, a large portion of energy is still produced by coal burning power plants. If this energy were to be produced renewably, or with cleaner technology, Siena's Footprint would shrink without people in Siena having to change anything about their lifestyles.

"Climate hazards affect agriculture through both short-and longterm adverse impacts on economic growth and human well-being (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Barrett and Santos 2014, Hsiang and Jina 2014). These impacts are heterogeneous; some groups, e.g. households, communities, or countries, face higher probabilities of exposure, some are better able to resist shocks, and some are better able to recover. At the same time, hazard impacts on agriculture can reinforce poverty traps, and heighten risk. In the absence of markets for insurance and credit, these impacts can lead farmers to choose low-return agricultural technologies to maintain stable livelihoods, often at levels below the poverty line (Carter et al. 2007, Dercon and Christiaensen 2011, Barrett et al. 2015). Repeated exposure to climate hazards can undermine current and future coping capacity (Bene et al. 2016a, Duncan et al. 2017). In this context of growing awareness of the damaging interaction between climate hazards, response and coping capacity, and short-and long-term growth, the policy of ""resilience building"" has emerged as a possible antidote.

The concept of effectuation represents a quite practical and hands-on approach to teaching ""through"" entrepreneurship. It has been developed by Saras Sarasvathy and colleagues (see for example Sarasvathy, 2001, Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005, Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011). Effectuation is described as an iterative process of decision making and active commitment seeking that results in creation of new value, where each iteration is started with questions such as ""Who am I?"", ""what do i know?"" and ""Whom do I know?"". Sarasvathy and Venkataraman (2011) propose that entrepreneurship could be regarded as a generic method for creating potentially valuable change by unleashing human potential, and has contrasted this to the scientific method designed to harness mother nature. Viewing entrepreneurship as a generic method holds much promise for the field of entrepreneurial education, but requires emphasis on taking action, value creation and using creativity tools (Neck and Greene, 2011). 64. Effectuation constitutes a useful toolbox for teachers in any domain and on any educational level. A student team can be asked to identify a simple problem in real life they would like to address.

By interacting iteratively with the outside world they can learn more about the problem, the people affected by it and how they can help. They need not be anywhere near a solution when initiating the process, they only need to focus on the next step that needs to be taken to approach the problem and learn more about it. A book by Read et al. (2011) targeted to teachers and practitioners provides ample practical advice when using the effectual approach. This book and its concepts is somewhat venture creation focused, but many of the principles can be applied to value creation processes in all stages of education."

Marracuene district is situated approximately 30 km from Maputo city. The district was affected by flooding with hundreds of families displaced from low-lying farm lands. Marracuene lies on the main north -south highway. Displaced populations from the city of Maputo were resettled in Marracuene. There is a certain level of population pressure on land in Marracuene. The district has a high level of female-headed households with a strong tradition of migratory male labor to South Africa9 and the city of Maputo. The livelihoods of the residents of Marracuene are varied, with petty trading being an important aspect of economic survival for the poorest households.

For pregnant and breastfeeding women , the occupational health practitioner 's medical supervision is reinforced .	Recommendation No.191, Paragraph 6(2) Recommendation No. 191 suggests that protective measures should be taken when work involves risks and an alternative to the work should be provided. These measures are strictly related to maternity and therefore are not to be considered discriminatory under Convention No. 111 (Article 5.1). Many of thecountries analysed provide for measures designed to protect pregnant or nursing women from workplace risks. Such measures typically include a modification of the tasks involved to make them safer and more suitable for the woman's needs, a temporary transfer to a safer position or, in the absence of other possibilities, placing a worker on temporary leave. Of the 160countries with information, 84 provide some sort of alternative while 76 provide no alternative. Iceland, for example, calls for the adaptation of working conditions. If the safety and health of a pregnant woman, a woman who has recently given birth or a woman who is breastfeeding is considered to be at risk, according to a special assessment, her employer must make the necessary arrangements to ensure the woman's safety by temporarily changing her conditions and/or working hours or, if adaptation is not possible, transferring her to another post or placing her on temporary paid leave. In France, employers must assess any risks in the workplace that might influence workers' safety or health and define measures to be taken. For pregnant and breastfeeding women, the occupational health practitioner's medical supervision is reinforced. If a pregnant or new mother is exposed to risk, her employer may adapt the post or transfer her temporarily to a safer position without any loss in wages, or the employer may provide paid leave.

Step 2: Identify Potential Markets First, you should identify 5 to 10 large and fast-growing markets for your company's product. Look at trends over the past 3 to 5 years. Has market growth been consistent year to year? Did import growth occur even during periods of economic recession? If not, did growth resume with economic recovery? Then, take a look at some smaller, fast-emerging markets that may provide groundfloor opportunities. If the market is just beginning to open up, there may be fewer competitors than in established markets. To qualify as up-and-coming markets, these countries should have substantially higher growth rates. Burma (which recently opened its economy after years of economic sanctions) and Morocco (which entered into a free trade agreement with the United States in 2005) are good examples of such markets.

Developing economies require access to English There are a number of clear unifying factors between the countries selected for this research despite their diverse geographical location. All are developing nations, attempting to set in place growth strategies and reposition themselves in the new global economy. An important element of these growth strategies is recognition of the importance of English, in order to communicate in the international business world. A focus on improved language skills has helped to attract more foreign investment, further increasing the need for English speakers in these countries. This underpins the growth of national and individual wealth, and helps drive economic development. Workers with solid English language skills are therefore in the best position to take the fullest advantage of new opportunities in these rapidly developing economies. Demand for English language education is driven by a number of factors. These include inward investment (with international companies typically using English for internal communication), ambitious individuals looking to sharpen their competitive edge in the labour market, as well as government efforts to encourage business investment by allocating greater budgets to the teaching of English.

Many JMHS papers receive extensive media coverage and attention by policymakers. This has included a set of papers - authored by Robert Warren and occasionally co-authored by Donald Kerwin - based on CMS estimates of the US undocumented and other populations, derived from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey. This series has documented the falling US undocumented population, their characteristics, and the fact that most newly undocumented residents enter the United States legally and overstay their visas, rather than illegally cross a border. The latter point - elaborated in several JMHS papers - has been referenced in more than a hundred discrete media outlets since 2017 and has become a staple of the public debate on the Trump administration's proposed US-Mexico border wall. 22 Articles cited in the journal editor's contribution can be found at: https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mhs. 329WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 JMHS has also published exhaustive profiles on other populations targeted by the Trump administration, including potential DREAM Act beneficiaries (undocumented persons brought to the United States as children), refugees, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, persons with a close family relationship to a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) that would potentially qualify them for a visa, and long-term residents who may be eligible to naturalize. These papers - which illustrate the deep and longstanding ties of these groups to the United States - have garnered substantial attention from national and local government officials, policymakers, academics, researchers, the business community, NGOs, and the press. Although extremist groups and politicians occasionally dispute (without evidence) CMS's estimates, the JMHS papers in this series offer a factual basis and rare common ground in the US immigration debate.

The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former .	"The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history. Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

The unit cost of production is 10 times higher in Japan and seven times higher in the Republic of Korea than in Thailand and Vietnam , the major rice exporters in the world market ( Table 4 ) .	The increasing cost of rice production in middle-and high-income countries is preventing them from exporting surplus rice that has resulted from declining domestic consumption. Instead, it has lowered production. In Japan, the rice harvest reached 18.8 million t in 1967, after which it gradually fell to 10 million t in 1999. In Taiwan (China), the harvest reached 3.6 million t in 1976, whereas current production is below 2.0 million t. Meanwhile, growing scarcity of land, labor, and water continues to drive up the cost of rice production in spite of more efficient use of inputs (through improved crop management practices) and saving of labor (through mechanization). The unit cost of production is 10 times higher in Japan and seven times higher in the Republic of Korea than in Thailand and Vietnam, the major rice exporters in the world market (Table 4). The Japanese government has encouraged farmers to divert rice land to other crops, but not all rice land is suitable for other crops. 66 Rice almanac Under political pressure from farm lobbies, the government had to protect the domestic rice market by increasing prices and providing farm subsidies, to keep a balance between incomes of rice farmers and incomes of urban labor households. Rice production had been adjusted to domestic demand through manipulation of trade, pricing, and subsidy policies.

Furthermore, it has permeated many institutions that have a role to play in the fight against corruption, including the police and judiciary. On a more positive note, the issues of corruption are now discussed more openly in the country than in previous decades, with the media raising cases of corruption almost on a daily basis.

The region of Central America and the Caribbean continues to be used as a major trans-shipment area for consignments of drugs originating in South America and destined for North America and Europe. In the Caribbean, countries have begun playing an increasing role as secondary distribution points for cocaine shipments to Europe.26 Impunity, corruption and weak institutions undermine drug control efforts and the rule of law in the region, despite attempts to reform law enforcement and judicial systems. Drug trafficking activities are often carried out under the protection of local gangs (maras) operating in border areas, especially in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. 355.

In the context of Coted'Ivoire , two factors stand out as possible constraints to output demand growth : transport infrastructure and logistics , and firm capabilities .	In the context of Coted'Ivoire, two factors stand out as possible constraints to output demand growth: transport infrastructure and logistics, and firm capabilities. As in most countries, rapid expansion of demand is most likely to occur in tradable sectors. Coted'Ivoire has an advantage over many other landlocked countries but its logistic performance index (LPI) is barely above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. The cost of export and import based on Doing Business data is inexplicably more expensive than landlocked countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali.105 For smaller firms in particular, reaching the regional market might be an important 104 Doing Business data on Minimum wage/Ratio of minimum wage to value added per employee: Kenya: 269.4/1.4, CI: 119.0/0.5, Senegal: 185.6/1.1, Cameroon: 70.3/0.3, Burkina Faso: 107.9/1, Sri Lanka: 79.3/0.2, Ghana: 60.1/0.3, Mali:62/0.5, Vietnam: 142.5/0.6 105 See http://www.doingbusiness.org/Custom-Query/cote-divoire channel for export. Yet road and rail transport infrastructure in Coted'Ivoire is inefficient and expensive, contributed to by entrenched monopoly, inefficient quota system, and pervasive roadblocks and corruption demands in the north such as along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor (WorldBank 2014, 2015b). Successful demand accumulation also requires a certain degree of firm capabilities. As argued earlier, the fact that Ivorian firms are significantly less able to survive in sectors with a high rate of foreign entry suggests the need to improve capabilities for domestic firms. These include, beyond better access to finance, other complementary inputs such as business services support, access to information about foreign markets, and public inputs such as quality standards. The next section discusses some of the policy tools toward this goal.

"66 Ayeb-Karlsson et Al., 2016. 67 IOM, 2017. 68 ibid. 263WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 Relocation of some coastal and island communities has begun. One study projects that over 400 towns, villages and cities in the United States, including a large number of coastal indigenous communities, will need to relocate by the end of the century as a result of environmental change.69 Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana will be the first community to receive federal funds and support for relocation. Residents have worked with local non-governmental organizations to plan a new sustainable community and settlement using modern technology and innovative use of wetlands and parklands to protect against flooding while maintaining fishing livelihoods. A significant challenge will be to incorporate the history, traditions and culture of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe.70 The full involvement of affected communities in decisionmaking on matters including access to resources, where the new settlement will be sited and when and how the project develops plays an important role in community relocation.71 Migration with dignity Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) leaders have coined the term ""migration with dignity"" to envisage a situation in which people have control over whether, when, where and how they can move, or stay if that is their wish. The idea centres on boosting education standards so that migrants can compete in the international labour markets and on strengthening networks with the diaspora in the region to create new opportunities and support new arrivals.a It is hoped that such flows of people could reduce the strain on households and environmental resources, and provide financial and social remittances to enable other forms of adaptation."

In tertiary education globally , enrolments are increasing faster for women than for men .	Key findings * Despite progress, only one in two children in developing regions receive pre-primary education compared to nine in 10 in developed regions. * Primary school enrolment at the appropriate age is nearly universal in most regions, except sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. * Yet, an estimated 58 million children of primary school age--31 million of whom are girls--are out of school. * Only 72 per cent of the world's girls and 74 per cent of boys attend secondary school; gender disparities at the secondary level are wider than those at the primary level. In tertiary education globally, enrolments are increasing faster for women than for men. * The proportion of women graduating in the fields of science and engineering remains low in poor and rich countries alike. * Women account for 30 per cent of all researchers. * Women account for about two thirds of teachers at the primary level, 52 per cent at the secondary level and 42 per cent at the tertiary level. * Nearly two thirds of the world's 781 million illiterate adults are women, and almost all of them live in developing regions. * The vast majority of the world's youth are literate: 87 per cent of young women and 92 per cent of young men having basic reading and writing skills.

Because yieldenhancing technologies are fertilizer intensive A targeted investment climate ?	An example is targeting in the agricultural sector. The underlying logic is based on the notion of public goods. The biggest obstacles to agricultural development are the lack of appropriate technologies and adequate infrastructures. As arable land becomes scarce, the development of yield-enhancing technologies is indispensable.120 But incentives to generate these technologies are undermined because they can be replicated freely.121 Thus, public policy plays a role by supporting the development and dissemination of such technologies.

More efficient logistics and public investments in major infrastructure facilities usually complement the package of incentives. A recent version of spatial targeting is the idea of charter cities: to attract businesses to a country with low credibility in the eyes of foreign investors, sovereignty of a city could be handed over to another country in exchange for the enforcement of a credible set of rules.123 The objective is to strengthen the investment climate in a small part of the country, potentially providing a demonstration effect for further reforms, while not threatening the rents of powerful local elites elsewhere.

When a child's education is delayed or disrupted, the ripple effects may be seen in out-ofschool rates for a decade or more to come. As a consequence, bringing down out-of-school rates requires not only getting more children into school and reducing dropout, but also dealing with entrenched problems of over-age enrollment.19 Supporting countries in implementing strategies to get more children into school, and completing their education, is one of GPE's core priorities. For example, the South Sudan General Education Strategic Plan (2017-2021) prioritizes providing education to out-of-school children. In December 2018, the GPE Board approved a grant to support a program in South Sudan that would bring more than 330,000 out-of-school children into the education system. In Eritrea, the GPE-supported program targeted areas where most of the out-of-school children live. In 2018, the program provided 3,428,668 textbooks and teacher's guides, trained 1,550 teachers from minority groups for deployment to underserved areas, and trained another 478 teachers in mother-tongue instruction to expand access to education for these children.

Rice is the single most important crop , grown on 6.0 million ha or about two-thirds of the country 's total cultivated area .	Rice around the world 111 Recent developments in the rice sector Myanmar has a predominantly agricultural economy based on rice production. The agricultural sector, including livestock and fisheries, accounts for 53% of the country's GDP. Rice is the single most important crop, grown on 6.0 million ha or about two-thirds of the country's total cultivated area. Rice production employs 40% of the total labor force and consumes 70% of total commercial fertilizers. Rice maintains its position as the main staple food crop, accounting for 97% of total food grain production. The importance of rice as a major foreign exchange earner, however, has declined over time. Before World War II, Myanmar was the largest riceexporting country in the world. However, because of stagnation of production since the early 1960s, Thailand took the place of Myanmar in the export market, as exports declined from 1.7 million t in 1962 to 0.3 million t in 1975. Annual exports had fluctuated from 0.5 to 0.9 million t during 1976- 86, a period of respectable growth in rice production. Exports in recent years have fallen below 100,000 t. Myanmar has the capacity to substantially increase rice exports, but it is constrained by poor grain quality, inadequate processing and marketing infrastructure, and an underdeveloped trading system.

Similar findings have been obtained in several other West African nations, demonstrating that rice availability and rice prices have become a major determinant of the welfare of the poorest segments of West African consumers who are the least food-secure.	These trends have meant that rice is no longer a luxury food, but has become a major source of calories for the urban poor.

Rice is the staple cereal crop in many deltas and is a major constituent of livelihoods .	Climate hazards affect subsistence farmers in deltas through frequent floods, droughts, and storm surges with subsequent impacts on food production. Rice is the staple cereal crop in many deltas and is a major constituent of livelihoods. Rice cropping is sensitive to losses following climate hazards (Krishna Kumar et al. 2004, Birthal et al. 2015). Data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the Mahanadi Delta, Odisha (a coastal state in Northeast India; Fig. 1), shows that commonly cultivated rice varieties suffer a 45% yield loss relative to flood-tolerant varieties when farms are exposed to submergence for 10 days (Dar et al. 2013). Similarly, in Bangladesh, climate hazards are a significant cause of income volatility for rice farmers (Mottaleb et al. 2013). There is also evidence that climate hazards have long-term consequences; tropical cyclone shocks to rice farmers in Bangladesh reduced spending on education (Mottaleb et al. 2013) and the 1999 super cyclone in Odisha left coastal fields too saline for rice cropping with livelihoods not recovering a decade later (Chhotray and Few 2012).

Currently each person on Earth demands an average of a 2.7 gha Footprint, as compared to the biocapacity of 2.1 gha which are available per person. If all humans were to live like Europeans, we would need more than two Earths; at US-American consumption levels we would need almost five. The problem: we have only this, single planet. Somehow we must learn to live within our budget. Footprint calculations estimate that humanity moved into ecological overshoot in the 1980's or earlier.

The choice depends on the country's natural endowments and societal goals.126 In nonagricultural sectors, the main obstacles to job creation can be identified through quantitative and qualitative assessments of the constraints faced by enterprises. While these assessments need to be interpreted with caution, differences in responses across enterprises reveal patterns that can also be used for developing targeted policy interventions (box 6.10).127 If creating competitive cities is a feature of a country's jobs agenda, enterprise surveys can provide information on how different the constraints faced by businesses are in cities of different sizes (figure 6.10a). If the jobs agenda Surveys of entrepreneurs and senior managers can provide feedback on what the private sector sees as significant constraints to private sector development. Some care in interpreting their responses is necessary, however. The respondents will give answers that reflect constraints on their bottom line--without regard to the broader societal or welfare implications. Almost every entrepreneur will complain that taxes and interest rates on loans are too high. But that does not necessarily mean that taxes should be lowered or that interest rates are out of line with risks faced by creditors. Constraints to the individual respondents need to be weighed against the broader social goals.	Among staple crops, rice, wheat, and maize are more promising than sorghum and millet, but the latter crops are grown in drier and harsher conditions where farmers are particularly poor.124 Modern cereal varieties are high yielding primarily in favorable rain-fed and irrigated areas.125 Thus, agricultural policies are bound to affect the well-being of the rural population differently in different regions.

As countries urbanize , congestion , pollution , and other costs of high density become increasingly serious , so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case .	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).

Third , prioritize personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and medical production .	To the local governments, China's central government set a few principles on balancing the reopening of businesses and supporting SMEs with epidemic control: First, COVID-19 prevention readiness is a criterion in reopening: Local governments will review business reopening applications, with a focus on assessing whether the business has met the COVID-19 prevention requirements, monitoring the business on its implementation of the disease prevention methods, and helping the business make a plan for emergencies. Second, business reopening is happening in waves. Instead of letting all businesses open at one time, priority is given to the businesses high on the local government's list--for example, Shanghai prioritized businesses that have an impact on city development and daily needs and businesses with large contributions to the area economy. Zhejiang Province gave first priority to its major export industries. Third, prioritize personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical production.30 The responsibility for implementation of these principles falls on local governments. Some governments have focused more on outbreak control, such as where there is a need for morestringent rules on social distancing, travel case tracing, and quarantine (e.g., Beijing), while others have focused more on jump-starting the economy, such as by supporting factories with chartered buses, trains, and planes to transport some of the 290 million migrant workers (e.g., Shanghai).

European integration, the economy successfully restructured its export sector to access EU markets. Very good infrastructure and a fairly skilled workforce helped as well. This dynamism, requiring the use of more advanced production and management techniques in modern sectors, was especially well-suited for youth. While the story is a good one in many ways, further policy reforms could help Slovenia realize more of the development payoffs that flow from jobs for young people. Some of these reforms are in the labor market, such as removing the incentives created by employment protection laws that tilt job creation for youth toward contract and temporary work. But others are outside the labor market, such as introducing measures to encourage more FDI.81 Connected jobs agendas: Global partnerships for jobs Policies for jobs in one country can have spillovers on other countries, both positive and negative. An important issue is whether international coordination mechanisms could influence the decisions that governments make, enhancing the positive spillovers and mitigating the negative ones. Several areas lend themselves to coordination. Promoting compliance with rights and labor standards, a global public good, is the most obvious one, but the effectiveness of the mechanisms for doing so is limited. Measures to facilitate FDI flows, especially in services, would have substantial effects on productivity in developing countries but they may also have social implications. Migration has impacts on both sending and recipient countries, suggesting that bilateral agreements could lead to better outcomes for both parties.

As lack of comprehensive data is a major obstacle to the analysis in this field, a specific effort is devoted to improving the factual base on market trends and diffusion of non-debt financing instruments, to complement the information on SME access to finance from the Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs: An OECD Scoreboard, which largely focuses on debt instruments. 46. The second part consists of case studies on selected financing instruments (crowdfunding, securitisation, covered bonds, corporate bonds and private placements), developed in cooperation with the Committee on Financial Markets. The cases examine the characteristics, diffusion and uptake by new firms and SMEs of selected instruments, assess their effectiveness in supporting innovative or potentially highgrowth firms to overcome financing constraints, evaluate what contextual factors can improve or hamper SMEs' access to these instruments, illustrate policy experiences and programmes outcomes, and identify good practices to promote broader use of alternative financing techniques. The case studies are based on secondary sources, including literature review and public reports, and on interviews with policy makers, SME representatives, practitioners in relevant public and private institutions, other market participants and independent experts.

Adolescence is a time of general good health, with low mortality rates. Nevertheless, many lifestyle choices made during this period have negative consequences later in life. It is estimated that at least 70 per cent of premature adult deaths result from behaviour that started or was reinforced during adolescence, such as unhealthy eating, alcohol and tobacco use, substance abuse, unsafe sex and lack of physical activity.74 Adolescence is also the age when young women and men increasingly model their behaviour on adult gender roles. In some societies, adolescent girls are pressured into early marriage and childbearing and their access to information on health and their power to make their own decisions remain low. Adolescent boys often take up harmful habits and risky behaviours that are associated with images of masculinity.

Better Work is modeled on the Better Factories Cambodia program, which was introduced in conjunction with the bilateral trade agreement between Cambodia and the United States. Results of evaluations of Better Factories Cambodia, covering more than 90 percent of participating factories, found that compliance on occupational safety and health improved 20 percent. Correct payment of wages, overtime, and benefits increased 37 percent. Initially, incentives to improve working conditions were driven by the quota increases called for under the trade agreement; however, with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), quota increases were no longer possible. Nevertheless, the Cambodian garment industry has continued to invest in monitoring, having identified labor compliance as an important part of its claim to a niche in the global garment industry.

Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India , to paprika in Hungary , and to spicy kimchee in Korea .	"The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history. Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

In order to convey reliable information and fight fake news one must use the same communication channels and mechanisms. WhatsApp is a powerful tool for this kind of campaigns for several reasons: messages come directly to the user's phone, from known contacts, and therefore seem more credible, the immediacy of message delivery can create a feeling of urgency about particular topics and it can be used to penetrate communities that do not have access to other platforms. Various measures have been taken in the past to curb the viral spread of fake news - with limited success. Fighting misinformation is important. But instead of just reacting, NGOs and government organizations should be enabled to create viral SBCC campaigns for mobile communication channels by themselves.

"The experience of exile and life after it is also examined in the dossier ""Living, thinking, writing in exile"" (33/1, 2017) coordinated by the historian Ralph Schor, who strives to understand the paths and identity choices of a particular category of exiles: writers and thinkers. Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of oneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer's perspective. Some varia articles 340 Appendices focus on the links between film and migration experiences in countries with a film industry. In what way do cinema and photography open up new discursive spaces? A special richly illustrated dossier is devoted to the links between photography, migration and cities (32/3-4, 2016). How cinema and photography reflect migrants' migratory experiences, imaginations, living, housing and working conditions?

Selected Country/Economy Analysis The United States is the top scorer in the Americas, moving up one place to rank fifth globally. The combination of the overall size of its economy and T&T competitiveness helps explain why the country has the largest T&T GDP in the world, accounting for over one-fifth of the global total. In comparison to the global average, one of the United States' greatest advantages comes from its natural (5th) and cultural (12th) resources, which also helps separate it from many other developed nations in the rankings. The country is well known for its numerous World Heritage natural sites (3rd) and extensive wildlife (13th), which drive nature-based tourist arrivals (35th). The flow of travellers is assisted by excellent air transport (3rd) and tourist services (4th) infrastructure and increasingly efficient ground transport (17th to 6th). However, the primary reason for the United States' improvement is its better enabling environment (25th to 16th), including enhancements to already-strong business environment (16th to 4th) and human resource and labour market (13th to 1st) areas. Combined with solid ICT readiness (18th), these factors help encourage T&T investment, utilization of digital services and business travel.

On-farm and off-farm activities can be complementary in assisting households to manage risk. In other contexts off-farm income has been important in helping small-scale farmers cope with shocks in India (Gaurav 2015), Mozambique (Cunguara et al. 2011), and South America (Bebbington 1999). In Odisha, vulnerable farming communities are characterized by dependence Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ on subsistence rice farming and limited off-farm opportunities (Panda 2016). In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined. This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.

It has been described as an approach somewhere in between internships, practica and volunteerism (Kenworthy-U'Ren et al., 2006). The approach has been applied in many educational disciplines, such as nursing, literacy learning, computer science, engineering, teacher education and business (Desplaces et al., 2009).

Still, very little research has been done on the interaction between them (For some exceptions, see Desplaces et al., 2009, McCrea, 2009, Litzky et al., 2009). Teachers interested in working with entrepreneurial education could probably learn much from service-learning initiatives, such as components of successful service-learning programs (Kenworthy-U'Ren et al., 2006) and factors that motivate and deter use of a service-learning approach in educational institutions (Abes et al., 2002).

Donor main areas of interventions of relevance to AC in Bangladesh have been four-fold: * helping the government set up institutions that deal directly with corruption (most notably the ACC) * supporting essential governance reforms, from PFM to support in the justice sector * mainstreaming the fight against corruption in their support to social sectors; * ensuring that their own money is not misused. 3.18. Annex 5, which maps the donor programmes against UNCAC, identifies 20 donor projects (irrespective of their sizes) as being of direct or potential relevance to tackling corruption in Bangladesh. 3.19. The composition of projects reveals significant differences in the level and scope of donor interventions. The largest single programme is the ADB-supported GGP (2007-12) which uses a development policy loan as the aid modality. The value is US$150 million plus an additional US$2.8 million for TA. The GGP, which was preceded and supported by a number of smaller TA, supports activities in three UNCAC categories dealing with preventive policies and practices (Articles 5 and 6), civil service reform (Article 7) and legal sector reform (Article 11 and Criminalisation). DFID's total portfolio over the evaluation period is the largest, totalling about US$200 million. The selected projects cover six UNCAC categories. Denmark's portfolio amounts to about US$45 million across five of the six themes, Norway's is US$35 million and Sweden US$3 million. 22 For example, the idea of a National Committee on Corruption Prevention was not pursued. Instead the concept of an NIS was developed, as Bangladesh ratified UNCAC.	The selected projects cover six UNCAC categories.

Rethinking international migration, internal migration, mobility and urbanization That migration is the most problematic of the population variables is taken as given. Unlike the unique events of birth and death that define an individual's lifetime, migration can be a multiple event. Its measurement depends entirely upon how it is defined in time and across space. ... Despite all the problems inherent in the collection of migration data, significant progress has been achieved over recent years. The compilation of a world origin-destination database, developed originally at the University of Sussex and now much extended and maintained by the United Nations Population Division and the World Bank, has provided the framework for a more precise measurement of global international population movement.a These data showed that about 3 per cent of the world's population lived in a State or territory not of their birth and that that proportion had not changed significantly since the 1990s ... As the systems of internal and international migration evolve and change, so too, does the nature of the linkages between them ... other forms of short-term mobility emerge from essentially urban cultures and economies. ... The idea that most people do not move or are fixed at a specific location might be appealing but it is wrong. Mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility. Nevertheless, some peoples appear to move more than others and in different ways from others, which appears to be closely linked with the level of development in each country, which, in turn, is linked with the distribution of the population in each country. Despite all the difficulties with the measurement of internal migration as sketched above, considerable progress has been made towards the construction of analytical models that allow the comparison of patterns across space.

Human rights groups reported unlawful killings and other serious human rights violations by security forces, primarily in the context of excessive use of force during mass protests or during security operations. No perpetrators were known to have been held to account, particularly for numerous incidents in Papua. EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE Between September 2016 and January 2017, joint police and military forces carried out security operations in Dogiyai, Papua province, during the run-up to the 2017 local elections. On 10 January police officers arbitrarily arrested Otis Pekei when he refused to hand over a knife at a police checkpoint, and detained him at the Moanemani sub-district police station. Later that day, police delivered Otis Pekei's body to the home of his family; the family accused the police of torturing him during detention. No investigation was known to have been conducted. On 1 August in Deiyai, Papua province, police officers arbitrarily opened fire into a crowd of protesters without warning, wounding at least 10 people, including children. Nine police officers were subjected to disciplinary action; no criminal proceedings were known to have been opened. UNLAWFUL KILLINGS The number of killings by police of suspected drug dealers increased sharply, from 18 in 2016 to at least 98 in 2017. Some of the officers involved in the incidents were seconded to the National Narcotics Agency. Police claimed that all the killings were in self-defence or because suspects tried to flee the scene. No independent investigations were known to have been conducted into these killings. The number of deaths escalated after several high-ranking Indonesian officials, including the President, 196 Amnesty International Report 2017/18 advocated during the year for tougher measures to address drug-related crime, including calling for the application of unrestrained lethal force against suspected traffickers.

Issues for consideration * There are few areas of the terrestrial and marine worlds which do not bear the hallmarks of earlier human action, though in many cases the original human inhabitants are no longer present. In many cases, category Ia areas will therefore require a process of restoration. This restoration should be through natural processes or time-limited interventions: if continual intervention is required the area would be more suitable in some other category, such as IV or V. * There are few areas not under some kind of legal or at least traditional ownership, so that finding places that exclude human activity is often problematic. * Some human actions have a regional and global reach that is not restricted by protected area boundaries. This is most apparent with climate and air pollution, and new and emerging diseases.

Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

It is vital because exporters wish to be paid when goods are shipped while importers do not want to pay before they receive the merchandise. This can be a major problem in view of the fact that cargos from Europe to Asia may take up to 80 days. Financial institutions can help to bridge the gap between importers and exporters by providing payment solutions while taking the credit risk. Very little international trade is actually paid as cash in advance. The trade finance market is therefore sizable as the vast majority of the US$ 23 trillion worth of goods require a loan, payment guarantee or credit insurance to cross borders.

Workers are hired and dismissed , or they quit their jobs and start their own businesses ; meanwhile some firms close and others are born .	"Turnover versus decoupling Every day, jobs are created and destroyed. Workers are hired and dismissed, or they quit their jobs and start their own businesses; meanwhile some firms close and others are born. In industrial countries, this process of creative destruction affects around 15 percent of all jobs every year.86 In normal times, the probability of job loss for an individual is largely independent of the probability of job loss for another. And the probability of landing another job is also independent of what happens to other workers. The employment shock is then what economists call ""idiosyncratic."" But there are exceptional times, when employment shocks are systemic. Then, a sustained decoupling of the normal process of job creation and job destruction occurs: jobs are lost in large numbers but not created at the same pace. This is what occurs in times of severe economic crises, when a decline in economic activity affects a broad swath of firms and industries. Job destruction accelerates, often sharply, and job creation levels offor even decreases (figure 8.7). This decoupling leads to unemployment in formalized economies and under-employment in less formalized ones.87 In many countries, droughts, floods, or other natural disasters can have a similar impact. After the sources of the crisis dissipate, job creation picks up and unemployment or underemployment declines. The longer it takes for job creation to recover, the longer unemployment or under employment lasts."

Agricultural interventions need to take into account these contextual factors to shift rice cropping onto a trajectory toward resilience .	Investigations have been made into the use of resilience as a concept to guide development. These studies have focused on the following: identifying which economic units are or are not resilient; the differential impacts of shocks on these units; and the responses of different economic units to these shocks (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Akter and Mallick 2013, Constas et al. 2014, Alfani et al. 2015, Jain et al. 2015, Cisse and Barrett 2016). Analysis of this nature enables interventions to be targeted to increase the resistance of farmers to hazards, e.g., flood resistant seeds (Dar et al. 2013) or enable ex post coping (e.g., Akter et al. 2016). Our work builds upon the arguments of Bene et al. (2016a) and Enfors (2013) in highlighting the importance of contextual factors to explain resilience in farmers. Our analysis strongly suggests that a range of interacting contextual factors prevent the emergence of resilient, high-return rice cropping livelihoods. Agricultural interventions need to take into account these contextual factors to shift rice cropping onto a trajectory toward resilience. Our context-based analysis shows how rice cultivation and the prevailing social norms, formal institutions, and economy interact to shape coping capacity and the distribution of resilience. We argue that context based studies that explain how resilience occurs and resilience measurement studies that monitor economic units pre-and postshock are complementary. Contextbased studies can explain why differential levels of postdisaster resilience occur. Such complementary analysis will likely lead to more sustainable and effective resilience building interventions.

Significant effort over the next 5-10 years will be required to achieve success in this demanding field .	Scientifically this is an area that is attractive and could, if brought to fruition, offer practical assistance to minimizing pre-harvest aflatoxin levels in peanuts. There is no doubting the scientific competence of the Principal Investigator and his ability to make a success of this demanding area. However, the change in the Principal Investigator, change of direction scientifically, and poor interactions with host countries have all hampered progress in this project. The funding from Peanut CRSP has been limited and there is not much evidence that there has been leverage to gain further funds from other sources. Significant effort over the next 5-10 years will be required to achieve success in this demanding field. The project will also need to find a motivated collaborating scientist in Benin to meet the Peanut CRSP requirements.

The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country , depending on their dominant features .	A typology of jobs challenges A country's level of development, institutional strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will thus be different from that in another country, depending on their dominant features. The challenges facing countries as they move along the development path are illustrated by the agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases: * Agrarian countries. Most people are still engaged in agriculture and live in rural areas. Jobs that improve living standards have a substantial development payoff because of high poverty rates. Cities need to be more functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs for development. Even in the most optimistic scenario, however, it may take decades before urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority. * Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Job opportunities for women, typically in light manufacturing, can have positive impacts on the household allocation of resources. Jobs that deepen the global integration of urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good for development. As countries urbanize, congestion, pollution, and other costs of high density become increasingly serious, so Moving jobs center stage 19 that would make the greatest contribution to development in each case. This focus allows for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs between living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers (figure 14).

For rural entrepreneurs, the facilitation of access to market may also take the form of value chain facilitation, including better access to equipment and inputs, as well as opportunities to sell products.

Box 3.4 Learning achievement of girls and boys The main purpose of any education system is to impart skills to young people so that they can effectively participate in the social, economic and political life. Getting children into school is not an end in itself. The ultimate measure of success is not only the extent to which children learn, but the quality of their education experience. Student assessment surveys provide a measure for assessing learning outcomes and the quality of education. Such surveys allow some assessment to be made of the relative achievements of girls and boys in terms of the subjects they study in school. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)--which surveys school performance among 15-yearolds around the world, particularly in reading, mathematics and science--makes it possible to measure disparities among and within countries in terms of the skills students attain after a given period of learning. Typically, this is done after about eight years of schooling, near the end of compulsory education in many countries.

Most of the students of rural schools are unable to attain the primary English language competencies due to prevailing challenges in our education system .	Language is one of the most useful tools we have as humans. Without it we could not think of thoughts expressible to others, nor could we engage in the activities that commonly take place in the society we build ourselves (Di Pietro, 1994). Language is very important in education. The high status of English within a global economy of languages has meant that English language education is increasingly being promoted in international development initiatives. A broad goal of English language programs is that of developing the communicative ability to convey and interpret a message via written or spoken modalities to another person. In our country, there is no doubt that we still have not established a standard of education in schools and colleges. There are too many problems in our country that have to be eradicated to embrace a comprehensive education system through which we can expect ourselves to be a richer nation. We must not forget that students today will become the key members of our country who would be responsible for the overall development of our country. If we do not have good teacher, there is no way we could expect to have a balanced society in future. And if there are not enough good teachers in English, then there would be imbalance that the urban area students will be good at English, but students in rural areas would always be deprived of getting or learning English properly. The main objectives of teaching English in Bangladesh are to enable students to understand simple commands, instructions and requests in English and also carry them out.

Mechanization was required not only in farming but also in various urban industries , and its success resulted in the emigration of workers in their prime of life to urban areas , leaving villages to their wives and to the elderly .	The progress made in various sectors during the 50 years following World War II was so rapid and revolutionary that Japan attained selfsufficiency in rice in the 1970s. Developments were especially remarkable in breeding for cold tolerance and yield; in controlling diseases, pests, and weeds by means of chemicals; and in mechanization of such arduous tasks as tilling, transplanting, applying fertilizers and other chemicals, harvesting, and threshing/drying. During this period, rice yields increased from about 3.3 to 5.0 t/ha and labor required decreased from 2,200 to 500 hours per hectare. This labor efficiency allowed farmers to leave villages to work in urban industries, causing the average age in rural areas to increase rapidly. Mechanization was required not only in farming but also in various urban industries, and its success resulted in the emigration of workers in their prime of life to urban areas, leaving villages to their wives and to the elderly. However, this tendency is not particular to Japan; it is becoming common also in other rice-growing countries.

Technological options must be developed to maintain soil fertility and control pest pressure .	Enhancing productivity and sustainability of favorable environments The major factor in poverty alleviation in recent years has been the reduction in the unit cost of production and the downward trend in real prices of food. Improved technologies were adopted fastest in the favorable irrigated environment, which accounts for nearly 45% of the rice land and more than 70% of total rice production. Because of its importance, we must continue to focus on this favorable environment as the major source of rice supply to meet the growing demand from the expanding urban population and the rural landless. The challenges are how to sustain the high yields already achieved in this ecosystem and whether modern science can be used to explore possibilities of a further shiftin yield potential. The options for extending the area under high-yielding modern rice varieties by developing irrigation infrastructure will no longer be available for many countries because of the looming water crisis. Farmers need assistance from rice scientists on how to grow rice with less water and how to operate irrigation systems more efficiently.

For newer ICTs such as mobile phones and the Internet to convey agricultural information effectively, the content and mode of delivery may need to change, but what about the users themselves? Much has been made of young people's ready adoption of newer ICTs, as well as the capacity of ICTs (newer and older) to break through barriers to the acquisition of information and skills, such as distance, the inability to read and write, or the expense of producing and disseminating audiovisual information. Much has also been made of the potential for interactive ICTs to provide agricultural recommendations tailored to an individual farmer's circumstances. Yet much depends on whether the individual user of ICTs is able to frame relevant questions based on learning acquired in good primary schools, coupled with practice in imagining states of the world other than those already experienced. As discussed in this chapter, educational systems need to deliver high-quality basic education, as well as increase enrollment.

"Key findings included the following:  In the ""ambitious"" scenario for resource needs (based on achievement of the 2030 SDG targets), the additional investment (compared with 2014) required per year grew from US$ 134 billion in 2016 to US$ 371 billion (equivalent to an extra US$ 58 per person) in 2030.  Most of the increased investment required (75% of the total) was for expanding and strengthening the health workforce and health services infrastructure (including buildings and medical equipment) to reach recommended benchmarks. The remainder was for specific priorities, including TB. The largest share of investments needed for specific diseases or programmes was accounted for by noncommunicable diseases.  Overall, health expenditure (in both the ""moderate"" and ""optimistic"" scenarios) was projected to be sufficient to cover ""ambitious"" scenario investment needs in middle-income countries. This is potentially positive news, given that 84% of the estimated burden of TB (in terms of new cases each year) is in middleincome countries. However, given uneven capacity to mobilize additional resources, some countries were expected to face gaps, especially in the first few years. In the period 2026-2030, it was predicted that about five of the 39 middle-income countries included in the analysis would face funding gaps.

In Thailand, the main collaborating institution is Kasetsart University, which benefited in increasing its capacity for socioeconomic research. With support from NCSU PIs, the Thai PIs prepared the survey questionnaires and carried out survey and interviews of former trainees. A stronger partnership was forged between Kasetsart University and North Carolina State University in the socioeconomic area.

What could be the longer term impact of technological change on banking and finance ?	What could be the longer term impact of technological change on banking and finance? Technology will play a big role and could fundamentally change the way that the financial system works. Although it is very difficult to predict exactly how this will play out, both banking and particularly the asset management industry could be particularly ripe for disruption. Advances in digital technology could enable more and more people to move towards self-directed investment using online platforms, fundamentally changing how the current industry works. I see this as a huge growth area going forwards for new entrants. There is also an interesting question as to where technological innovation will come from in future. Traditionally, it has mostly come from areas like Silicon Valley, but with success stories such as Alibaba in China, it may be the case that we will start to see more innovation coming from the East. This will reinforce other factors shifting global economic power in that direction.	What could be the longer term impact of technological change on banking and finance?

Jobs agendas are also connected through the international migration of jobs .	Jobs agendas are also connected through the international migration of jobs. The splintering of production tasks has facilitated their delocalization and outsourcing to developing countries, resulting in greater trade volumes and lower prices of final goods. But it has also led to a global redistribution of jobs in manufacturing, and the same trend is increasingly visible in services as well. So far, the migration of jobs out of industrial countries has mainly affected blue-collar workers, but white-collar jobs are following. These are not once-and-for-all moves. Growing labor costs in Asia may open up opportunities for other developing countries to jump-start industrialization.	Jobs agendas are also connected through the international migration of jobs.

Scientifically-based information and effective tools need to be provided to policy makers and resource managers so that well-informed decisions can be enacted .	Although the prevention and control of IAS present scientific, political, and ethical challenges, the problem can be dramatically reduced through concerted action. Stakeholders need to be made aware of the problem and motivated to address it. Scientifically-based information and effective tools need to be provided to policy makers and resource managers so that well-informed decisions can be enacted. Co-operative programmes need to be forged among governments and other institutions to enable the problem to be addressed in a strategic, holistic, and timely manner. No programme to minimize the spread and impact of IAS will be successful, however, unless it effectively addresses the factors that ultimately drive invasions. IAS are a by-product of human values, beliefs, and behaviours. They are a symptom of a society that is choosing immediate gains over long-term, irreconcilable losses. We must recognize that the way in which we choose to conduct business and live our daily lives will either magnify or minimize the problem (Reaser, 2001).

This is due not only to underdeveloped health systems that are unable to address women 's needs , but also to gender issues .	Adolescence and young adulthood should be a time of general good health with low mortality rates. Yet in developing regions, complications linked to pregnancy and childbirth, as well as sexually transmitted infections, particularly HIV, continue to take a heavy toll on the lives of adolescent girls and young women. This is due not only to underdeveloped health systems that are unable to address women's needs, but also to gender issues. Poor access to information and education, early marriage, and lack of decision-making power among girls who are married or in relationship increase their exposure to sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancies and the risk of unsafe abortion. Traditional gender expectations also exert a harmful effect on men. Adolescent boys and young men often take up habits and risky behaviours that are associated with images of masculinity. During adolescence and young adulthood, road injuries, interpersonal violence and self-harm are the leading causes of death among young men in both developed and developing regions. Injuries are also a leading cause of death among young women in developed regions, although the corresponding mortality rates are much lower than those of young men.

Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased .	Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries. Rates of new firm registration are low in most countries in the region.83 And even when they do get started, small firms face barriers in growing into sizable companies. The vast majority of Tunisian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them are one-person entities, and only 0.4 percent have 100 workers or more. But these large firms account for more than one-third of all jobs, more than all the one-person firms combined. A study of their dynamics over a decade shows that micro-and small firms hardly ever become large firms. Moreover, one-person firms only very rarely graduate into the small size category, and many are likely to shut down.84 While countries with high youth unemployment may face a large youth bulge or education quality issues, problems are often on the demand side, with limited competition reducing employment opportunities, especially for highly skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased. This prospect is unlikely to materialize, however, as long as political connections remain more important than entrepreneurial capacity to enter they would make a major dent in the aggregate unemployment rate is unclear. Better matches between jobseekers and employment opportunities would result in large increases in total employment only if there were many unfilled vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle East and North Africa. Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and by increasing privatization and deregulation.79 Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for the most part.80 The problem is similar with training programs. Educated youth have the capacity to learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could even provide on-the-job training as needed. But training may not change aspirations.	Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased.

In addition , processed food products of animal origin require prior authorization from three government agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock , including the animal and plant health authority AGROCALIDAD , the Undersecretary of Commercialization , and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development .	Ecuador imposes a variety of standards-related measures on certain types of processed food. Executive Decree No. 4522 of 2013 of the Ministry of Public Health's (MSP) National Agency for Regulation, 144 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Control, and Sanitary Surveillance, requires that all processed and packaged food products include a label with a set of colored bars indicating low, medium, or high content of salt, sugar, and fat. Although the government of Ecuador revoked in November 2018 a resolution, COMEX 116, that would require a certificate demonstrating compliance with the labeling provisions, it remains unclear what a transition phase will look like for labeling and conformity assessment of imported food and agricultural products. Implementation of this requirement reduced the imports of dozens of high value added food products from the United States, including preserved meat and vegetable products, jams, sauces, and other food products, because certification is more onerous for imports than for domestic products. In addition, processed food products of animal origin require prior authorization from three government agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, including the animal and plant health authority AGROCALIDAD, the Undersecretary of Commercialization, and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development. For processed meat products, an assessment is conducted by both the Undersecretary of Commercialization and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development, resulting in unnecessary redundancy and delay. The United States will continue to work with Ecuadorian authorities to explore alternatives, including the use of state or federal Certificates of Free Sale, a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity, or a determination of equivalence with the Ecuadorian Service for Standardization's (INEN) requirements.

The ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh has grown rapidly over the past three decades, and the country now ranks among the largest garment exporters in the world. While the early successes have been attributed to an initial technology transfer from the Republic of Korea, such a one-time infusion of knowledge alone is insufficient to explain the sustained growth. In this respect, the pattern of development in Bangladesh is similar to that in East Asia, where investment in human capital and the importation and assimilation of technological and managerial knowledge from advanced countries played a critical role in promoting industrialization.

CHAPTER 7 Different countries face different jobs challenges, but their jobs agendas are interconnected by two forces--the migration of people and the migration of jobs. These two flows have consequences for living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in sending and receiving countries. The arrival of migrants or the outsourcing of jobs abroad affects the living standards of both migrants and locals. The availability of foreign workers, the development of migrant networks channeling savings and ideas, and the arrival of multinational firms bringing more advanced techniques are all bound to increase productivity. But family structures as well as community life are affected by the movement of people and jobs. The potential gains are considerable, but there are also tradeoffs.

The technologies being promoted for production , processing , roasting and making peanut butter are labor intensive and will absorb the available labor in the region .	Training and capacity building have been of major benefit to the HC. Technical staff at the Beacon Foundation have been trained in research methods and maintenance of equipment. Field trials, surveys and workshops were conducted in 2002 and 2003. Field trials and workshops were held in 5 villages in 2004. The better farmers are being trained as trainers to impart knowledge to their peers. There has been a rapid shiftin training emphasis as the production has expanded. Leveraging this project the Beacon Foundation has initiated training of women's groups to process these peanuts and add value. Five village factories have been established. The technologies being promoted for production, processing, roasting and making peanut butter are labor intensive and will absorb the available labor in the region. While roasting, shelling and peanut butter making devices are available, they are undergoing continuous improvements, often with input from the locals. Processing technologies for new products yet to be selected will need to be developed and fitted to local circumstances and the peanut CRSP will be on hand to offer help in those transitions. Women have played a major role in the status of the project and will be a major force behind future success. They organized and led many of the workshops that we visited and were key players in generating questions and stimulating discussions. The demonstration exercise where we were introduced to the use of the shelling, roasting, de-skinning and peanut butter grinding technologies were run mainly by women. The making of the cassava bread which will also be sold in the school feeding program was demonstrated by women.

Diverse jobs agendas 203 problems of scale. Exporting to larger foreign markets is difficult, however, as the disadvantage of smallness manifests itself in the form of higher production costs. Given that small countries are price-takers in world markets, these cost premiums are hard to pass on to customers. The only way these economies can export is by accepting lower profits and labor earnings. But in industries such as electronic assembly and clothing, even if capital earns negative returns and wages are zero, the unit cost of production in a tiny economy would still exceed prevailing world prices. 50 A number of small island nations, especially those located in the Pacific Ocean, are also confronted with the challenge of remoteness. When small islands are located far away from economic Small island nations The jobs agendas of small island nations are shaped by their market size and their geography. Because of their size, these countries cannot exploit economies of scale or reap the benefits of agglomeration or specialization. As islands, many of them are characterized by fragmentation--an already-small population spread thinly over large areas. For example, Fiji has a population of around 860,000 people and a total territory of 18,274 square miles, but this land is fragmented across a total 332 islands. Yet jobs in cities and clusters rely on scale and density to create positive spillovers.

Beijing lawyer Jiang Tianyong, who went missing in November 2016 and ""confessed"" at a trial in August to fabricating the torture account of lawyer Xie Yang by Chinese police and attending overseas workshops to discuss changing China's political system, was sentenced in November to two years' imprisonment for ""inciting subversion of state power"". Hu Shigen and Zhou Shifeng, convicted in 2016, remained imprisoned. Beijing human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, held in incommunicado detention since the beginning of the crackdown, was still awaiting trial at the end of the year, charged with ""subverting state power"". In January, an interview transcript with Xie Yang was published in which he said he faced torture and other ill-treatment during detention. Xie Yang was released on bail without a verdict in May after his trial. On 26 December, the court announced his conviction on the charge of ""inciting subversion of state power"" but ruled that he was ""exempt from criminal punishment"". He remained under surveillance."	"Among the nearly 250 targeted individuals who were questioned or detained by state security agents following the unprecedented government crackdown on human rights lawyers and other activists that started in July 2015, nine were convicted of ""subverting state power"", ""inciting subversion of state power"" or ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble""."

Most rainfed lowland rice farmers are poor and must cope with unstable yields and financial risks. They adapt their cropping practices to the complex risks, potentials, and problems they face. They typically grow traditional, photoperiodsensitive cultivars and invest their labor instead of purchasing inputs. Farmers bund the fields to store water. They weed, may redistribute seedlings to ensure good crop stands, and usually harvest by hand. Suitable modern varieties and associated production technologies have been limited.

In many fields , international scientific cooperation is often the cheapest and most effective way to advance both knowledge and best practices .	In many fields, international scientific cooperation is often the cheapest and most effective way to advance both knowledge and best practices. The last two decades have seen amazingly rapid advances in both our understanding of biological invasions and in political awareness of the problems they cause. For example, the Subsidiary Body on Scientific Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to the Convention on Biological Diversity35 has made IAS a cross-cutting theme. Similar steps are being taken elsewhere for example, at the World Wide Fund for Nature (Cronk & Fuller, 1995), in the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands36, and in the 31 http://www.biodiv.org/programmes/cross-cutting/taxonomy/default.asp 32 http://www.iubs.org 33 http://www.bionet-intl.org/ 34 http://www.issg.org 35 http://www.biodiv.org 36 http://www.ramsar.org International Maritime Organization37. These advances are attributable in no small measure to international cooperation. The efforts of groups such SCOPE, IUCN, and other GISP partners are clearly paying off. In the struggle to manage IAS, promoting international scientific cooperation should be a top priority on all national, regional, and global agendas. Wherever possible this should be done within the framework of existing mechanisms so as to maximize the use of scarce resources. GISP is poised to play a crucial role in this process globally and to build the capacity to minimize the spread and impact of IAS at national and sub-national levels.

Primary product: In Footprint studies, a primary product is the least-processed form of a biological material that humans harvest for use. There is a difference between the raw product, which is all the biomass produced in a given area, and the primary product, which is the biological material humans will harvest and use. For example, a fallen tree is a raw product that, when stripped of its leaves and bark, results in the primary product of roundwood. Primary products are then processed to produce secondary products such as wood pulp and paper. Other examples of primary products are potatoes, cereals, cotton and forage.

However , successful delivery of services requires evidence-based models for educating , deploying , remunerating and managing CHWs to optimize their performance and contribution to the health system across various health service areas .	Several systematic reviews and other studies demonstrate the effectiveness of various types of CHWs in delivering a range of preventive, promotive and curative services related to reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (4-8), infectious diseases (9), noncommunicable diseases (10, 11), and neglected tropical diseases (12). However, successful delivery of services requires evidence-based models for educating, deploying, remunerating and managing CHWs to optimize their performance and contribution to the health system across various health service areas. Other systematic reviews have identified the most effective policy approaches for successful integration of health workers into health systems and the communities they serve. These include providing CHWs with predictable financial and non-financial incentives, frequent supportive supervision, continuous training, and embedding CHWs in health systems and in the communities where they work, with clear roles and communication channels for CHWs (13-17). There is also substantial evidence that delivering essential health services through CHWs may represent a cost-effective approach in a diversity of contexts (18-20). Empowering CHWs also offers a critical opening for change towards achieving greater gender equity within communities. 19 Rationale The support for CHWs and their integration into the health system and in the communities they serve are uneven across and within countries; good-practice examples are not necessarily replicated and policy options for which there is greater evidence of effectiveness are not uniformly adopted.

Given the need to improve the resource-use efficiency in irrigated lowland environments and the success of the Sahel cultivars and integrated crop management (ICM), WARDA implements its research strategy for this environment along the following three lines: * Breeding. In the irrigated lowland environments, breeding uses the enlarged gene pool provided by inter-and intraspecific cultivars. Breeding activities focus on developing high-yielding shortduration cultivars with good grain quality and resistance to major African stresses. Emphasis is being placed on developing varieties that are competitive with weeds in direct-seeded systems. * Further development and extrapolation of ICM practices. ICM decision-support systems developed for the Sahel are being evaluated and disseminated to other areas, in particular to irrigation schemes in northern Nigeria. ICM is being adapted for the medium-input irrigation systems in the International rice research and development 53 (sub-)humid agroecological zones. Potential spillover to the low-to mediuminput rainfed lowland systems is given particular attention. * Identification of INRM practices. To ensure the success of ICM, sound natural resource management practices need to be developed. Particular attention is paid to soil and water management at the farm and water-basin levels and preservation of the natural resource base, that is, maintenance of soil fertility and avoidance of salinity buildup. Senegal is used as a pilot case, taking advantage of the knowledge accumulated on irrigated systems.

Without a political solution, humanitarian needs in Syria will remain high in 2020 and will continue to require a large-scale humanitarian operation, both from within Syria and by cross-border actors. Similar to 2019, the 2020 HRP will have three overarching objectives: i) saving lives; ii) enhancing a protective environment, and iii) supporting the resilience of affected people. Humanitarian organizations will prioritize those with the most acute needs, while addressing multisectoral needs of underserved communities across the country in the most appropriate ways possible, including through market-based interventions. The HRP will draw on comprehensive multisector and sectoral needs assessment and analysis. As the interlinked nature of urgent humanitarian and chronic needs in Syria requires approaches that go beyond the time frame of the HRP, the humanitarian community will also look to deliver rights-based quality programming focused on social service delivery and livelihoods.

Air transport, which accounts for over half the region's arrivals, has greatly improved as an uptick in travel in recent years has led to an increase in the number of air carriers and route capacity. Europe's high concentration of airports and airlines also helps increase competition, thereby driving down airport and ticket prices, improving otherwise relatively low price competitiveness for much of the region. The compact geography of Europe (excluding Eurasia) also makes it ideal for ground transport, which includes high road and railroad density. In addition, regional economic integration, infrastructure and economic heft fuels significant business travel, with Europe hosting more international meetings than the rest of the world combined.

In 2019 , the system migrated to an automated process where the humanitarian data for static locations , temporary facilities and humanitarian movements is transmitted electronically from Yemen for processing and onward transmission to the Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Committee of the Saudi Joint Forces Command .	A Humanitarian Notification System for Deconfliction can assist in protecting humanitarian workers against attacks and the incidental effects of attacks in conflict settings. The notification of humanitarian locations, activities, movements and personnel to the military can help military planners ensure that air strikes or other operations do not result in the inadvertent targeting or harming of humanitarian facilities, activities, convoys or personnel. Such systems are active in numerous contexts, including Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. An example of good practice is the notification system for Yemen, which was first established in 2015. The system is run between operational humanitarian actors inside Yemen, the OCHA office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi-led Coalition. In 2019, the system migrated to an automated process where the humanitarian data for static locations, temporary facilities and humanitarian movements is transmitted electronically from Yemen for processing and onward transmission to the Evacuation and Humanitarian Operations Committee of the Saudi Joint Forces Command. While the use of the notification mechanism is not legally binding and does not guarantee the safety of humanitarian personnel, facilities or convoys, it does aid in promoting the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance in Yemen.

There are two branches of secondary education: general and specialized and technical/vocational. Students in general secondary and specialized secondary education study for three years. Successful students are awarded the Baccalaureat de l'Enseignement secondaire in one of the various streams offered. The Baccalaureat gives access to higher education but some institutions require it to be of a certain type (science, arts, etc.). The objective of technical and vocational secondary education is to prepare students for active life and industry (technicians and qualified workers). Studies last between one and four years, according to the type of training undertaken and can also lead to the Baccalaureat technique and higher education.

In Uganda, where women make up the majority of peanut farmers and do most of the postharvest and processing activities, the Peanut CRSP has linked with the National Association of Women in Uganda (NAWOU) and their suborganizations. NAWOU is providing access to local women's organizations to ensure that they participate in project activities implemented by the University of Ghana. Such linkages should be maintained and strengthened. The research program in Uganda is conducted by a female student from Makerere University and explored the awareness of villagers on the health effects and management of aflatoxin. The study is providing baseline data on the impact of Peanut CRSP technologies prior to education programs to change behavior, and also build socioeconomic research capacity that is much needed in this host country.

Closely related to this interest in understanding how to balance the workload of community health service staff is the interest in determining whether CHWs should be assigned a targeted population size and how this population size might impact CHW productivity , coverage and health outcomes .	Regulatory and legal barriers to CHW career ladders should be considered when designing an appropriate scheme, which should be compatible with the applicable normative environment in a given jurisdiction. 7.10.1 Background to the recommendation Prominent among the many challenges that may result in poor CHW performance is an excessive workload, often indirectly linked to an increased population size served by each CHW (155, 156). The factors in question are the optimal population size or caseload that maximizes the effectiveness of community health workers. While many factors have been highlighted as influencing CHW performance, few studies have actually tested which intervention works best to manage CHW workload and improve CHW performance, and how such interventions should be implemented. Closely related to this interest in understanding how to balance the workload of community health service staff is the interest in determining whether CHWs should be assigned a targeted population size and how this population size might impact CHW productivity, coverage and health outcomes. 7.10.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG recognized the importance of determining an appropriate target population size to maintain a realistic workload and optimize CHW performance. Given the wide variance in CHW roles, the GDG felt the recommendation should focus on the factors that should be taken into account at the national level in setting the optimal target population size. The certainty of the evidence was very low, hence the conditional recommendation.	Closely related to this interest in understanding how to balance the workload of community health service staff is the interest in determining whether CHWs should be assigned a targeted population size and how this population size might impact CHW productivity, coverage and health outcomes.

Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro district: Nova Mambone Communities in Nova Mambone were resettled onto higher ground. Previously their livelihoods had consisted of farming, fishing, informal trading, handicrafts, brewing of traditional alcohol, wood cutting and charcoal making, working on the salt flats, and livestock (cattle). The women did the agricultural work, the trading, and the production of the traditional alcohol. Men worked on the salt flats, fished, and kept livestock. After the floods, the majority of the population received improved housing but had lost their livelihoods. Fishing activities have declined, and farming has been difficult due to the drought. Because of a lack of money in the economy, petty trading has not been revived. The families are mainly surviving on food for work projects two years after the floods. Women continue to try to farm. And some are beginning to keep chickens again. Some of the women said they had started a new business of selling meat from game hunted by the men. Men are unable to find work or alternative income sources so they work on the roads in the food for work programs; they no longer have boats or cattle, as they were lost in the floods. Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro District: Nova Mambone (continued) The positive aspects of the recovery process are that they live in areas that are more secure and people are less vulnerable to future flooding. There has been considerable investment in the economic, commercial and social infrastructure, and the road building has bought greater access to previously isolated areas. Some very remote areas are now reachable by boat, and the ferry has linked two potential markets. The district now has electricity, considered to be an important development step. The improved housing has been very important, as people now have greater access to social infrastructure and water supplies. The attitude of people has changed and people are less aggressive, they are pleased with the new plots and want to maintain the new environment in which they live.

T he Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of diseases, ideas, food crops, and populations between the New World and the Old World following the voyage to the Americas by Christo pher Columbus in 1492. The Old World--by which we mean not just Europe, but the entire Eastern Hemisphere--gained from the Columbian Exchange in a number of ways. Discoveries of new supplies of metals are perhaps the best known. But the Old World also gained new staple crops, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava. Less calorie-intensive foods, such as tomatoes, chili peppers, cacao, peanuts, and pineapples were also introduced, and are now culinary centerpieces in many Old World countries, namely Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries (tomatoes), India and Korea (chili peppers), Hungary (paprika, made from chili peppers), and Malaysia and Thailand (chili peppers, peanuts, and pineapples). Tobacco, another New World crop, was so universally adopted that it came to be used as a substitute for currency in many parts of the world. The exchange also drastically increased the availability of many Old World crops, such as sugar and coffee, which were particularly well-suited for the soils of the New World. The exchange not only brought gains, but also losses.

The 2012-2015 national employment strategy for Coted'Ivoire (Republique de Coted'Ivoire, 2012) seeks to expand employment opportunities for decent work to contribute to poverty reduction. It is based on three pillars: (a) support to private enterprises to foster growth and job creation, (b) investment in human capital and labor productivity, and (c) rationalizing governance of employment policy. A follow-up strategy note was issued in 2013 to outline how sectoral strategies, structural measures, specific programs, and business climate improvements could lead to employment creation. These strategic documents link to an initially announced presidential objective of creating 200,000 jobs per year between 2012 and 2015. A new strategy for 2016-2020 is being finalized.

As such, WHR is especially advantageous for producers and traders of storable agricultural commodities such as grain, sunflower seeds and sugar. In these sectors, the use of stored commodities as collateral represents a solution to enhancing agricultural lending, and provides a valuable addition to the traditional use of real estate and land as loan collateral (Hollinger et al., 2009). For small producers, however, storage fees may be too high. This creates an incentive to pool commodities among small firms to access the WHR system (USAID, 2009).

The WEAI can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture , to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened , and to track progress over time .	ISSN 2040-8188 ISBN 978-1-907194-45-0 The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a new survey-based index designed to measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. The WEAI was initially developed as a tool to reflect women's empowerment that may result from the United States government's Feed the Future Initiative, which commissioned the development of the WEAI. The WEAI can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time. The WEAI is an aggregate index, reported at the country or regional level, based on individual-level data collected by interviewing men and women within the same households. The WEAI comprises two subindexes. The first assesses the degree to which women are empowered in five domains of empowerment (5DE) in agriculture. It reflects the percentage of women who are empowered and, among those who are not, the percentage of domains in which women enjoy adequate achievements. These domains are (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decisionmaking power about productive resources, (3) control of use of income, (4) leadership in the community, and (5) time allocation. The second subindex (the Gender Parity Index [GPI]) measures gender parity. The GPI reflects the percentage of women who are empowered or whose achievements are at least as high as the men in their households. For those households that have not achieved gender parity, the GPI shows the empowerment gap that needs to be closed for women to reach the same level of empowerment as men. This technical paper documents the development of the WEAI and presents pilot data from Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda, so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings.	The WEAI can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time.

Rice farmer resilience: contextual drivers The results presented above illustrate that the majority of rice farmers have limited resilience to climate hazards; they persist in Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ a livelihood system typified by low-productivity rice cropping and ineffective coping strategies. These livelihoods are susceptible to losses from climate hazards and do not generate resources that farmers can utilize in response to climate impacts. This is a partial explanation as to why rice farmers lack resilience; it does not answer what led to this state occurring nor fully explain why it persists. To understand why such a state persists it is necessary to identify the underlying contextual drivers of this situation. We identified four key underlying contextual drivers that generate institutional, social, cultural, and economic feedbacks that reinforce this vulnerable state of rice farming. Our research suggested that these underlying contextual drivers were (i) the institutions surrounding land ownership, (ii) the nature of formal institutional support, (iii) lack of employment diversity, and (iv) expenses related to cultural activities.

This partly also reflects the greater earnings potential offered by tradable cash crops ( compared to other countries ) , and the more diversified and commercialized nature of agricultural activities in Coted'Ivoire ( see Chapter3 ) .	Indeed, there might be increasing reluctance to stay engaged in agriculture at current productivity levels, at least from an aspirational perspective.45 Depending on how the question is asked, two to four in five current farmers in Coted'Ivoire already report to aspire to work outside agriculture.46 This is not surprising as better-off individuals in rural areas tend to be somewhat more diversified or specialized in nonagricultural self-and wage employment, also in Coted'Ivoire (Figure2.9). Nonetheless, the decline in agricultural specialization across the wealth gradient is gradual and even among the wealthiest quintile, still more than two in five farmers are specialized in agriculture. In other countries the decline in the share of agricultural employment across the income quintiles is usually stronger. This partly also reflects the greater earnings potential offered by tradable cash crops (compared to other countries), and the more diversified and commercialized nature of agricultural activities in Coted'Ivoire (see Chapter3). With projected rural poverty rates in Coted'Ivoire still at 57 percent in 2011, it is also consistent with limited off-farm opportunities in the rural economy and its urban centers.

In 2017, GPE launched the assessment for learning (A4L) initiative. A4L provides support at global and regional levels, which, in concert with the funding model requirement and its operationalization through the sector planning process, ensures that GPE's support to measuring learning is a coherent package that contributes to improved national learning assessment systems across DCPs. A4L has supported the development of a toolkit to support diagnostics of learning assessment systems to inform strategies to strengthen these systems.26 It is being piloted in three DCPs--Ethiopia, Mauritania and Vietnam--after which it will be finalized and disseminated. A4L also supports regional assessment networks in the Asia-Pacific region (NEQMAP) and in Sub-Saharan Africa (TALENT) focusing on capacity development, research and knowledge sharing among countries of these two regions. These networks have been instrumental in collecting the information for Indicator 15. To date, A4L has supported the organization of four regional capacity development workshops on technical aspects of learning assessment,27 such as contextual data and reporting and dissemination of results. Through A4L support, the two networks have also undertaken research (on topics such as assessment of transversal competencies, the use and impact of learning assessments and so on) and knowledge sharing (for example, webinars, newsletters and a knowledge portal).

"Adults with already high levels of education participate in adult learning at a higher rate than those with lower educational attainment The data show a strong positive relationship--consistent across countries--between participation in adult education and the level of educational attainment. Adults with already high levels of education participate at a higher rate, while those with lower levels participate at a lower rate (figure 3.20). There are a number of reasons to explain this. For one, demand for training might be higher among individuals with higher levels of education because they already have the skills that facilitate learning, and are more likely to be in jobs that demand ongoing training.

It also does not mean that fostering agriculture will necessarily yield the fastest overall economic growth.

As workers move from jobs in low-productivity farms and obsolete firms to jobs in more dynamic economic units , output increases and the economy moves closer to the efficiency frontier .	"Beyond labor policies 313 QUESTION 9 Creative destruction, the mainstay of economic growth, happens to a large extent through labor reallocation. As workers move from jobs in low-productivity farms and obsolete firms to jobs in more dynamic economic units, output increases and the economy moves closer to the efficiency frontier. Differences in productivity across economic units underlie this creative destruction process. Such differences can reflect a healthy ecosystem driven by competition which offers the basis for efficiencyenhancing job reallocation. Market imperfections and government failures may hinder labor reallocation, however, resulting in a wider dispersion of productivity and many missed opportunities for growth.120 Stringent regulations that obstruct the movement of workers from low-to high-productivity areas or that prevent their separation from obsolete firms are a case in point. These regulations may stem from good intentions, such as containing congestion in cities or providing earnings stability to workers. But their cost in productivity growth can be substantial. Regulations of this kind do not sit on the efficiency ""plateau"" where labor policies are mainly redistributive; they are rather on the cliff, and have unambiguously negative effects on economic efficiency."

Violence against indigenous girls and women cannot be separated from the wider context of discrimination and exclusion to which indigenous peoples as a whole are often exposed in social, economic, cultural and political life. Challenges--such as land dispossession, conflict insecurity, displacement, low rates of birth registration, limited access to culturally appropriate education and health services (including sexual and reproductive health), the lack of access to justice and other essential services, including social services--create conditions that affect their development, human security and the fulfilment of their human rights.39 37 UNFPA, UNICEF, UN-Women, ILO and OSRSG/VAC, May 2013. 38 Statistics Canada, 2013.

"In many societies, the family lineage is carried on by male children. The preservation of the family name is guaranteed through the son(s). Except in a few countries (e.g. Ethiopia), a girl takes her husband's family name, dropping that of her own parents. The fear of losing a name prompts families to wish to have a son. Some men marry a second or a third wife to be sure of having a male child. Among many communities in Asia and Africa, sons perform burial rites for parents. Parents with no male child do not expect to have an appropriate burial to ""secure their peace in the next world"". In almost all religions, ceremonies are performed by men. Priests, pastors, sheikhs and other religious leaders are men of great status to whom society attaches great importance, and this important role for men obliges parents to wish for a male child. Religious leaders have a major involvement in the perpetuation of son preference."	In many societies, the family lineage is carried on by male children.

It first explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration , ranging from the view that human mobility including migration is a security issue , that it is an issue of protection , and that it is a matter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change .	Millions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental stress every year. Disruptions such as cyclones, floods and wildfires destroy homes and assets, and contribute to the displacement of people. Slow-onset processes - such as sea-level rise changes in rainfall patterns and droughts - contribute to pressures on livelihoods, and access to food and water, that can contribute to decisions to move away in search of more tenable living conditions. Advances in meteorological and other sciences which inform about the dynamics and pace of climate change indicate that disruptions ranging from extreme weather events to large scale changes in ecosystems are occurring at a pace and intensity unlike any other known period of time on Earth.2 Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increasingly affect migration and other forms of people moving to manage these changing risks.3 This chapter provides an up-to-date overview of environmental change and the spectrum of human mobility. It first explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration, ranging from the view that human mobility including migration is a security issue, that it is an issue of protection, and that it is a matter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change. The chapter then provides examples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world. It then summarizes recent developments in the international policy sphere on the topic. The conclusion draws out the implications for research, policy and practice.

The courts have been wrestling with a large backlog of cases caused by inefficiencies in the justice system, a shortage of courts and poor quality judicial staff.57 In 2005, the case backlog in district and magistrates' courts was estimated at around 500,000 in both civil and criminal matters.58 The Supreme Court reports a rising trend.59 Efforts to address this have focused on increasing the efficiency of court administration, improving judicial education and diverting cases from the formal justice system through encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution.60 Oversight and accountability are improving. The Supreme Court has oversight over the performance of the judiciary of the subordinate courts. It has the power to investigate allegations against judges, to require regular inspection of the subordinate court and to enforce the judicial code of conduct.

Community meetings can bring together people affected by conflict and crisis ( box 4.10 ) .	Temporary employment programs can provide skills training and access to employment for youth at risk and vulnerable populations, particularly during crises and after conflicts.70 These programs have a mixed record in supporting employability, because they generally involve jobs with low status that rarely lead to future earnings opportunities. But there are indications that programs can be designed to invest in skills with benefits for social cohesion. El Salvador's Temporary Income Assistance Program targets women and youth in areas with high rates of violence. Early results suggest that the program has increased the self-esteem of beneficiaries and reduced the recurrence of violence. 71 Public works programs frequently rely on community participation to identify local projects, providing forums for collective decision making. Community meetings can bring together people affected by conflict and crisis (box 4.10). In Rwanda, meetings for the country's public works program discussed peace building, security, community development, and reconciliation, in addition to project-related issues. In the Republic of Yemen, fuel shortages and price increases in building materials stalled public works activities in 2011. However, communities worked together to find creative solutions to these obstacles, including using local materials and finding alternative modes of transport.72 Participatory aspects of programs can provide a channel for voice of excluded groups. In a survey of participants in Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program--which at 7.6 million beneficiaries is one of the largest public works programs in the world--two-thirds of respondents said that the project had given them the first opportunity ever to be involved in a local meeting. Many participants had not interacted with local government officials prior to the program.73 Employment programs partnering with the private sector can connect people through jobs.	Community meetings can bring together people affected by conflict and crisis (box 4.10).	World Development Report 2013: Jobs	World Bank	2012

"Like the migration patterns of other age groups, child migration spans a broad range of phenomena. To start with the term itself, a child is defined in international law as ""every human being below the age of 18 years, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier"".2 Data on youth migration do not always use this cut-off point, however, so reference is often made to ""youth migration"". The broad term ""migration"" can cover both international and domestic human mobility - movement that is of short duration or lifelong - and both one-way and circular journeys. It can span the range from unproblematic family relocation to traumatic forced displacement caused by the violence of war, attempts at ethnic cleansing or State disintegration.

The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country. We measure the level of tourism service infrastructure through the number of hotel rooms complemented by the extent of access to services such as car rentals and ATMs.	This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency.

Egypt had the fourth-highest TTCI performance improvement in the report, moving up nine places to rank 65th globally. The country benefited from score increases on 11 pillars, and scores on six of these pillars improved at or near double digit rates. Egypt is a global leader in terms of cultural resources (22nd). The country is home to some of the world's most famous landmarks such as the Giza Pyramids Complex, helping it rank 38th in terms of World Heritage cultural sites and fourth regarding cultural tourism online searches. Nevertheless, it was Egypt's improvements on natural resources (97th to 69th) that truly led to its overall improved TTCI score, with the attractiveness of its natural resources moving up 87 spots to 44th position. The country has long been regarded as a prime destination for nature-based activities such as beach resorts, with Egypt's price competitiveness (3rd) attracting tourists seeking inexpensive vacations. There have also been efforts to build upon these strengths with greater prioritization of T&T (37th to 31st) via increased government expenditure (22nd to 18th), enhanced tourism brand strategy (60th to 5th) and improved air (55th) as well as ground and port (64th) infrastructure. Natural resources might have also been made more appealing due to improvements on environmental regulatory enforcement and stringency (98th) and the sustainability of T&T development (53rd), though it's widely acknowledged that more needs to be done.

The irrigated rice ecosystem, which accounts for about half of the harvested rice area and contributes three-quarters of global rice production, is concentrated mostly in the humid and subhumid subtropics and humid tropics.

How do you measure biocapacity and how do you determine how much is available? Biocapacity per person is calculated by taking the total amount of bioproductive land worldwide and dividing it by world population. It is a globally aggregated measure of the amount of land and sea area available per person to produce crops (cropland), livestock (grazing land), timber products (forest) and fish (fishing grounds), and to support infrastructure (built-up-land). A nation's biocapacity may include more global hectares than the nation has actual hectares if its land and sea area are highly productive. Biocapacity assessments reflect technological advancements that increase yields, as the conversion of hectares into global hectares takes into account productivity.

"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month? Such are the questions you will encounter when calculating your personal Ecological Footprint online. At the end of the quiz, you are presented with the number of global hectares needed to support your given lifestyle.

When Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up with Bangladesh 's Desh Ltd. to produce garments for export in Bangladesh in 1979 , the South Asian country had no modern industry .	The garment industry in Bangladesh illustrates how important it is to learn advanced management practices, marketing, and technologies from abroad. When Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up with Bangladesh's Desh Ltd. to produce garments for export in Bangladesh in 1979, the South Asian country had no modern industry. Little more than 20 years later, the industry was generating more than US$12.5 billion in export revenue. Women accounted for 80 percent of its 3.6 million workers Arguably, a wide set of factors, from financial innovation to policy support, contributed to this development success. But it began in 1979, when Desh sent 130 newly recruited, educated employees to Daewoo's garment factory in Korea, where they participated in an eight-month intensive training course covering topics from sewing skills to factory management, quality control, and international procurement and marketing--skills that they then applied in the Desh factories in Bangladesh. Within a few years, almost all the trainees had left Desh to start their own garment businesses. Some of the ex-Desh workers joined new garment factories established by affluent businessmen, while others founded trading houses, which then BOX 3.4 What explains the boom in the garment industry in Bangladesh? contributed to the proliferation of garment manufacturers by providing a variety of valuable services including international procurement and marketing, sample making, and design reengineering.

Increased efficiency of labor resource utilization will become a paramount issue as the ravages of the HIV epidemic impact labor resources in developing countries , and reduced use of pesticides will impact positively on environment preservation .	Approaches: Production efficiency projects are based on scientific research approaches designed to increase production especially under conditions of low or minimized input use. In lesser-developed countries, technologies that exploit genetic resistances or avoidance mechanisms are most likely to impact on peanut production by resourcepoor farmers. These same approaches are the ones most likely to provide benefits to the U.S., where chemical inputs are a major cost and where lowering costs of production is an important requirement for the farmers to remain competitive. Increased efficiency of labor resource utilization will become a paramount issue as the ravages of the HIV epidemic impact labor resources in developing countries, and reduced use of pesticides will impact positively on environment preservation. In East/Southern Africa, collaboration with ICRISAT has guided the approach. ICRISAT has been developing varieties with early maturity and resistance to Groundnut Rosette Virus disease (GRV) and the Peanut CRSP has worked both upstream (evaluating variability) and downstream enabling the national programs to test and release adapted varieties. In this cluster a number of projects are utilizing or developing biotechnology tools to allow for improved efficiency of crop improvement (gene-probes/markers and genetic manipulation) to access and evaluate novel genes that have the potential to provide solutions to otherwise intractable problems. 2. Outputs/achievements: 2.1. Technical In many cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies. These include improved germplasm and varieties, improved production practices, new techniques and interventions, and improvement of institutional and human resource capacity. 2.1.1 Genetic Improvement Improved varieties and useful germplasm have been released, developed or identified in a number of projects (UFL 16, TAM17, UGA28, NMX53): Disease resistant varieties in experimental plots in Ghana.

At the end of the two-year period, students sit for the general secondary examination (Tawjihi) in the appropriate branch and those who pass are awarded the Tawjihi (General Secondary Education Certificate). The academic stream qualifies students for entrance to universities or the job market, provided they pass the two additional subjects. 2) Vocational secondary education, which provides intensive vocational training and apprenticeship, and leads to the award of a certificate (not a Tawjihi).

Asia is increasingly doing business in Africa , particularly China , where there is great demand for the continent 's raw materials .	English language quantitative indicators ! Euromonitor International Page 8 Global changes underpin growth of English Throughout the research respondents from private companies stated that English is now the common global language of communication. Levels of English use in Nigeria and Pakistan, for example, are high. This is underpinned by strong historical and cultural relationships with the UK, and driven by a desire for linguistic unity, resulting in a competitive advantage globally. Asia is increasingly doing business in Africa, particularly China, where there is great demand for the continent's raw materials. English is used commonly among these developing countries as a means of bridging the frequently massive linguistic differences. Companies such as MTN Communications and Microsoft have found that both Nigeria and Pakistan offer a more attractive business environment than many other countries as a result of these countries' higher levels of English proficiency, among other factors. English considered important to economic growth English levels are less developed in Bangladesh, Cameroon and Rwanda. However, these countries recognise that a standard language of communication is essential for doing business. In the case of Cameroon and Rwanda, French remains a dominant presence throughout society, from education to business; however, these countries are taking active steps to improve English communication by providing more education in English, and in the case of Rwanda, by shifting the government and education system entirely from French to English. However, both governments believe that English will help increase economic growth, allowing businesses to trade with more countries. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has been promoting the virtues of doing business with Rwanda in the US, Europe and China, by specifically referring to the growing use of English. Most companies interviewed said that staff with English language skills had a strong advantage over other employees. For each of the five researched countries, around two-thirds of interviewees stated that employees with English language skills progress more quickly within the company and that English is beneficial for company growth.

Efforts to suppress the illicit production and supply of drugs , when properly designed and implemented , are essential tools for reducing the social and health damage resulting from illicit drug markets .	"29. In any drug control system, supply reduction and the enforcement of regulations will always be an important element of an integrated and balanced approach. Efforts to suppress the illicit production and supply of drugs, when properly designed and implemented, are essential tools for reducing the social and health damage resulting from illicit drug markets. 30. In recent years, some criticisms have singled out efforts to suppress the illicit supply and use of drugs, claiming that they are failed policies on the grounds that drug abuse remains prevalent. The logic behind that argument is questionable. Nobody has advocated abandoning the global response to AIDS or hunger because those problems have not been eliminated. Rather, those efforts are held to be the more reasonable standards for improving the situation, compared with the alternative of inaction. 31. All other things being equal, higher prices--which may result from a more restricted illicit supply due to law enforcement efforts--will lead to reduced demand. But higher drug prices can affect not only the problems associated with drug-taking but also the problems associated with drug trafficking and with law enforcement efforts. Where the extent of the trafficking falls less than proportionally to the increase in prices, more vigorous law enforcement activity may increase the total revenue available to traffickers and thus increase the incentive to engage in that illicit trade and to struggle for dominance within that trade. 32. Law enforcement policy therefore needs to be carefully designed, keeping in mind both the objective of drug control and the possible unintended results. It is not the case that the world must choose between ""militarized"" drug law enforcement and the legalization of non-medical use of internationally controlled drugs. The conventions do not mandate a ""war on drugs""."

By reallocating workers from stagnant or slowly growing economies to rapidly growing ones , the international migration of workers contributes to the reduction in the QUESTION 7 Many developing countries face a jobs agenda .	There are also hidden losers. These are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries which have failed to develop new industries and services connected to world markets and the jobs that go with them.59 Workers in those countries, however, may not perceive the lost employment opportunities.60 One way to mitigate the welfare losses from globalization, both apparent and hidden, is through the international migration of workers. Income differentials across countries, which reflect differences in the growth rates of different economies, are important drivers of this migration. By reallocating workers from stagnant or slowly growing economies to rapidly growing ones, the international migration of workers contributes to the reduction in the QUESTION 7 Many developing countries face a jobs agenda. In some, it involves offering avenues to rural populations to move out of poverty. In others, it aims at leveraging the gains from urbanization and from integration in global markets. Yet in others, the goal is to prevent youth from becoming disenfranchised or to reduce the risk of conflict. These agendas are addressed through national policies that stimulate job creation by the private sector, especially in the areas and activities where development payoffs are highest. But jobs agendas of individual countries are connected through globalization: trade in goods and services, investment flows, and migration of workers. This begs the question: if jobs can migrate from one country to another, do policies to support job creation in one country become policies affecting jobs in other countries--policies competing for jobs globally? Among economists, the conventional wisdom is that the number of jobs is not determined by international trade and investment but by the total number of people in the labor force. And in general, openness to international trade and foreign direct investment is beneficial for all the countries involved. Thus, globalization is not a zero-sum game. From this point of view, policies to support job creation are not policies competing for jobs, even as they may alter the global flows of trade, investment, and workers.

Tourist Service Infrastructure ( 4 indicators ) : The availability of sufficient quality accommodation , resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country .	The Infrastructure subindex captures the availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy and includes 3 pillars: 10. Air Transport Infrastructure (6 indicators): Air connectivity is essential for travellers' ease of access to and from countries, as well as movement within many countries. In this pillar we measure the quantity of air transport, using indicators such as available seat kilometres, the number of departures, airport density and the number of operating airlines, as well as the quality of air transport infrastructure for domestic and international flights. 11. Ground and Port Infrastructure (7 indicators): The availability of efficient and accessible transportation to key business centres and tourist attractions is vital for the T&T sector. This requires a sufficiently extensive road and railroad network, proxied by road and railroad densities, as wells as roads, railroads, and ports infrastructure that meet international standards of comfort, security and modal efficiency. The pillar also accounts for unpaved roads, which enable local connections, and to some extent, can proxy the existence of picturesque roads, which can, in very specific contexts, attract tourists. 12. Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country. We measure the level of tourism service infrastructure through the number of hotel rooms complemented by the extent of access to services such as car rentals and ATMs.	Tourist Service Infrastructure (4 indicators): The availability of sufficient quality accommodation, resorts and entertainment facilities can represent a significant competitive advantage for a country.

Diverse examples of adaptive behaviour are presented from different ecological zones particularly at risk under climate change, namely, mountainous, dryland and coastal areas, as well as cities. The examples address a variety of strategies that promote one or several adaptive forms of migration.

For example , among women who sought help in the United Republic of Tanzania ( 2010 ) , 47 per cent appealed to family , 6 per cent to the police , and 1 per cent to a doctor or other medical personnel .	Only a fraction of women who experience violence seek help. The proportion of women who did seek help from family, friends or institutions such as health services and the police ranged from 18 per cent in Mali (2012-2013) to over 70 per cent in Georgia (2010) (figure 6.13). In the majority of countries, less than 40percent of the women who experienced violence sought help of any sort. Among women who did, most looked to family and friends as opposed to the police and health services. For example, among women who sought help in the United Republic of Tanzania (2010), 47 per cent appealed to family, 6 per cent to the police, and 1 per cent to a doctor or other medical personnel.68 In Jordan (2012), 84 per cent looked to their family for support and 2 per cent went to the police.69 In general, only a small proportion of women who sought help did so by appealing to the police. In almost all countries with available data, the percentage of women who sought help from the police, out of all women seeking help for experience of violence, was less than 10 per cent (figure 6.14). These findings underscore the assumption that, in the vast majority of instances, violence goes unreported and administrative records are not appropriate for assessing the prevalence of violence. One reason women may be reluctant to speak to the police about their experience of violence may be the low representation of women among police personnel. Women make up less than 35 per cent of police personnel in all 86 countries and areas for which data are available, and less than 10 per cent in 26 of these countries.70 Yet, even when women do seek help, they often face formidable barriers. These include: lack of awareness of or actual lack of services; lack of accessibility to services due to linguistic, cultural, physical or financial constraints; fear of reprisals by the offender as well as family and community members; reluctance due to shame or embarrassment; the potential impact on women's custody of children; fear of reliving the experience of 68 ICF International, 2014. 69 ibid. 70 UNODC, 2015. violence by testifying before the courts; the feeling that the police could do nothing to help; and wanting to keep the incident private.71 .

The acquisition of behavioral skills demanded by formal firms as well as conducive to success in self-employment is an area of global policy interest. International evidence has suggested that behavioral skills remain malleable for longer, providing opportunities to train youths even after they dropped out of school. Evidence from Uganda or Liberia has suggested positive results of delivering behavioral skills training as a complement to technical or business skills training, particularly for women (see Box 6.4). More recent approaches attempt to leverage mentors or role models in behavioral skills training delivery. There again, careful attention to the curriculum, as well as its delivery, would be essential. Box 6.4: Learn. Work. THRIVE: ADOLESCENT GIRLS INITIATIVE PILOTS HELP YOUNG WOMEN TRANSITION TO PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT More than one-third of all youth are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) and across all regions of the world young women are worse off than young men. Although the gender gap in school enrollment has been closing, these gains have not yet translated into gains in secure, paid employment. Reaching girls during adolescence is critical because decisions made and behaviors established during this period affect their horizons later in life. To this end the WorldBank launched the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) to understand how to help young women transition to productive employment and has now implemented pilots in Afghanistan, Haiti, Jordan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, and South Sudan.

More concerted work is needed in international funding and technical agencies to assess the nature and severity of associated IAS risks and to support development of better prevention methods and stronger national and international quarantine systems.24 Quarantine systems are theoretically broad enough to cover all introductions that can involve the transfer of pests (e.g. passengers, mail, Internet transactions, means of transport). However, national systems vary widely in capacity and resources (inspection facilities, taxonomic capacity, access to information). Many smaller nations lack the resources to operate comprehensive quarantine and risk assessment systems. Moreover, national systems mainly focus on international boundaries and rarely cover movements between regions of the same country except for high-risk agricultural and forestry pests.

Evidence from around the world indicates that an early start in education can improve children's chances of participating in and completing higher levels of education. Thus, it can potentially reduce social inequality by offsetting social, economic and language- based disadvantages.4 Early childhood care and education is a diverse area of learning. It ranges, on the one hand, from formal pre-primary education, which is integrated into the national education system via kindergartens where care, play and education are all included, to more informal and often home-based activities. Pre-primary programmes are typically designed for children aged 3 to 5 years, and include organized learning 4 UNESCO, 2010.

Obstacles notwithstanding, entrepreneurial capacity varies substantially across microenterprises and small firms. A distinction is often made between innovative or transformative entrepreneurs and replicative or subsistence entrepreneurs.67 The former correspond to Schumpeterian type of entrepreneurs, while the latter, who generally manage micro-and small enterprises, are followers. Such a distinction, however, does not capture the broader gradation of managerial performance that lies between the transformative and subsistence extremes. A study of the number of management practices adopted by the owners of micro-and small enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa reveals a large variation of management scores (figure 3.15). These scores are closely associated with business performance.68 A broad dispersion of management scores is also found among relatively larger firms in India.69 An emerging literature confirms the importance of management practices in explaining firm productivity.

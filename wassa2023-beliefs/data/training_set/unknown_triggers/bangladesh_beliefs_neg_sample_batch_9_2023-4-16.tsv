There are four major cultural conditions in the flood-prone environments for which rice varieties are selected : deepwater ( up to 100 cm or more ) ; very Deepwater rice in Cambodia .	The cropping systems vary depending on the time, depth, and duration of flooding. Most varieties of rice can survive complete submergence for only 3 to 4 d and some rainfed lowland rice can survive up to 10 d. In floodprone areas, rice is the only food crop that can be grown during the rainy season (June to November in most of Asia).

Prepare in advance to make your trip smoother and more productive. * Schedule meetings before leaving the United States. Determine whether an interpreter will be required and, if so, make all necessary arrangements before arriving. Business language is generally more technical than the conversational speech that many travelers can handle--and mistakes can be costly. The U.S. Commercial Service can assist in locating qualified translators. * Prepare new business cards in as many languages and sizes as necessary. In most countries, exchanging business cards at the first meeting is considered good business manners. As a matter of courtesy, it is best to carry business cards printed both in English and, if applicable, in the language of the country being visited. * Prepare for different weather conditions. Seasonal weather conditions in the countries being visited are likely to be different from conditions in the United States. * Address health care issues. Plan appropriately with respect to prescription drugs, health insurance, vaccinations, and other matters, including dietary needs and preferences. * Find out about the electrical current in each of your destinations.

These could be large significant events such as weddings or repeat small-scale household expenditures , e.g ., for medicine .	Expenses related to cultural activities Households struggling to access food via rice farming strategies remained saddled with other income stresses. These could be large significant events such as weddings or repeat small-scale household expenditures, e.g., for medicine. Weddings presented households with substantial costs, but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor. As a result, scarce financial resources were not invested into enhancing returns from rice farming. For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13). The costs of weddings often exceeded rice farmers' financial capabilities, resulting in loan taking or sales of land. The knock-on effect is reduced investment in rice cropping, increased loan taking, or asset sales serving to reduce rice cropping households' long-term climate resilience.

Outside of agriculture, microenterprises and household businesses account for a large share of employment in a majority of developing countries. These businesses make a significant contribution to gross job creation and destruction, although not necessarily to net job creation and productivity growth.

"Reducing pesticide use is one of the best ways to protect fish and wildlife resources. Using sound cultural practices reduces pest problems and, therefore, results in lower pesticide use. Cultural practices that decrease the need for pesticides include rotating crops, selecting resistant varieties (when possible), planting and harvesting at the proper time, and using integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. IPM is a farming approach that employs alternative methods of pest control, rather than relying solely on agrichemicals. With IPM, pesticides are used only when the cost of applying a pesticide is outweighed by the cost of pest damage to the crop. This ""threshold"" must be reached before chemical pest control is economically justified. In this way, IPM practices help to reduce pesticide use and protect wildlife and the environment."

Recent, rigorous assessment of the (short-term) spillover effects from new large farm establishments in Mozambique also points to limited beneficial effects on neighboring smallholders within 25 to 50 kilometers.68 The limited indirect effects reported in Mozambique are furthermore limited to the adoption of better agronomic practices and accessing modern inputs, but were not found to extend to employment generation or output market participation and are counterbalanced by a decrease in perceived welfare. As in Brazil, this recent experience from Mozambique underscores once again that more and better jobs from large-scale commercial agricultural production units remain often far and few between.

For example, a fallen tree is a raw product that, when stripped of its leaves and bark, results in the primary product of roundwood.

Irreversible damage to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they provide , worsened by air , soil , water , and marine pollution .	Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond. Climate hazards such as extreme weather, higher temperatures, droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, sea level rise, soil degradation, and acidifying oceans are intensifying, threatening infrastructure, health, and water and food security. Irreversible damage to ecosystems and habitats will undermine the economic benefits they provide, worsened by air, soil, water, and marine pollution.  Extreme weather events, many worsened by accelerating sea level rise, will particularly affect urban coastal areas in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Damage to communication, energy, and transportation infrastructure could affect low-lying military bases, inflict economic costs, and cause human displacement and loss of life.  Changes in the frequency and variability of heat waves, droughts, and floods--combined with poor governance practices--are increasing water and food insecurity around the world, increasing the risk of social unrest, migration, and interstate tension in countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, and Jordan.  Diminishing Arctic sea ice may increase competition--particularly with Russia and China-- over access to sea routes and natural resources. Nonetheless, Arctic states have maintained mostly positive cooperation in the region through the Arctic Council and other multilateral mechanisms, a trend we do not expect to change in the near term. Warmer temperatures and diminishing sea ice are reducing the high cost and risks of some commercial activities and are attracting new players to the resource-rich region. In 2018, the minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic was 25 percent below the 30-year average from 1980 to 2010. Regional threats .

The research is guided by four main questions: 1. Impact: What does the existing literature suggest about the impact of women's leadership on the humanitarian sector and humanitarian assistance, specifically in locally led humanitarian action? Particular attention was paid to documenting the effectiveness of women's leadership in humanitarian action by looking at the results of efforts made by local humanitarian actors to support gender-transformative action. Definitions of women's leadership and gender-transformative action are to follow. 2. Current Engagement: How are women and women's organizations involved in the humanitarian sector and in situations of locally led humanitarian action? 3. Barriers and Challenges: What barriers and challenges do women and women's organizations face in their participation in the humanitarian sector, and specifically in LHL? In what ways does LHL constrain, if at all, women's leadership? 4. Opportunities: Does LHL encourage women's leadership? How does this compare across the country case studies? 10 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan a. Are there opportunities for advancing women's leadership in locally led humanitarian action? If so, under what conditions? b. What enables women and women's organizations to successfully engage in the humanitarian sector and locally led humanitarian action? These questions test the extent to which women's leadership features in locally led humanitarian action, and the extent to which it needs to feature to ensure a truly transformed humanitarian system and effective response. The findings from these questions go toward the body of evidence on LHL, and specifically turn a feminist lens on LHL. The findings also help identify how women's leadership can be better incorporated into efforts to alleviate a consistent problem: the patriarchal humanitarian system's inadequate response to women's gender-based needs and disregard for women's agency. This report presents exploratory research on an understudied area that can be used to develop robust research questions and hypotheses in the future.	The research is guided by four main questions: 1.

"The 2001 survey on consumers' preferences in the Philippines showed that peanut butter was the bestliked product; 66% of the families preferred stabilized peanut butter; and over 90% of respondents were willing to pay more (about PhP1) for Vitamin A-fortified peanut butter. Eight new and improved peanut-based products were developed and/or commercialized in the Philippines in partnership with medium-sized private food industry and micro-and small-scale Project UGA04 - 270 - enterprises, mostly owned by women, and farmers' cooperatives: (1) natural and stabilized (new) peanut butter, (2) Vitamin A-fortified peanut butter (commercialized), (3) chocolate peanut spread (to be commercialized); (4) peanut based sauces such as ""satay"" sauce, ""kare-kare"" sauce, and ""satay"" sauce, (5) peanut praline (commercialized), (6) chocolate peanut bar (commercial product improved), (7) garlic flavored roasted peanuts (commercialized), and (8) peanut ""polvoron"" (new and optimized). Improved processing methods for the optimization, sensory profiling, packaging, and shelf-life testing of these peanut-based products were standardized with assistance from the U.S. Project Investigator. Collaborating scientists, industry groups, and micro/small business entrepreneurs, who were mainly women, were trained successfully on these processes. These techniques are already adopted by the Philippine participating institutions. A successful effort was carried out to transfer to the Philippine food industry and to Cooperatives and Grassroots Business Organizations (micro-and small-scale enterprises) the improved post-harvest processing and packaging technologies. This included the Peanut CRSP developed manual sorting technology that significantly reduced aflatoxin content of peanut-based products.

The production and export of cash crops , especially cocoa , but also of coffee , cotton , and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Coted'Ivoire 's economy and job creation .	Fourth, global demand for Coted'Ivoire's agricultural export commodities points to continuing opportunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. The extent to which Engel's Law acts as a constraint on the demand for a country's agricultural products (and labor), depends also on the tradability of its agriculture, the evolution of global (as opposed to domestic) demand, and the country's comparative advantage. The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity, the less constrained the country is by domestic demand and the larger is its agriculture's potential for generating jobs. The production and export of cash crops, especially cocoa, but also of coffee, cotton, and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Coted'Ivoire's economy and job creation. They also feed other sectors of the economy, particularly agro-processing, commerce, and transportation and contribute importantly to formal wage job creation, many of them low skilled (Chapter5).

"Students can ask themselves questions such as "" How can we observe people in their authentic environment and reflect on their needs ?"	"69. Design has been defined in many ways. Design could mean the creation of artefacts, it could mean problem-solving activity, it could mean a way of reasoning, reflecting and creating meaning (Johansson-Skoldberg et al., 2013). For the purpose of developing a curriculum for entrepreneurship, Boni et al. (2009, p.409) defined design as ""a process of actions and decisions aimed at producing products, services, environments, and systems that addresses a problem and improves people's lives"", i.e. an inherently action-based approach to value creation. Brown (2008) pictures design thinking as a team-based iterative three-step process of 1) being inspired by the world through observing it closely looking for problems and opportunities, 2) brainstorming around plausible ideas for concepts that can help people and 3) testing these ideas on users through prototypes. Design thinking focuses on a creative search for what might be, instead of being limited by what is and what ""should"" be (Dunne and Martin, 2006). For teachers, design thinking represents yet another field where an emerging set of practices, tools and methods could be transferred and contextualized to an educational setting, supporting student learning and creativity. Students can ask themselves questions such as ""How can we observe people in their authentic environment and reflect on their needs?"" and ""How can we solve their problems differently from anyone else?""."

This chapter is aimed in particular at those who would benefit from some broad guidance on this topic .	This chapter on migration research and analysis is focused on point 1 above - for without statistics and other data and research on migration, any attempts at evidence-based decision-making are futile. The evidence for policymaking that originates from rigorous analysis and research on migration is the prime source and starting point for migration policymakers. It is also fundamental to migration practitioners, students, scholars and the public, as they examine aspects of migration and how they might be changing. A key challenge for many is how to determine the relevance and quality of an ever-growing body of migration research and analysis. It can often be overwhelming to identify what is important, and what should be afforded weight, when faced with virtual mountains of research output.

In light of the historical enrollment patterns, educational attainment remains modest among the youth of working age in Coted'Ivoire. According to the national employment survey collected in February 2014, over 50 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 34 lack a complete primary education. Approximately 37.5 percent have no education and 17.5 percent have not completed primary school. This reflects the low primary enrollment rates over the last 30 years --for example, in the early 1990s gross enrollment was below 70 percent. So while enrollment rates have improved, there is still a deficit of human capital in the current working-age population, even among those in the younger cohorts. Recent improvements in enrollment will benefit the next generations of youths entering the working-age population, and the overall education profile of the working-age population will take time to change substantially.

N um be r of E ar th s Source: Global Footprint Network (2008) Part 2 Ecological accounting Living space is measured on a similar scale (1.4 gha per capita). Considerably more than half of the per capita Footprint originates through carbon dioxide emissions, i.e., through the energy used for transportation, manufacturing and heating. A great potential for energy efficiency can be deduced from these numbers. For instance: the Footprint of a normal Berlin rental property could be reduced by approximately four global hectares by insulating its facades. That is an area the size of the Nicolas Lake in the district of Zehlendorf - for one single house. Comparing the results for different forms of transportation is especially compelling. Someone who uses the subway to get to work requires 200 times less area than someone who sits alone in his car. In other words, there is considerable room for making Berlin more livable and more competitive internationally through improving the technical aspects of its buildings, urban planning and infrastructure design.

The provision of incentives has a direct impact on the effectiveness and sustainability of a health programme. It is normally assumed that it improves service delivery through enhanced employee motivation and reduced attrition (127). Choosing effective incentives for CHWs represents a longstanding policy issue within the field of primary health care; incentives can vary from providing a salary or other financial remuneration, such as performance-based incentives, to provision of non-financial incentives (87). To determine the best approach, it is important to understand both CHW and supervisor perspectives about the factors, financial or otherwise, that best motivate CHWs, as well as broader aspects, including duration and scope of CHW training, and level of effort in their role. Decisions on provision of incentives have to be consistent with broader employment and labour legislation and principles. However, there appears to be no clear agreement on which strategies would best support CHW payment in ways that are beneficial (128), and policies and practices vary considerably in this respect across and within countries. 7.7.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG approached this question from the perspective of exploring whether practising CHWs should be offered a financial package for their work and, if so, of which type.	Choosing effective incentives for CHWs represents a longstanding policy issue within the field of primary health care; incentives can vary from providing a salary or other financial remuneration, such as performance-based incentives, to provision of non-financial incentives (87).

As a result , public support is necessary to develop biological and chemical technologies .	While the intensification of crop-based agriculture has been associated with a significant increase in the use of inorganic fertilizer, the application of fertilizer per hectare is far lower in Sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region of the world. One of the major reasons is the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices. Fertilizer prices are usually two to three times higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and Latin America because of poor infrastructure and trade logistics.13 Another major constraint on fertilizer application is the lack of credit for smallholders, given that land ownership titles are seldom secured and hence cannot be used as collateral.14 Therefore, productivity growth in agriculture also requires a favorable investment climate including improved access to infrastructure and credit.15 troducing new varieties and so tend not to make the effort.

In 2003, Kasetsart University in Thailand (UGA37) trained 163 villagers (mainly women) on peanut sorting technology to reduce aflatoxin, and on processing of traditional and new peanut products (i.e., roasted peanuts, honey-roasted peanut butter, and peanut patties). Trained villagers initiated village-level enterprises that are producing aflatoxin-free peanut products with better packaging. These enterprises are the main source of cash income of women.

As firms' employment increases, they fall under the purview of a growing number of regulations.121 The Industrial Disputes Act (Ida) of 1947 is particularly restrictive. Governing employee-employer relationships, the IDA makes it extremely difficult for firms to terminate employment.122 The stringency of labor regulations is consistent with the ""missing middle"" phenomenon, characteristic of India and other developing countries, where medium-size businesses make up a disproportionately small share of the total. Also consistent with the stringency of labor regulations is the substantial dispersion of productivity. If the dispersion observed within each industry narrowed to the point of matching the dispersion observed in the United States, India's average productivity in manufacturing could increase by more than half.123 Instead, despite India's buoyant economic growth during the past two decades, the performance of the labor-intensive manufacturing sector has been sluggish.124 The bulk of the growth in nonfarm employment has been in the informal sector."

A Glossary of frequently used terms in the Atlas and in this report is included in Appendix A.	"The global Regulatory Atlas in fall 2016, NCSBN hosted the landmark Regulation 2030 conference. Regulation 2030 brought together nursing regulators and leaders from eight countries, nursing professional organizations, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and other groups. These attendees were tasked with mapping the future of nursing regulation in the following categories: (a) governance, (b) processes, (c) licensure and registration, (d) workforce, (e) education, (f) fitness for practice, and (g) technology. The Regulation 2030 Conference identified data, collaboration, and standardization as major thematic requirements that would enable the evolution of nursing regulation. Specifically, participants imagined the harmonization of regulatory processes around the world, including the optimized capture and sharing of data across nations and continents. As a step toward future outcomes, and keeping with the recognition of data sharing, collaboration, and standardization as keys to delivering those outcomes, NCSBN determined that there was no efficient method for comparing the governance and processes by which nurses are regulated around the world. Therefore, a single resource containing data on the state of nursing regulation in each country that was digital, searchable, and allowed easy comparison across jurisdictions was needed. This resource ultimately became known as the Global Regulatory Atlas. This special issue, ""Global Profile of Nursing Regulation, Education, and Practice,"" summarizes the rich data contained within Global Regulatory Atlas into an enlightening anthology that captures the similarities, differences and details of nursing around the world. A Glossary of frequently used terms in the Atlas and in this report is included in Appendix A. This data is presented in two parts. Part I reports data and findings from a global perspective. Part II reports this data from a regional perspective. Note that some jurisdictions or regions do not have data listed in every category for various reasons, including that the data were not available or collected and documented in their region."

While global awareness is important to keep momentum going after the launch, more intense promotion of the guideline and uptake support is needed in the countries where it would have the most impact. * Concrete mapping suggestions should be developed on how to most effectively implement the guideline recommendations at the country level, as per segmentation of countries, including action plan templates. 9.2 Plans for guideline adaptation, implementation and evaluation In order to maximize the opportunities for the guideline to be implemented, it will need to be adapted and contextualized, including through a number of derivative products made available in relevant languages to promote uptake at country level.

The United States seeks to clarify the varieties of grapes that are allowed to make fine wine , the types of sugars that may be added to wine for sweetening , and pesticides that are permitted in the production process .	In May 2016, Brazil notified to the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) a draft technical regulation to set the official identity and quality standards for wine and derivatives of grape and wine products. The U.S. Government and industry submitted comments on the draft regulation in July 2016. Previous drafts of this measure were notified to the TBT Committee in 2010 and 2015. U.S. industry remains concerned that Brazil's definitions of wine coolers and wine cocktails are overly trade restrictive and do not allow for the addition of colors, aromas, and flavors that are already permitted in spirits-based beverages. There are also concerns with the measure's analytical parameters for laboratory analysis that do not correlate with the safety and quality of the product. The United States seeks to clarify the varieties of grapes that are allowed to make fine wine, the types of sugars that may be added to wine for sweetening, and pesticides that are permitted in the production process.

They perform important ecological services, such as fish nurseries, which support marine fisheries globally, storm buffering, and absorption of nutrients and sediments, which if discharged directly in the oceans cause algal blooms and oxygen-dead zones (Vorosmarty et al. 2009). Yet deltas are highly vulnerable to climate hazards (Ericson et al. 2006). Many of those resident in developing country deltas have mixed livelihoods based on rice or shrimp farming and fishing, and are highly susceptible to hazard impacts, yet we know little about what makes these farmers resilient to impacts.

More evidence of corruption can , perversely , be an indication of success : systems working better detect more of it .	Lessons from civil society 9. More evidence of corruption can, perversely, be an indication of success: systems working better detect more of it. 10. Projects must be prepared to respond swiftly and repeatedly to opportunities as they arise. This principle is successfully utilised by TIB in their work to reduce corruption in public service institutions, such as hospitals and schools. Community watchdogs monitor the institutions after a TIB intervention. If improvements are not sustained, TIB will intervene repeatedly until the reforms are sustained. Entry points for intervention need to be chosen carefully. 11. Development partners need to focus on prevention of corruption by continuing their support to civil society: to strengthen, meet and make visible the population's desire to end corruption. The desire for change needs to come from citizens. civil society is a significant driver of change in Bangladesh. 12. Experience with TIB also shows the importance of pressure from civil society. Pressure from civil society can curb government action or force the government's arm. For example pressure from civil society forced the government's arm in setting up the Human Rights Commission and entrenching the powers of the Comission more firmly than those of the ACC under the ACC Act. 13. The lack of results in governance reforms can be blamed on both sides. The lack of continuity, coupled with the lack of high quality technical advisory support, means that donor-funded projects in public sector reforms do not get enough buy-in. At the same time, GoB knows how to manipulate donors and play one against one another. They know donors' own dynamics, namely that they have to spend a certain amount of money to meet their annual spending targets. 14. Check and balance institutions will be as effective as the GoB wants them to be. As donors continued to support institutions, GoB has shown strong resistance to revising essential laws, including in tax, police and parliament. In addition, successive governments have tampered Acts regulating the mandate of key institutions and with it, continue to interfere and curtail their independence.

The last point encourages farmers to maintain or increase the cultivated area , despite low rice prices , and to reduce agrochemical use .	Environmental concerns require reduced agrochemical use and alternatives to forest clearing for crop production. To achieve these objectives, rice scientists must continue working on (1) developing higher-yielding wetland rice varieties, (2) developing more productive varieties for upland rice, and (3) reducing production costs and environmental hazards through genetically resistant varieties and better crop management practices to achieve higher efficiency in the use of inputs.

China is by far the largest T&T economy in Asia-Pacific and the 13th most competitive globally (up two spots from 2017). It welcomes more international visitors than any other country in the region and its T&T industry benefits from a large and growing domestic market. The cornerstone of China's competitiveness is its exceptional natural resources (4th) as well as the TTCI's highest score for cultural resources. The nation has the greatest number of UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites in the world as well as impressive wildlife (6th). It also ranks first on intangible heritage and cultural and entertainment digital demand, second for sports stadiums and eight for business events. Fairly low hotel prices (25th) and reduced ticket taxes (58th to 35th) help minimize the cost of staying and traveling within and to China. Moreover, travel is facilitated by an extensive list of air carriers (7th) that have produced the second-largest airline capacity in the world. Intra-country travel is also made easier by one of the world longest railway networks, which gets relatively positive marks for quality (17th) and efficiency (25th).

This is most likely linked to the high degree of Coted'Ivoire's urbanization and urban concentration with most firms and nonagricultural wage employment confined to Abidjan. Fifty-three percent of the population is urban, of which 40 percent lives in Abidjan (Figure2.11). In 2012, less than 10 percent of formal jobs were outside Abidjan (Figure5.10), with the vast majority of new formal jobs continuing to be generated in Abidjan (Figure5.16), and only very few in other urban areas (mainly in agribusiness). This urbanization pattern comes along with a high wage premium for skilled labor (laborers with higher education) who tend to earn on average about as much in other urban areas as in Abidjan, and about three times more than unskilled laborers in these urban areas (the highest locational skill premium) (Table 2.1). The low difference in wages for highly skilled workers between Abidjan and other urban areas suggests that a wage premium is needed to attract skilled labor to other urban areas (possibly also because of underdeveloped public services in these areas).

Today , more than one-tenth of 15-to-24-year-olds worldwide are functionally illiterate , and that does not bode well for their future.107 Also , social skills assume an ever more important role as complements to basic cognitive skills .	But jobs may neither pull nor build skills to a significant degree, even if the foundational cognitive skills are in place. This occurs in situations where the benefits from agglomeration and global integration are present but not adequately exploited. Countries undergoing rapid urbanization often have sizable knowledge spillovers to reap but may fail to move up the value-added ladder. If so, they can be caught in traps of low productivity and low skills.110 Such traps arise when skills are insufficient to spur innovation and the demand for skills is too low to encourage their acquisition. In those cases, more relevant schooling and skill building at the secondary, technical, and likely higher levels are needed as a prerequisite for the creation of good jobs for development. tation and can have cascading ripple effects.104 In Singapore, India's Tata group was the first international company to partner with the Economic Development Board in 1972 to establish a company-owned training center for precision engineers. This partnership model was successfully replicated in subsequent years with other foreign companies, eventually leading to the consolidation of various institutions in 1993 to form Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic. Today, the polytechnic has become a source of international expertise on industry-led training.105 Intel's decision to establish its semiconductor assembly and test plant in Costa Rica has equally contributed significantly to that country's prospects and skill building system.106 Jobs need skills, pull skills, and build skills Some skills are necessary for productive employment to emerge in the first place. And they cannot be acquired on the job. Without numeracy and literacy skills, the prospects of improving employment opportunities and earnings, whether in agriculture or in urban settings, are thin. Today, more than one-tenth of 15-to-24-year-olds worldwide are functionally illiterate, and that does not bode well for their future.107 Also, social skills assume an ever more important role as complements to basic cognitive skills. Given that skill building is cumulative, securing the foundation on which much of the later path of skill acquisition follows remains an absolute priority. Many countries are not there yet.

Poverty and other barriers further reinforce gender disparities in learning opportunities The reasons why children do not attend school vary, but they are often associated with poverty, ethnicity, social exclusion, living in a rural area or slum, geographic remoteness, disasters, armed conflict, lack of basic facilities and poor-quality education. These barriers often interact with gender to create even greater disadvantages in learning opportunities. Countries face different challenges and need different policies depending on their circumstances. Among interventions that have successfully been used to reach the disadvantaged and the marginalized, especially girls include: the abolishment of school fees; increased education budgets; social cash transfers, especially to support poor families, making it easier for them to send their children to school; increasing attention to ethnic and linguistic minorities; overcoming conflicts that keep children out of school because of hostilities; and improving the quality of education.15 School progression at the primary level In order to achieve universal completion of primary education, it is important that all boys and girls of primary school age attend school and progress through primary education. High levels of repetition and drop out hinder a considerable number of children from transitioning to secondary education. Difficulty in progressing through the primary grades (repeating) or leaving school before completing the last grade of primary education (dropping out) occur for a variety of reasons, mostly related to the educational system and social and economic factors. Gender plays a significant role in school progression and completion in most countries. 15 UNESCO, 2014a.

The explanation is supported by analyzing how firms are most likely to be organized across different size categories (see Caliendo, Monte, and RossiHansberg 2015, for an explanation on how firms organize to economize on their use of knowledge). Among those with at least 20 employees, the vast majority of firms are organized in a more complex structure that includes all four types of employees (unskilled laborers, technicians, middle management, and senior executives). In contrast, only 16.6 percent of micro firms have all four layers of employees while the vast majority only have one or two types of workers. As average wages are significantly higher for the upper more-skilled layers, these differences in firms' organizational structure can account for their wage differentials.

Most food sold in Brunei must be certified as halal. However, there is a small market for non-halal foods, which must be sold in designated rooms in grocery stores separated from other products or at restaurants that are specified as non-halal. The Ministry of Religious Affairs administers Brunei's halal standards, which are among the most stringent in the world. Regulations enacted in May 2017 require all businesses that produce, supply, and serve food and beverages to obtain a halal certificate. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed. However, under Brunei's Halal Meat Act, halal meat (including beef, mutton, lamb, and chicken) can be imported only by a person holding a halal import permit and an export permit from the exporting country. Additionally, the importers and local suppliers of halal meat must be Muslim. The Bruneian government maintains a list of the foreign and local slaughtering centers (abattoirs) that have been inspected and declared fit for supplying meat that can be certified as halal. Brunei's stringent system of abattoir approval involves on-site inspections carried out by Bruneian government officials for every establishment seeking to export meat or poultry to Brunei. Halal meat must be kept separately from non-halal meat at all times, and halal certification must be renewed annually by the Brunei Religious Council.	The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed.

Rethinking international migration , internal migration , mobility and urbanization That migration is the most problematic of the population variables is taken as given .	Rethinking international migration, internal migration, mobility and urbanization That migration is the most problematic of the population variables is taken as given. Unlike the unique events of birth and death that define an individual's lifetime, migration can be a multiple event. Its measurement depends entirely upon how it is defined in time and across space. ... Despite all the problems inherent in the collection of migration data, significant progress has been achieved over recent years. The compilation of a world origin-destination database, developed originally at the University of Sussex and now much extended and maintained by the United Nations Population Division and the World Bank, has provided the framework for a more precise measurement of global international population movement.a These data showed that about 3 per cent of the world's population lived in a State or territory not of their birth and that that proportion had not changed significantly since the 1990s ... As the systems of internal and international migration evolve and change, so too, does the nature of the linkages between them ... other forms of short-term mobility emerge from essentially urban cultures and economies. ... The idea that most people do not move or are fixed at a specific location might be appealing but it is wrong. Mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility. Nevertheless, some peoples appear to move more than others and in different ways from others, which appears to be closely linked with the level of development in each country, which, in turn, is linked with the distribution of the population in each country. Despite all the difficulties with the measurement of internal migration as sketched above, considerable progress has been made towards the construction of analytical models that allow the comparison of patterns across space.

Improved rice gene pools The objective of this work is to increase rice genetic diversity and enhance gene pools for higher and more stable yields. This research has five steps: 1. Improved germplasm, which involves identifying progenitors for crossing, evaluating segregating material, and carrying out yield trials. 2. Improved populations (recurrent selection), requiring evaluation/ recombination of gene pools, development of blast resistance through recurrent selection, development of indica gene pools with a higher response to anther culture, enhanced pest and disease resistance, high yield potential, and excellent quality. 3. Identification and use of genes from wild germplasm. First, useful wild germplasm and its traits are identified, followed by International rice research and development 57 interspecific crosses and the development of backcross populations. These populations undergo quantitative trait loci analysis and suitable isogenic lines are produced for release as advanced lines. Anther culture is used to speed up the process. 4. Determination of the physiological basis for yield enhancement and adaptation to abiotic stresses. These traits are characterized from wild rice and nutrient uptake is investigated under low pH and high Al conditions. 5. Developing marker-aided selection, part of a long-term strategy to give rice breeders another tool, allowing them to incorporate even more traits into enhanced gene pools.

Robust public institutions that are transparent and accountable can help minimize corrupting efforts of drug trafficking organizations .	16. Addressing social, economic and political issues that can create opportunities for violence and drug use may be as valuable as the efforts directly targeting the drugs themselves. As the Board has noted in the past, both the supply and demand sides of the drug problem are affected by socioeconomic factors such as poverty, hunger, economic inequality, social exclusion, deprivation, migration and displacement, limited access to education and employment prospects, and exposure to violence and abuse. Those factors are important drivers of the drug problem and need to be taken into consideration as part of a comprehensive approach. When designing and implementing policies to assist people living with substance abuse disorders, States must look deeper at socioeconomic factors such as poverty, marginalization, gender and child development. The role and responsibility of families and society in protecting children by creating environments that are conducive to prevention of drug abuse cannot be overemphasized. 17. The drug problem has many contributing factors and can be influenced by policies in other areas not aimed specifically at illicit drug supply and use. For example, policies that strengthen resiliency at the individual, family and community levels can reduce vulnerability to drug abuse and enhance the prospects for the speedy and lasting recovery of those who have developed drug abuse problems. Robust public institutions that are transparent and accountable can help minimize corrupting efforts of drug trafficking organizations. Likewise, strong communities with rich economic potential are more likely to withstand the deleterious impact of illicit drug crop cultivation and the corrupting influence of drug dealing and drug trafficking.

For the varietal component , a focus will be placed on community-based seed supply systems to address weak seed multiplication systems for farmers of rainfed rice .	Given the need to stabilize the rainfed upland environment and the success of the NERICAs, WARDA implements its research strategy for this environment along the following four lines: * Increased use of NERICA seed in farmers' fields. PVS work in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire has shown the potential of NERICAs in farmers' fields. In the coming decade, WARDA will expand the number of farmers exposed to NERICAs throughout the region through PVS. * The development of new inter-and intraspecific rice cultivars. WARDA will enlarge the gene pool for uplands using advanced and more traditional breeding tools. In addition, participatory plant breeding will provide farmer input into WARDA's breeding program and speed up the identification of favorable plant material with resistance to drought and soil acidity. * Validation and dissemination of integrated natural resource management (INRM) practices. INRM practices ensure preservation of the natural resource base and/or sustainable intensification. Building on previous achievements in the development of N-fixing fallow legumes and the introduction of a modest use of fertilizer, including rock-phosphate, emphasis will be placed on integrated biophysical and socioeconomic assessment of these technologies and the formulation of adequate baskets of technologies. * Creating an enabling environment for the scaling-up of NERICAs and INRM practices. For the varietal component, a focus will be placed on community-based seed supply systems to address weak seed multiplication systems for farmers of rainfed rice. For INRM, the focus will be on strengthening the capabilities of rice development stakeholders in applying research results.

Farmers use an area for 1-3 yr until soil fertility declines and weed and pest infestations increase .	Depending on the size of their farms and their resources, upland rice farmers use farming systems ranging from shifting to permanent cultivation. Shifting cultivation is common in Indonesia, Lao PDR, northern Thailand, and Vietnam in Asia, and in the forested areas of Latin America and West Africa. Farmers plant a rice crop alone or in association with other crops such as maize, yam, beans, cassava, or plantains. In many places, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Southwest China, and Brazil, upland rice may be intercropped with maize. In areas with sufficient rainfall, upland rice may be followed by a crop of maize, cowpea, beans, soybean, or sweet potato. In West Africa, one or more crops may be mixed with upland rice. Farmers use an area for 1-3 yr until soil fertility declines and weed and pest infestations increase. They then abandon the land and return to previously abandoned farmland or start cropping on other available fallow land. In traditional shifting cultivation systems, fallow periods were as long as 30 years. This lengthy fallow restored fertility and prevented weed seed buildup. Now, rotations in most upland areas practicing shifting cultivation have shortened to a 2-or 3-yr cycle because of increased population pressure. This has resulted in increased weed pressure and reduced soil fertility.	Farmers use an area for 1-3 yr until soil fertility declines and weed and pest infestations increase.

Telecommunications , health , and energy sectors also appear to be particularly problematic , as do real estate transactions ( particularly land title transfers ) .	The Honduran government has undertaken several measures in an effort to address corruption, including pursuing indictments against current and former government officials; partnering with the Organization of American States, beginning in 2016, to create the independent Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH); signing international transparency initiatives, such as the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative; and dedicating resources to bolster existing commitments under initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership and the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. The CAFTA-DR also contains strong public sector antibribery commitments and anti-corruption measures in government contracting and U.S. firms are guaranteed a fair and transparent process to sell goods and services to a wide range of government entities. Despite these efforts and bilateral commitments, U.S. firms and citizens continue to report corruption in the government, including in the judiciary, to be a significant concern and a constraint to successful investment in Honduras. These reports suggest that corruption is pervasive in government procurement, the issuance of government permits, and the regulatory system in general.

This is because the determinants of health are an integral part of many other goals. A person's state of health is determined by features of the social environment - poverty (Goal 1), hunger (Goal 2), education (Goal 4), work (Goal 8), gender (Goal 5), economic inequality (Goal 10) and peace (Goal 16) - and the physical environment - clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), energy (Goal 7) and climate (Goal 13).

Transnational criminal organizations and their affiliates are likely to expand their influence over some weak states, collaborate with US adversaries, and possibly threaten critical infrastructure.  Mexican criminals use bribery, intimidation, and violence to protect their drug trafficking, kidnapping-for-ransom, fuel-theft, gunrunning, extortion, and alien-smuggling enterprises.  Gangs based in Central America, such as MS-13, continue to direct some criminal activities beyond the region, including in the United States. Transnational organized crime almost certainly will continue to inflict human suffering, deplete natural resources, degrade fragile ecosystems, drive migration, and drain income from the productive--and taxable--economy.

Despite dire predictions at that time, most Asian countries have done remarkably well so far in meeting food needs of their growing population. But this is primarily because those concerns regarding the food shortages mobilized financial and scientific resources for research on food grains, which has succeeded in increasing the productivity of limited land resources. Over the last three decades, the Asian population has increased by nearly 80% but rice production has doubled (Table 1), contributing to substantial increases in individual consumption of rice and calorie intake.

Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries .	"The transfer of foods between the Old and New Worlds during the Columbian Exchange had important consequences for world history. Historian Alfred Crosby (1989, p. 666) describes the significance of the transfer of food crops between the continents, writing: ""The coming together of the continents was a prerequisite for the population explosion of the past two centuries, and certainly played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. The transfer across the ocean of the staple food crops of the Old and New Worlds made possible the former."" There are two channels through which the Columbian Exchange expanded the global supply of agricultural goods. First, it introduced previously unknown species to the Old World. Many of these species--like potatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, and cassava (also known as manioc)--resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples. Other crops such as tomatoes, cacao, and chili peppers were not by themselves especially rich in calories, but complemented existing foods by increasing vitamin intake and improving taste. In many instances, the New World foods had an important effect on the evolution of local cuisines. Chili peppers gave rise to spicy curries in India, to paprika in Hungary, and to spicy kimchee in Korea. Tomatoes significantly altered the cuisine of Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Second, the discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with vast quantities of relatively unpopulated land well-suited for the cultivation of certain crops that were in high demand in Old World markets. Crops such as sugar, coffee, soybeans, oranges, and bananas were all introduced to the New World, and the Americas quickly became the main suppliers of these crops globally."

The extent to which foods indigenous to the New World today comprise an important portion of the world's diet is illustrated by Table 1, which reports the world's most popular foods in 2000. Thefirst list reports foods with popularity measured by the average consumption of calories per person per day. Because this measure may overstate the popularity of high-calorie food crops, we also provide rankings based on production and land under cultivation. These are reported in the second and third lists. Foods that are indigenous to the New World are reported in bold text. From the table it is clear that today New World foods are an important part of our diets.

There are reinforcing links between contextual factors such as limited access to land and government support , that serves to undermine rice farming and keep farmers in a vulnerable state .	Formal institutional support from the local government does not align with the needs, capacities, or context of small-scale rice farmers. There are reinforcing links between contextual factors such as limited access to land and government support, that serves to undermine rice farming and keep farmers in a vulnerable state. This is illustrated by sharecroppers who reported difficulties in accessing loans and government schemes to support agriculture without a certificate of land ownership (a patta). In contrast to sharecroppers, farmers who owned land were more likely to fund cultivation via formal credit (co-operatives) while also having a higher probability of not using money lenders (informal) or daily wage laboring (p < 0.05; Table 7). This was despite agricultural credit from the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) being available to sharecroppers (Ministry of Agriculture 2014c). The qualitative interviews emphasized the marginalization of small-scale famers from formal institutional support. This meant a large proportion of sharecroppers were not aware of the insurance components available within the KCC, which would otherwise be an ex-post means of coping with production shocks.

Ending privilege, more than improving labor market matching or upgrading skills, is thus the priority for countries with high youth unemployment. Dynamism in more skills-intensive sectors would lead to faster growth by putting educated youth to work. It Formalizing economies The challenge of formalization is present in economies where a large share of the labor force is already covered by labor legislation and social protection programs, and reaching universal coverage seems attainable. But going in that direction raises serious tradeoffs. Formalization is often seen as necessary to strengthen social cohesion. It is also bound to increase the living standards of those who get under the purview of labor law and gain access to social protection. But formalization may reduce productivity if it distorts incentives or puts a burden on firms.	Formalization is often seen as necessary to strengthen social cohesion.

Furthermore, differences among countries represent only a fraction of the overall variation in student performance. In all three subjects tested--reading, mathematics and science--the differences between the lowest-and the highest-performing students within the countries were large and the inequality in learning achievement across population groups was closely related to wealth distribution. Gender differences in educational performance were considerably less prominent than differences between the countries and within countries in educational performance.b Nevertheless, existing gaps underscore the importance of a gender-sensitive approach in teaching.

In other cases, indigenous peoples and local communities are co-inhabiting and co-managing areas, and in yet further cases indigenous peoples use the term ""community conserved areas"" for practical reasons, for example when the term ""indigenous"" is not recognised. Similar regional differences exist regarding the term ""territory"". Amongst both indigenous peoples and local communities there are cases where the term ""conserved area"" is used and others where ""protected area"" is preferred: 3. Governance we use a range of terms herein. Below we summarise the concepts and include a description of indigenous peoples' territories and protected areas."

Knowledge spillovers underlie the agglomeration effects observed in cities and in production clusters.101 But knowledge spillovers from jobs also occur in rural areas. During the Green Revolution in India, farmers with experienced neighbors made larger profits than those with inexperienced ones.102 Benefits from social learning at the village level were substantial.103 Jobs can also ignite skills building by putting people in contact with the outside world.

Given such high institutional requirements, attempts to transplant the dual model in its entirety have seen little success.

"International trade, travel, tourism, and transport - The 4 Ts - are the major drivers of biological invasion (McNeely et al., 2001). Every country contributes to the problem: some request goods and services from afar, while others supply products to meet these demands. ""More Faster Further"" have become the slogans of economic growth. In 2001, world import and export markets were valued at US$6270 billion and US$6155 billion, respectively (World Trade Organization, 2002). People also increasingly travel the world for business and pleasure. Commercial services (including travel, transport, and other services) totalled US$1443 billion in imports and US$1458 billion in exports worldwide in 2001 (World Trade Organization, 2002). Despite good intentions, developed countries occasionally facilitate the introduction of IAS to other countries through development assistance programs, military operations, famine relief projects, and international financing (McNeely et al., 2001, Reaser et al., 2003). Land-use and climate change can also facilitate invasion by making habitats more challenging for native species and more hospitable to IAS (Mooney & Hobbs, 2001).

This report presents exploratory research on an understudied area that can be used to develop robust research questions and hypotheses in the future .	The research is guided by four main questions: 1. Impact: What does the existing literature suggest about the impact of women's leadership on the humanitarian sector and humanitarian assistance, specifically in locally led humanitarian action? Particular attention was paid to documenting the effectiveness of women's leadership in humanitarian action by looking at the results of efforts made by local humanitarian actors to support gender-transformative action. Definitions of women's leadership and gender-transformative action are to follow. 2. Current Engagement: How are women and women's organizations involved in the humanitarian sector and in situations of locally led humanitarian action? 3. Barriers and Challenges: What barriers and challenges do women and women's organizations face in their participation in the humanitarian sector, and specifically in LHL? In what ways does LHL constrain, if at all, women's leadership? 4. Opportunities: Does LHL encourage women's leadership? How does this compare across the country case studies? 10 Exploring Women's Leadership in Humanitarian Action in Bangladesh and South Sudan a. Are there opportunities for advancing women's leadership in locally led humanitarian action? If so, under what conditions? b. What enables women and women's organizations to successfully engage in the humanitarian sector and locally led humanitarian action? These questions test the extent to which women's leadership features in locally led humanitarian action, and the extent to which it needs to feature to ensure a truly transformed humanitarian system and effective response. The findings from these questions go toward the body of evidence on LHL, and specifically turn a feminist lens on LHL. The findings also help identify how women's leadership can be better incorporated into efforts to alleviate a consistent problem: the patriarchal humanitarian system's inadequate response to women's gender-based needs and disregard for women's agency.

"India is arguably an example of a country whose complex and cumbersome labor policies have pushed it offthe ""plateau."" The country has more than 40 national and state-level labor laws. Most of them apply to the organized (or formal) sector and to firms above a certain size. As firms' employment increases, they fall under the purview of a growing number of regulations.121 The Industrial Disputes Act (Ida) of 1947 is particularly restrictive. Governing employee-employer relationships, the IDA makes it extremely difficult for firms to terminate employment.122 The stringency of labor regulations is consistent with the ""missing middle"" phenomenon, characteristic of India and other developing countries, where medium-size businesses make up a disproportionately small share of the total. Also consistent with the stringency of labor regulations is the substantial dispersion of productivity.

For example , the activity of insulating an existing house has a Footprint for production and installation of the insulation materials .	"Footprint intensity: The number of global hectares required to produce a given quantity of resource or absorb a given quantity of waste, usually expressed as global hectares per tonne. The National Footprint Accounts calculate a primary Footprint Intensity Table for each country, which includes the global hectares of primary land use type needed to produce or absorb a tonne of product (i.e., global hectares of cropland per tonne of wheat, global hectares of forest per tonne carbon dioxide)."" Footprint Intensity Table: A collection of the primary and secondary product Footprint intensities from the National Footprint Accounts. Footprint intensity is usually measured in gha per tonne of product or waste (CO2). The Footprint Intensity Table is maintained by Global Footprint Network, supported by the Network's National Accounts Committee. Footprint-neutral or negative: Human activities or services that result in no increase or a net reduction in humanity's Ecological Footprint. For example, the activity of insulating an existing house has a Footprint for production and installation of the insulation materials. This insulation in turn reduces the energy needed for cooling and heating this existing house. If the Footprint reduction from this energy cutback is equal to or greater than the original Footprint of insulating the house, the latter becomes a Footprint-neutral or negative activity. On the other hand, making a new house highly energy efficient does not by itself make the house Footprint-neutral, unless it at the same time causes a reduction in other existing Footprints. This Footprint reduction has to be larger than the Footprint of building and operating the new house."

Indeed , it is now recognised that in many apparently natural ecosystems , indigenous people have influenced species composition over long periods of time .	In other cases keys and decision trees have been developed. Dichotomous keys are a familiar tool for conservationists and are used primarily in plant or animal identification. They usually consist of a series of questions, each with a choice between two or more characteristics, and are applied in a process of elimination to identify the characteristics that do/do not apply to a particular species. Although not always nearly so easy to use as this definition implies, the development of keys, matrices and decision trees to help identify whether an area meets the definition of a protected area and which of the categories it fits best has been a common element of many of the category assignment projects around the world. There are, however, a number of challenges in using such an approach. In particular, the categories are not hierarchical; they are based on a particular set of management priorities for each category and the individual circumstances under which the categories are assigned can differ between country, biome, region, etc., all of which can make the formulation of a simple dichotomy between one characteristic of category and another very difficult. For example, decision trees do not easily accommodate those protected areas where indigenous peoples rely on protected areas for subsistence. Category II protected areas, for example, are managed to ensure their 'ecological functions and native species composition are relatively intact' (2008 Guidelines, page 16). This means they 'will not generally have resource use permitted ...' (page 17). However, it is also acknowledged that, where appropriate, a management objective of category II protected areas should also be to 'take into account the needs of indigenous people and local communities, including subsistence resource use, in so far as these will not adversely affect the primary management objective' (2008 Guidelines, page 16). Indeed, it is now recognised that in many apparently natural ecosystems, indigenous people have influenced species composition over long periods of time. Defining a category II protected area on the basis of no natural resource use therefore will not work in many cases as management decisions are more nuanced.

Ensuring access to skills upgrading opportunities for youths and adults who already exited the education system is challenging, particularly because so many have low educational attainment and limited skills to start with. For this subgroup, the role for public intervention is not necessarily confined to the direct provision of training. Facilitation of access and incentivizing of quality improvements in existing private training opportunities can be considered as well. For instance, traditional apprenticeship is one of the most prevalent source of training opportunities. Rather than replacing these traditional apprenticeships and attempting to set up a parallel publicly managed system, existing private informal apprenticeship arrangements could be leveraged. For example, the setup of certification frameworks allowing apprentices to take exams and become certified could be linked to financial incentives for trainers whose apprentices succeed at these exams. The setup of such an approach is not without challenges, but it would allow building on the widespread private apprenticeship system rather than attempting to replace it.

Enhancing rice farming resilience to climate hazards is an important objective. The challenge is amplified by the magnitude of climate hazard exposure in deltas, and the concentrations of poor households who practice rice cultivation in deltas. It is likely that climate change will increase the intensity and occurrence of climate hazards (Mathison et al. 2013). Without understanding how to build the resilience of rice farming in deltas, it is difficult to create effective long-term management plans for agricultural development, and to assess the consequences of future climate change on rice production, and on farmer livelihoods. Here, to address this issue, we use primary field data from the Mahanadi Delta in India to assess what factors explain rice farmer resilience to climate hazards. 1uwa School of Agriculture and Environment, University of Western Australia, 2Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, UK, 3Geography and Environment, University of Southampton, UK., 4Wageningen School of Social Sciences (Wass), Wageningen University and Research Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ in the Mahanadi Delta the majority of farmers are smallholders excluded from local Economic Growth (Ministry of Agriculture 2014a).

Rice farming in Odisha is pursued on its own, or as part of a mix of livelihood strategies under a range of owned land and share cropping arrangements. This context enables assessment of how climate hazards interact with different rice farming livelihood strategies to determine resilience.

Objectives and scope of the guideline The overall goal of this guideline is to assist national governments and national and international partners to improve the design , implementation , performance and evaluation of CHW programmes , contributing to the progressive realization of universal health coverage .	The largest beneficiary group of this guideline, beyond CHWs themselves, are the individuals and communities living in these contexts, who often lack equitable access to primary health care and other services and consequently lag behind in terms of health service coverage and health outcomes, as well as development outcomes more broadly. The guideline, therefore, has a potential to contribute to the reduction of inequities among these populations by strengthening the competencies, motivation, performance and management of CHWs and enhancing programme sustainability, which in turn can improve effective coverage of essential health interventions.

Infrastructure and planning decisions will shape the way residents live for years to come ; the Footprint can help decision-makers balance the needs of citizens with a growing concern about the city 's use of natural resources .	Part 2 Ecological accounting under the glass dome. Only sunlight has access to the futuristic city. With the sunshine a certain amount of energy enters - which is all there is to power the city. Though hypothetical, this approach somewhat reflects that of the Footprint. How large must the glass dome be - how much farm land, how many forests and other areas must it encompass for the city to be viable? Of course one can't simply imagine each city in isolation. The areas from which urban centers import their resources are distributed across large parts of the world, and, in times of globalization, cities compete for the global supply of natural capital. A city which provides a comparable quality of life with a smaller per capita Footprint is also less dependent upon imports, and therefore more competitive. If today the majority of people live in cities, then that is exactly where the future of civilization will be decided. The Footprint helps in adjusting infrastructure and urban planning for the future. Take traffic for example. As complex as discussions are about transportation and infrastructure, the Footprint can reduce the information to a single number each time: the required area. This is crucial when making investment decisions, be it for building roads, tracks, bridges, harbors or entire settlements. Infrastructure and planning decisions will shape the way residents live for years to come; the Footprint can help decision-makers balance the needs of citizens with a growing concern about the city's use of natural resources.

These variables deal with trade creation and diversion for insiders 32 | OECD BUSINESS AND FINANCE OUTLOOK 2018 ( c ) OECD 2018 versus outsiders .	It uses a full complement of variables, including: relative size (the similarity index based on GDP); bilateral exchange rates; relative factor endowments; presence of a common language; investment openness (infrastructure investment builds connectivity and investing in distribution and joint ventures helps exports); physical distance between the trade partners; presence of common borders; presence of political instability; and whether the partner was a former colony. The gravity model works well, though a few variables are not well-supported by the data (mainly in the case of BRI export origin economies). The reason for developing this model is to explore where linkages are strongest and weakest and where the most advantages might be obtained via connectivity improvements. There are two types of influences tested simultaneously:  One set of dummy variables (RTA_I and RTA_O in Annex A) allow precisely for each bilateral pair to be a member of the same bloc, or one is a member and the other is not. These variables deal with trade creation and diversion for insiders 32 | OECD BUSINESS AND FINANCE OUTLOOK 2018 (c) OECD 2018 versus outsiders. Presumably if two countries belong to the same bloc then more trade should be created (a positive coefficient is expected) (see Ekanayake et al., 2010). If one country belongs to a regional trade agreement and the other does not, trade might be diverted between the two, offsetting the gains from trade creation, so the expected sign on the coefficient is negative.  Having allowed for trade creation and diversion, the regional dummy variables for explicit trading blocs (like NAFTA, ASEAN+1, and the Bangkok Agreement) should be interpreted as the extra-bloc exports and imports effect. The idea is that being a member of a group might create synergies in supply chains and income effects that are positive for exports and imports versus non-members.

While the urban population can be reached through traditional and social media , in rural Sierra Leone information also flows through traditional leaders .	In Sierra Leone, one way that the government builds awareness at the national level is through radio, for which the Ministry of Health and Sanitation has developed several broadcasts in 13 local languages, with local leaders disseminating information on the virus. While the urban population can be reached through traditional and social media, in rural Sierra Leone information also flows through traditional leaders. Their involvement was key during the Ebola response and the same course of action has been taken this time. Students attending radio lessons received regular reminders on COVID-19 as part of their scheduled lessons. As recent cases have emerged in informal settlements, some local leaders have initiated their own COVID-19 sensitisation training, joined by medical practitioners, social workers, the police. Results from a survey conducted in the Freetown area on the effectiveness of the above interventions indicated that over 95% of respondents had heard of COVID-19, with 90.3% being able to correctly identify at least one symptom; however, 41% of respondents believe that COVID-19 is man-made. (Grieco et al, 2020) Despite the government's efforts to provide accessible, accurate information, disinformation is commonly circulated through social media. The official response to counter these rumours has been slow. The communication department of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation is planning to use a mechanism successfully deployed during the Ebola outbreak, when a bulletin is published daily listing, and correcting, fake news. Implementation is, however, still pending. (c) Maintains 99 In Uganda, traditional media are used to create awareness, provide updates, and effect appropriate risk communication. Health messages are further enforced by mass text messages sent by telecommunications providers to their mobile clients. The government insists that all messages and community engagements are channelled through the MoH to ensure that messages are standard and uniform in nature. Misinformation appearing especially on social media is corrected through official social media channels on Twitter and Facebook. (C) maintains 100 .

The centrality of jobs for development should not be interpreted as the centrality of labor policies and institutions. Nearly half the people at work in developing countries are farmers or self-employed and so are outside the labor market. And even in the case of wage employment, labor policies and institutions may or may not be the main obstacle to job creation. Often, the most relevant obstacles lie outside of the labor market. The catalysts for job creation may be policies that make cities work better, help farmers access and apply appropriate agricultural techniques, or allow firms to develop new exports.

In the city of Rio de Janeiro , a spike in violence saw a surge in unlawful killings by the police , with soaring rates of killings and other human rights violations elsewhere in the country .	Authorities in Brazil ignored a deepening human rights crisis of their own making. In the city of Rio de Janeiro, a spike in violence saw a surge in unlawful killings by the police, with soaring rates of killings and other human rights violations elsewhere in the country. Little was done to reduce the number of homicides, to control the use of force by the police or to guarantee Indigenous Peoples' rights. The chaotic, overcrowded and dangerous state of Brazil's prisons resulted in more than 120 deaths of inmates during riots reported in January. Despite the homicide rate falling in Honduras, there were serious concerns about high levels of violence and insecurity; prevalent impunity undermined public trust in the authorities and the justice system. Massive protests took place throughout the country - denouncing the lack of transparency around the presidential election held in November - and were violently repressed by security forces, leading to at least 31people being killed, dozens arbitrarily detained and others injured. Dozens of unlawful killings by the security forces were reported in the Dominican Republic, which endured a persistently high homicide rate. Jamaica's police continued to commit unlawful killings - some potentially amounting to extrajudicial executions - with impunity. 30 Amnesty International report 2017/18 .

These crops include pulses , oilseeds , spices , potato , onion , garlic , wheat , and barley .	In Bangladesh, deepwater rice farmers have traditionally grown a wide range of crops after the floods by seeding or planting onto the straw of the deepwater rice crop. These crops include pulses, oilseeds, spices, potato, onion, garlic, wheat, and barley. Postflood and dry-season cropping are now widely practiced in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Preflood cropping, although not widespread, includes mungbean, sesame, chili, and sorghum. These crops, if successful, are harvested before the main floods arrive. Sometimes jute or maize is planted along with deepwater rice or just before the deepwater rice crop is sown. In India, farmers in many deepwater rice areas have recently incorporated grain legumes (mainly mungbean), sesame, maize, and sorghum into their rotation. They grow these crops as a mixture with deepwater rice on stored soil water at the start of the wet season.	These crops include pulses, oilseeds, spices, potato, onion, garlic, wheat, and barley.

In recent years , for example , we have witnessed the use of ICT by migrants to gather information and advice in real time during migration journeys ; an issue that is raising interest and , at times , concern .	"Migration is intertwined with technology and innovation and there exists a large body of analysis that has assessed how international migration acts to support (and sometimes limit) the transfer of technology and knowledge, often working in tandem with investment and trade flows along historical, geographic and geopolitical connections between countries and communities.24 Technology is increasingly critical throughout the migration process, especially newer forms of technology. In recent years, for example, we have witnessed the use of ICT by migrants to gather information and advice in real time during migration journeys; an issue that is raising interest and, at times, concern. The use of ICT, such as apps to share the latest information, including to support clandestine border crossings, together with the consolidation of social media platforms to connect geographically dispersed groups with common interests, has raised valid questions concerning the extent to which technology has been used to support irregular migration, as well as to enable migrants to avoid abusive and exploitative migrant smugglers and human traffickers.25 Due to the ever-increasing access to emerging technology at low cost, migrants have also developed applications to support better integration in receiving countries, while maintaining social links and financial support to their families and societies back home, including through the increasing prevalence of ""mobile money"" apps."

Specific: Peanut CRSP to maintain initiatives in the Philippines. In the next program phase, the successful initiatives in the Philippines have to be maintained, especially those involving the private sector food industry and the emerging work involving micro-and small-scale food enterprises in the rural areas. The focus should be on monitoring and evaluation of changes as the food industry builds on the significant achievements to push for an increased share in the peanutbased products market. Strengthen linkages with extension service providers for wider public dissemination of information and to strengthen linkage of markets (traders/processors) with peanut producers (farmers). U.S. scientists should continue to provide technical guidance to Philippine research institutions on new technologies and research methodologies. The strong research network that was established with UGA scientists, through the project, needs to be maintained. General: Peanut CRSP to promote the Industry Incubator Model to transfer processing and post-harvest technologies to other regions where Peanut CRSP has intensively worked (i.e., West Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe). This would necessitate a strong technology transfer component of the ongoing/new projects that should include training of key stakeholders. In some cases, a new institutional arrangement would be needed with new partners besides the current collaborating research institution to enlist support from a food science group.

In Kenya, usage rates for essential routine medical services have been severely affected, even at this comparatively early stage of the outbreak. For example, in March 2020 immunisation, family planning, and HIV prevention and treatment services were down to 30 to 35% of their normal levels, while in-hospital delivery rates are reportedly down by over 50% (Global Citizen, 2020). Perceived reasons for reduced use of health facility services include community fear of facility-acquired infection, curfew and movement restrictions, and fear of police harassment. The supply of routine services has been limited by concern among health workers providing non-COVID-19 services about lack of protection, given that PPE is being prioritised for COVID-19 activities. Strategic decisions and prioritisation have also limited supply, including efforts to decongest facilities by seeing patients by appointment only, or solely for critical cases, suspension of all elective procedures by the MoH, and reallocation of healthcare staff from essential routine care to COVID-19. The MoH also released guidelines for health workers on how to continue providing quality preventive and clinical services in light of the COVID-19 pandemic (MoH Kenya, 2020c).	For example, in March 2020 immunisation, family planning, and HIV prevention and treatment services were down to 30 to 35% of their normal levels, while in-hospital delivery rates are reportedly down by over 50% (Global Citizen, 2020).

Both these labor supply and demand side perspectives on the role of agriculture would suggest that increasing labor productivity during the structural transformation should mainly happen through a reduction of the agricultural labor force and that to do so, policies should especially focus on removing barriers to sectoral (and spatial) migration. Yet, even though popular, there are a number of important caveats to these perspectives. For example, recent evidence indicates that the frequently cited agricultural productivity gap measures based on the national accounts abstract from a series of confounding factors and measurement issues, which exaggerate the gap. This suggests that the gains from sectoral movements, and thus the incentives to move, may not be as large as commonly purported. Furthermore, the view that labor is less productive in agriculture --a viewpoint that is especially well established in macro policy circles --has often also been taken as evidence that labor in agriculture is intrinsically less productive, and thus less worthy of investment. This sits oddly with the agricultural success stories of agro-exporters such as the United States and the Netherlands, and more recently also Vietnam, Chile, and Peru.

Countries with an HDI score of 0.8 or higher, and a Footprint of 1.8 global hectares per person or lower, meet two minimum criteria for global sustainable development: a high level of development and an Ecological Footprint per person that could be globally replicated to a level less than global biocapacity.

Strong yield growth in rice , cashew , and cotton diversified the cash crop mix , but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products .	Strong yield growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversified the cash crop mix, but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products. Overall, net agricultural production value increased by 2.5 percent per year (between 2004/06 and 2011/13). The annual increase was higher in rice (11.5 percent), other export crops (4.2 percent) (driven especially by cashew and cotton),57 and meat (3.3 percent, especially chicken [9.2 percent] and cattle) (Figure3.5). This resulted in a rising share of rice in total output (from 3.5 percent on average during 2004/06 to 6.2 percent during 2011/13) and a diversification in cash crops beyond cocoa (whose share declined from 26.6 percent to 24.2 percent). Diversification in high-value agricultural products (meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables) remains limited. The share of meat increased only slightly from 7.9 percent to 8.3 percent, while the share of other high-value agricultural products decreased slightly from 16.5 percent to 15.8 percent). 56 The 2013 national employment survey (ENSETE 2013) puts the average rice yields at 1.8 tons per ha (rising to 2 tons per ha in the subsequent 2015 national household survey ENV 2015) --though the median is only 600 and 1000 kg per ha, respectively. This is substantially lower than the averages reported in the macro data from the national statistics, which rose from slightly below 2 tons/ha during the mid-2000s to about 5 tons/ha in 2013-2014. This discrepancy between the macro and micro data (or national/administrative and survey statistics) warrants further investigation. Some of the discrepancy may be the result from the fact that the household surveys capture only one of the rice harvests. They also exclude large commercial farms where yields are higher (higher input use, better water control, and typically more than one rice cycle per year). 57 The value of coffee and pineapple production declined.

In almost all regions , the practice is rooted in culture and the economics of son preference , these factors playing a major role in the low valuation and neglect of female children .	"In almost all regions, the practice is rooted in culture and the economics of son preference, these factors playing a major role in the low valuation and neglect of female children. The practice of son preference emerged with the shift from subsistence agriculture, which was primarily controlled by women, to settled agriculture, which is primarily controlled by men. In the patrilineal landowning communities with settled agriculture which are prevalent in the Asian region, the economic obligations of sons towards parents are greater. The son is considered to be the family pillar, who ensures continuity and protection of the family property. Sons provide the workforce and have to bring in a bride-""an extra pair of hands"". Sons are the source of family income and have to provide for parents in their old age. They are also the interpreters of religious teachings and the performers of rituals, especially on the death of parents, which include feeding a large number of people, sometimes several villages. As soldiers, sons protect the community and hold political power."

Infrastructure has also improved, with particularly impressive growth in the number of airlines and route capacity. Despite these gains, world-class infrastructure remains concentrated among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The Gulf countries have been able to use their natural resource wealth, central geographic location and relative security to develop world-class T&T infrastructure, defined by quality airports, ports, roads, tourist services and some of the world's leading airlines. These efforts are in stark contrast to some other MENA nations that--due to a lack of investment and ongoing instability--have yet to develop competitive infrastructure, especially regarding air transport. Similarly, the region's above-average score on the Enabling Environment subindex is due to the performance of the Gulf countries and Israel, which have developed economies, strong business environments, ICT readiness and some of the highest scores in safety and security. Finally, most regional economies also score near the bottom when it comes to female participation in the labour market, depriving the T&T industry of a greater labour and skills pool.

With changes in technology and the organization of work, permanent jobs are becoming by the Russian Federation. The number of highperforming students in the city of Shanghai alone is one-fifth of that of Germany and about double that of Argentina.35 Skills are not one-dimensional, however. Different jobs require different combinations of manual skills (needed for physical tasks), cognitive skills (needed for mental tasks), and social skills (needed to interact with others). The distribution of employment by occupation can be used to estimate the skill intensity of production. As incomes rise, countries tend to use fewer manual skills in production, and more nonroutine cognitive skills. 36 However, even for a given level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, countries can use nonroutine skills to varying degrees (figure 1.6).37 Technological progress expands the possibilities for emerging and even low-income countries to create jobs in higher-skilled production activities as well as to link to international value chains in services and manufacturing. In other words, technological progress enables countries to diverge from a linear evolutionary path from manual skill intensity to the use of higher-order cognitive and social skills.38 India and China top the list of countries in an index measuring their F I G U R E 1. 5 Labor productivity remains low in developing countries Source: World Development Indicators.

Most commonly , however , this information is available online through the Ministry of Health 's website .	The Nordic region authorizes nursing professionals who have completed their mandatory education and other requirements by granting a nursing license and/or registration. Overall, registration is required in most Nordic countries except for Iceland, which requires a nursing license. Finland and Sweden require both registration and licensure. Denmark, Finland, Greenland, Norway, and Sweden all require passing a licensure examination (or its foreign equivalent) to become a nurse or midwife. The Faroe Islands has the authority to issue a licensure examination, but information about whether an examination is required is not publicly available. No examination is currently administered in Iceland, although the regulatory body has the authority to require one. Once registered and/or licensed, a public database is typically the means by which a nursing professional's credentials are verifiable. This may take the form of a physical document, such as a journal, newspaper or gazette stored at the Ministry's headquarters. Most commonly, however, this information is available online through the Ministry of Health's website. Denmark, Finland, the Faroe Islands, and Norway all maintain an online database of registered nursing professionals that is accessible to the public. Sweden does not maintain an online database but allows an individual to attain information about a nurse via formal online or mail request. Iceland does not appear to maintain a public database, while Greenland's regulatory body provides the public with access to the register in hard copy, housed at the National Board of Governors and Health headquarters. In addition to verifying a nursing professional's credentials, notifications of past or current disciplinary actions are also publicly accessible as part of a nursing registry. The NRBs of Denmark and Sweden also review criminal backgrounds of potential nurses. No information regarding criminal background checks was found for other Nordic countries.

As such , inequality in access to education is particularly marked among women .	Female enrollment in primary education is particularly low in Coted'Ivoire. Enrollment in primary education lags other Sub-Saharan African developing countries, and the problem appears most acute among females (Figures 6.2a and 6.2b). Before the conflict that began in 2002 enrollment of females in primary school in Coted'Ivoire stood about 15 percentage points below the regional average at 65 percent compared to 80 percent, while enrollment of males was closer at 88 percent compared to 93 percent. Both the enrollment of boys and girls was detrimentally affected by the conflict and crises. However, by 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, male enrollment had recovered to 96 percent compared to a regional average of 103 percent, while female enrollment stood at 84 percent, still more than 10 percentage points below the regional average of 96 percent. As such, inequality in access to education is particularly marked among women. This analysis can be complemented with other Coted'Ivoire specific sources of information on GERs, such as the 2012 Demographic Health Survey and the 2013 Employment Survey (ENSETE 2013). While these show higher aggregate GERs of 95.7 percent and 100.8 percent, respectively, they also uncover gender gaps with the male/ female rates being 101.9 percent / 89.3 percent and 107.3 percent / 94.3 percent, respectively.

Aspects of Service Exports Services can be crucial in stimulating goods exports and are critical in maintaining those transactions. Many U.S. merchandise exports would not take place if they were not supported by such service activities as banking, insurance, and transportation. The many obvious differences between services and products include differences in tangibility and customer involvement. Because services are intangible, you may find that communicating a service offer is more difficult than communicating a product offer. Also, services frequently must be tailored to the specific needs of the client. Such adaptation often necessitates the client's direct participation and cooperation.

A recent global study developed a Global Investment Framework for Women 's and Children 's Health and estimates the benefits and cost of an integrated package of interventions aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality , including the provision of conditional cash transfers to improve access to effective care during pregnancy , childbirth and the postnatal period .	When discussing affordability, it is also important to assess and contrast the costs of providing adequate maternity protection relative to the cost of not providing it. Its lack is a major factor in poverty, inequality and social exclusion. When a woman dies or becomes ill, her family and community lose the fruits of her productivity and her income. Her children are much more likely to drop out of school, to suffer poor health, even to die. A recent global study developed a Global Investment Framework for Women's and Children's Health and estimates the benefits and cost of an integrated package of interventions aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality, including the provision of conditional cash transfers to improve access to effective care during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. It shows that increasing health expenditure by just US$5 per person per year up to 2035 in 74 highly affected countries could yield up to nine times that value in economic and social benefits. These returns include greater GDP growth through improved productivity and labour force participation, as well as prevention of 32 million stillbirths and the deaths of 147 million children and 5 million women by 2035.

The main distinguishing features of indigenous peoples' protected areas have to do with the sociopolitical arrangements that are established between indigenous peoples and national authorities for the government of lands and resources in indigenous peoples' lands. Basically such features are that: 1. They are based upon the collective rights of the respective indigenous people, nation or community to lands, territories and resources, under national contexts; 2. They are established as protected areas in application of the right of self-determination, exercised mainly through: * Self-declaration of the protected area by the indigenous people or nation with collective territorial rights on the area; * Free, prior and informed consent of the people, nation or community with territorial rights on the area, in cases where the designation proposal is originated in government agencies, conservation organizations or other actors. 3. They are based on ancestral or traditional occupation; 4. Occupation, use and management are connected to and dependent upon the broader socio-cultural and political structure of a people or nation, which includes their customary law and institutions; 5. They are self-governed by indigenous institutions within their territories and the protected areas contained therein, in application of arrangements established with system-level protected area authorities. 3.

The region of Central America and the Caribbean continues to be used as a major trans-shipment area for consignments of drugs originating in South America and destined for North America and Europe. In the Caribbean, countries have begun playing an increasing role as secondary distribution points for cocaine shipments to Europe.26 Impunity, corruption and weak institutions undermine drug control efforts and the rule of law in the region, despite attempts to reform law enforcement and judicial systems. Drug trafficking activities are often carried out under the protection of local gangs (maras) operating in border areas, especially in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. 355. There are indications that links have been established between drug cartels and criminal organizations operating in the region. Law enforcement authorities have reported a significant change in trafficking patterns, with drug traffickers cancelling confirmed flights at the last minute, only to make bookings immediately thereafter on the same flight, in an attempt to avoid detection during the process of screening the passenger list.27 356.

Technology will play a big role and could fundamentally change the way that the financial system works. Although it is very difficult to predict exactly how this will play out, both banking and particularly the asset management industry could be particularly ripe for disruption. Advances in digital technology could enable more and more people to move towards self-directed investment using online platforms, fundamentally changing how the current industry works. I see this as a huge growth area going forwards for new entrants. There is also an interesting question as to where technological innovation will come from in future. Traditionally, it has mostly come from areas like Silicon Valley, but with success stories such as Alibaba in China, it may be the case that we will start to see more innovation coming from the East.

"There is renewed interest in the agricultural sector as an engine of growth and development and greater recognition of the importance of women in agriculture. However, without tools for measuring the impact of agricultural interventions on women's empowerment, the impacts of programs on empowerment (or disempowerment) are likely to receive much less attention than income or other more measurable outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for measures of empowerment that are robust, inclusive, and comparable over time and space. Indexes that capture many different dimensions provide a summary measure that allows for comparability. Because most indexes and indicators used in monitoring development progress on gender equity have little coverage of the agricultural sector, whereas many agriculture-related indicators are gender-blind, there is a clear need for a tool to measure and monitor the impact of agricultural interventions on empowerment of women within the agricultural sector (Kishor and Subaiya 2008; Malhotra and Schuler 2005). As noted by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (2012), ""Data not only measures progress, it inspires it. . . . What gets measured gets done. Once you start measuring problems, people are more inclined to take action to fix them because nobody wants to end up at the bottom of a list of rankings."" The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a new survey-based index designed to measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. The WEAI was initially developed as a tool to reflect women's empowerment that may result from the US government's Feed the Future Initiative, which commissioned the development of the WEAI. However, the WEAI or adaptations of it can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time."

""The lack of political will and commitment to ending patronage and politicisation within the Bangladesh civil service prevents any radical reform of the public service in Bangladesh"".10 The politicisation of administration has left the Bangladesh civil service divided, has broken its chain of command and hierarchy and weakened its internal and external accountability mechanisms.11 Certain aspects of politicisation - such as transfers to 'officers on special duty' - are intensely disliked by the bureaucracy, which remain for the majority apolitical. At the same time, the country is often said to be run by a handful of bureaucrats that enjoy power and prestige for being allied to the party in power."

The project is used by NCA & T as a successful example in the briefing of visitors .	Strength: NCA32 Project Team consists of young professionals and technical experts who work well together. They have achieved significant outputs, and turned around a low-performing project in the past four years. Selection of a good and dedicated Principal Investigator was a key action taken by the NCA&T management, as well as sustained financial support for the project team, and providing solutions for their problems. For example, data obtained from the Peanut CRSP project was critical in securing USDA, CSREES funding for research on other aspects of value-added use of peanut and peanut by-products. Hence, Peanut CRSP was key in bringing together a peanut research program with funding from various sources at NCA&T Strength: EEP met with three members of NCA&T management (Associate Dean, Department Head, and Peanut CRSP TC). They fully support the Principal Investigator and scientists working in the project, and were quite pleased with the significant outputs that they have accomplished. The project is used by NCA&T as a successful example in the briefing of visitors. NCA&T procured about US$200,000 worth of equipment to complete the laboratories needed by the Project NCA32U - 299 - project team. The management solved the problem of transfer of funds to Host Country collaborating institution by changing from reimbursement of expenditures scheme to advanced fund release scheme. Strength: The result of the work in aflatoxin detoxification could provide a bridge between agricultural and health issues. Expansion of Peanut CRSP initiative to public health aspects of peanut research (i.e., aflatoxin, peanut allergies, HIV AIDS) would allow joint research by agriculture and health scientists. In Senegal, other funding sources from Belgium, Canada and France are supporting research programs in these areas and leveraging Peanut CRSP.

Although traveling is expensive and your time is valuable , an overloaded schedule can be counterproductive .	A well-planned itinerary enables you to make the best use of your time abroad. Although traveling is expensive and your time is valuable, an overloaded schedule can be counterproductive. Two or three definite appointments, confirmed well in advance and spaced comfortably throughout a day, are more productive and enjoyable than a crowded agenda that forces you to rush from one meeting to the next before business is really concluded. If possible, you should plan an extra day to rest to deal with jet lag before starting your scheduled business appointments. As you plan your trip, keep in mind: * The travel plans should reflect your company's goals and priorities. * You should obtain the names of possible contacts, arrange appointments, and check transportation schedules before the trip begins. The most important meetings should be confirmed before you leave the United States. The U.S. Commercial Service can offer assistance through programs such as business matchmaking. Refer to Chapter 6 for additional information. * As a rule, you should keep your schedule flexible enough to allow for both unexpected problems (such as transportation delays) and unexpected opportunities. However, accepting an unscheduled luncheon invitation from a prospective client should not keep you from missing the next scheduled meeting. * You should confirm the normal workdays and business hours in the countries being visited. In many Middle Eastern countries, for instance, the workweek typically runs from Saturday to Thursday. Lunchtimes that last 2 to 4 hours are customary in many countries. * You should also contact a U.S. Commercial Service office to learn of any travel advisories issued by the U.S. Department of State for countries you plan to visit. Advisories alert travelers to potentially dangerous in-country situations. The U.S. Department of State also includes travel advisories at state.gov.

The development of profitable lowland rice technologies is therefore a central element in strategies to induce farmers to reduce pressure on rapidly degraded uplands by shifting cultivation to lowland ecosystems .	Rice, environmental degradation, and sustainable intensification In highly populated areas of West Africa, rising cropping intensity in fragile upland ecosystems has already begun to degrade the resource base, with environmental damage and loss in production potential. Rice has a key role to play in providing options for sustainable intensification. Rice is uniquely well adapted to flooded lowland ecosystems where the soils are least fragile and best able to support continuous cultivation. The development of profitable lowland rice technologies is therefore a central element in strategies to induce farmers to reduce pressure on rapidly degraded uplands by shifting cultivation to lowland ecosystems. Relative to other cereals, rice also responds more to improved management and to higher inputs of nutrients, water control, and labor, and is thus favored as production systems intensify.

An aspect that is beginning to gain more importance is the use of models to set breeding goals. The physiological attributes that contribute significantly to crop production in a given environment lend themselves to definition by crop modeling. Models can serve to bridge between functional genomics, ecophysiology, and agronomy. Ecophysiological models are used to analyze the influence of different plant parameters (e.g., plant architecture, nutrient status, partitioning) on desired agronomic traits such as yield, weed competitiveness, or drought tolerance. Functional genomics supplies genetic markers for these traits, which then assist breeders during the selection process.

This scheme replaces one which was based on the English pattern culminating in A levels and a three-year first degree course. The introduction of the 8-4-4 education system has led to tremendous changes in the secondary school curriculum. This is in line with the need for a broad-based curriculum that prepares students for self-reliance, vocational training and further education.

DOING BUSINESS 202068 In 2007 the Nigerian government awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a local road. The works were slated to begin in 2009, but the project specifications had been designed six years before the contract was awarded. By the time the contractor started the works, the condition of the road had deteriorated significantly. The project was awarded at less than 60% of the cost required to execute it. At the expiration of the contract period in June 2012, the project was only 8% complete.1 A decade after the contract award, rehabilitation works were still underway and a trip that would typically take one hour took four.2 Delays and cost overruns are not the only results of nonfunctioning public procurement. The waste of taxpayer money is the worst consequence. Bribes also abound. In Honduras, the now-defunct highway fund, Fondo Vial, awarded contracts to businesses run by a drug cartel to conduct road maintenance in exchange for bribes.3 The contracting with the government indicator set--Doing Business's latest area of research--benchmarks the efficiency of the entire public procurement life cycle, with a focus on the infrastructure sector.

Key challenges were the set up of the modem/remote terminals and interconnec1on of the ICT tools at the hospital and clinics, during the lock-down. Local technical personnel undertook this task successfully. Another challenge is the funding of such project. The requirement and need for such service is a fact, and it is a service that it is greatly required. The health communi1es in these remote areas of Africa rely on ins1tu1onal funding like UNPD and World bank and other funding to financially support these must-have services. For this project Hellas Sat has partnered with Africom Holdings, a leading converged communica1on service provider. A licensed telecommunica1ons operator; Africom is the first company in Zimbabwe to challenge all conven1on by offering converged communica1on solu1ons.

Equipment needed for the provision of the service are already in place and available. The benefits for using them in combina1on with satellite broadband will eventually create the required resources (financially) for the con1nua1on of the project.

Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all persons with disabilities (Goal 4) This section focuses on the realization of Goal 4 for persons with disabilities. Goal 4 calls for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting life-long learning opportunities for all. While all targets of Goal 4 are crucial in achieving equal education for persons with disabilities, only two targets explicitly mention disability, namely target 4.5 which aims inter alia at ensuring equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities; and target 4.a that calls for building and upgrading education facilities that are disability sensitive and providing inclusive learning environments for all. This section presents the international normative framework on disability and education and addresses the challenges persons with disabilities face in accessing education on the basis of available evidence. It also discusses current practices in countries regarding access to education of persons with disabilities and presents examples of national policies and best practices as well as recommendations to advance inclusive education.

Large infrastructure projects , such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions , have made it easier to move around the country .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

It asks : In a given year , did human demand on ecosystems exceed the ability of ecosystems to meet this demand ?	Does the Ecological Footprint matter if the supply of renewable resources can be increased and advances in technology can slow the depletion of non-renewable resources? The Ecological Footprint measures the current state of resource use and waste generation. It asks: In a given year, did human demand on ecosystems exceed the ability of ecosystems to meet this demand? Footprint analysis reflects both increases in the productivity of renewable resources (for example, if the productivity of cropland is increased, then the Footprint of 1 tonne of wheat will decrease) and technological innovation (for example, if the paper industry doubles the overall efficiency of paper production, the Footprint per tonne of paper will be cut by half ). Ecological Footprint accounts capture these changes as they occur and can determine the extent to which these innovations have succeeded in bringing human demand within the capacity of the planet's ecosystems. If there is a sufficient increase in ecological supply and a reduction in human demand due to technological advances or other factors, Footprint accounts will show this as the elimination of global overshoot.

Thus , agricultural innovations that greatly increase labor burdens may have a negative effect , even if incomes increase , whereas labor-saving technologies may benefit women even if they do not OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 8 improve production or incomes .	These domains also reflect aspects of empowerment found in the literature. The first domain follows directly from Kabeer's (2001) or Alsop, Bertelsen, and Holland's (2006) definitions of empowerment as ability to make choices, in this case in key areas of agricultural production. The resource domain reflects control over assets that enable one to act on those decisions: a woman may decide to plant trees, but if she does not have rights to the land or credit to purchase inputs, she may not be able to do so. Thus, the resource domain combines both whether the woman can potentially make decisions over the asset--because her household possesses it--and whether, in fact, she decides how to use it. Control over income is a key domain for exercising choice, and it reflects whether a person is able to benefit from her or his efforts. This is especially important in agriculture because, in many cases, even where women produce crops or livestock, they are marketed by men who then keep most of the income. The leadership domain captures key aspects of inclusion and participation, accountability, and local organizational capacity, which Narayan (2002) cites as key elements of empowerment. Finally, time, like income, reflects the ability of women to enjoy the benefits from agricultural production. Women's time constraints not only are a burden on women themselves but can negatively affect the care and welfare of children and other family members as well. Thus, agricultural innovations that greatly increase labor burdens may have a negative effect, even if incomes increase, whereas labor-saving technologies may benefit women even if they do not OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 8 improve production or incomes. Labor-saving technologies that reduce the time women need to spend on domestic work may also give them more freedom to choose among activities--choices that are empowering if these options had not been available in the past. The remainder of this section briefly describes the indicators used for each of the domains and their grounding in the theoretical and empirical literature on gender and agriculture.

Others refer to the volume of human inputs used in production, bringing images of effort and conveying a sense of physical exertion. There are also words associated with the sheer numbers of people engaged in economic activity, which are more easily associated with aggregate statistics. In other cases, what seems to be at stake is a contractual relationship, involving mutual obligations and a degree of stability. In some languages, there are even words to designate the place where the person works, or at least a slot in a production process.

Voice beyond the firm Employers' organizations and unions also play roles as social and political agents. They may influence the laws that regulate labor markets and even policies beyond the sphere of labor relations. The nature of such involvement depends on the norms and institutional framework in the society in which they operate. Historically, labor unions have contributed to the establishment of social and labor rights, as well as to political change, in many countries. For instance, With unemployment rates well above 20 percent, the South African labor market is very different from that of other developing countries, usually characterized by low or moderate levels of open unemployment. Diverse explanations have been put forward, including growth concentrated in low-labor-intensity sectors, skills deficits, work disincentives created by social benefits, and various legacies of apartheid. South Africa's distinct collective bargaining arrangements are also frequently mentioned as a possible explanation for the lack of jobs.

Due to the high degree of urbanization in both countries, infrastructure investments that lead to a reduction in resource consumption will be important. trade and the ecological Footprint Both China and Germany are reliant on net imports from other countries to balance their ecological deficits. China has developed into a global hub for product manufacturing. Its trade relations are characterized by raw material imports (e.g., metals and wood from Latin America, oil and cotton from Africa, or wool from Australia), of which only a quarter remain in the country. Changing Chinese consumption habits that have accompanied an improved standard of living (such as increasing meat and milk consumption) are demanding a growing number of imports, namely, agricultural and grazing land products. Although a major portion of resources leave China again in the form of finished products (e.g., paper, furniture or textiles) for the USA, Japan, Australia, South Korea and the EU, overall imports exceeded exports in 2005; the trade balance in this year was negative. Germany, on the other hand, had a positive trade balance and exported more than was imported in 2005; the German Footprint of consumption was 0.4 gha per capita smaller than the production Footprint.

Many cannot afford to take time away from work to continue nursing or caring for their infants and young children .	"After childbirth, many women face the risk of poverty as a result of losing their job and its income. Many cannot afford to take time away from work to continue nursing or caring for their infants and young children. Without workplace support, working is incompatible with breastfeeding. This is because breast milk production operates on supply and demand; if a woman does not have breaks to either breastfeed or express milk, her supply will diminish and she may no longer be able to produce enough milk for her baby. Indeed, throughout the world, returning to work is a major factor in women's decisions to quit or to reduce breastfeeding (Fein and Roe, 1998; Kearney and Cronenwett, 1991; Mandal et al., 2010; Ogbuanu et al., 2011), raising the risks of food-and water-borne illnesses and diarrhoea and reducing the nutritional and developmental benefits of breastfeeding.1 The international labour standards recognize that supporting breastfeeding is an integral part of the set of maternity protection measures and set out rights and guidance for assisting mothers to continue breastfeeding on their return to work. Breastfeeding promotes child survival, health and development (see, for example, WHO, 2009; Anderson et al., 1999) as well as providing significant health benefits for mothers (see for example, Demer, 2001).2 Breastfeeding support at work provides one element of maternity protection which can be a ""win-win scenario"" for both employers and employees, providing no or low cost a measure which can result in considerable benefits to both companies and society as a whole, as well as extensive savings for health-care systems. Nevertheless, the benefits that employers gain from supporting breastfeeding employees remain underexplored and there is strong evidence for the persisting barriers that impede the continuation of (particularly exclusive) breastfeeding upon return to paid employment (Lewis et al., forthcoming). The workplace and its actors can therefore make an important contribution in enabling mothers to continue breastfeeding on their return to work, including by informing employers and employees of the health benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and their infants as well as the positive outcomes at firm level."

A range of pull factors , including earning potentials , attract individuals into the sector .	There is a wide variety of informal nonagricultural self-employment activities in Coted'Ivoire, and many individuals choose to operate in the sector. From a legalistic standpoint, being informal means that the establishment (operating unit) or the employee is not registered. As in many countries in the region, the median owner of a nonagricultural microenterprise tends to be young females with no formal education. The majority of nonagricultural individual enterprises are in small-scale service activities, but these enterprises persist over time. In fact, in contrast to common perceptions, many individuals declare preferring self-employment over other types of occupations. A range of pull factors, including earning potentials, attract individuals into the sector. For rural households, nonagricultural activities represent a source of income diversification to mitigate harvest risks or seasonal variations, and often a pathway out of poverty. Still, as Chapter3 has highlighted, off-farm diversification remains limited in rural Coted'Ivoire and there might be scope to further encourage it.

The main challenges are related to (self) organization, in time and effort, caused by the unexpected current pandemic situation that has forced us to work from home. It is more demanding to follow (and succeed in) an online course, compared to face-toface course. And the risk of drop-out is much bigger too than in face-to-face courses. Continuous assistance and mentoring are the key to fight these challenges. Partnership would be most welcome to explore one aspect of the project in which an IT specialist is needed, i.e. data science, artificial intelligence, and semantic scholarship. Funding could allow us to hire specific services (e.g. administrative support), and/or to provide for scholarships (e.g. research scholarship). Other types of partnerships are envisioned for instance with political/official stakeholders in education. A strong innovating social entrepreneurship spirit has kept the project self-sustained. The principles of open access and open science we have been following are aligned with the Portuguese national strategy for digital skills (Portugal INCoDe.2030) and, at an international level, particularly with the SDG 4. It all started in only one school. In this school year we have been working with 6 schools. We were reaching only the district of Lisboa, and now we are also reaching the district of Santarem. In the near future, we expect to further replicate the project (e.g. in the United Republic of Tanzania), aiming at continuing to foster the development of digital skills and competences, including ICT and informational, on an individual or global-society scale, ultimately where most needed in close alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

In 2002 , farm level surveys were carried out in selected rural communities in Senegal to collect data on farming , post-harvest processing , storage , and health issues related to aflatoxin .	The overall research approach at Virginia Tech has been multi-disciplinary, in close collaboration with the Host Country Project Team. In Senegal, three departments were involved in this project: (1) Department of Food Science for the analysis of aflatoxin levels in peanut on farm, in storage, and in the markets; and review of food preparation practices; (2) Department of Agronomy on farming, harvesting, and post-harvest practices related to minimizing aflatoxin contamination; and (3) Social Sciences Department on gender analysis of farming and related activities, experimental methodologies for health education, and gender and health training. In 2002, farm level surveys were carried out in selected rural communities in Senegal to collect data on farming, post-harvest processing, storage, and health issues related to aflatoxin. The survey involved first year students from ENEA who collected data as part of their official activities; a report was prepared in 2003. Due to slow progress, the project was transferred to Uganda in June 2003 and project coordination was transferred to the Department of Food Science and Technology at Makerere University in Kampala. A field-level mini-survey was carried out in May 2003 in three villages to collect farming and post-harvest practices related to peanuts and aflatoxin. The survey was carried out by two Virginia Tech Teams and the Makerere University coordinator. Then a farm-level survey was carried out in 2003-2004 in four villages in the peanut growing areas of Uganda (in Mubende, Iganga, and Mayuge Districts) to assess the aflatoxin level in peanuts which was initially determined to be high by the IPM CRSP team. The survey carried out by a Ugandan graduate student. Another survey was carried out in 2003-04 on knowledge, attitudes, and practices of peanut traders, wholesalers and retailers in Uganda, in selected markets in Uganda. Analysis of the aflatoxin content of peanut samples collected on farm, in storage, and in five market centers were carried out by the Ugandan Project Investigator. 3 outputs/achievements .

What areas are vibrant and healthy, or distinctively positive? Weaknesses:  What do we do less well?  What areas of ""weakness"" do we encounter? Opportunities:  What are the needs of the stakeholders, and what trends can we take advantage of?  What is changing in the community or in society? Threats:  Are there new rules and regulations that place demands and limits on the stakeholders?  What is changing in the community or country that will impact us? During the SWOT exercise, each participant received sticky notes, three for each SWOT category. The participants were instructed to work individually and write down three strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats on the sticky notes, representing each of the four SWOT quadrants. Once all the quadrants were complete, participants were asked to group like ideas and then label the ""cluster."" The participants reflected on the outcomes from their activities and agreed that the clusters were representative of the assets, opportunities, and challenges as it relates to sustainable intensification. The facilitators at all three sessions reminded the participants that the purpose of the exercise was to generate ideas and feedback, not come to consensus on any particular item or issue. Rather, it was entirely conceivable that an issue could be identified in multiple categories (i.e., be both a strength and a weakness).

Because of its importance , we must continue to focus on this favorable environment as the major source of rice supply to meet the growing demand from the expanding urban population and the rural landless .	Enhancing productivity and sustainability of favorable environments The major factor in poverty alleviation in recent years has been the reduction in the unit cost of production and the downward trend in real prices of food. Improved technologies were adopted fastest in the favorable irrigated environment, which accounts for nearly 45% of the rice land and more than 70% of total rice production. Because of its importance, we must continue to focus on this favorable environment as the major source of rice supply to meet the growing demand from the expanding urban population and the rural landless. The challenges are how to sustain the high yields already achieved in this ecosystem and whether modern science can be used to explore possibilities of a further shiftin yield potential. The options for extending the area under high-yielding modern rice varieties by developing irrigation infrastructure will no longer be available for many countries because of the looming water crisis. Farmers need assistance from rice scientists on how to grow rice with less water and how to operate irrigation systems more efficiently. Technological options must be developed to maintain soil fertility and control pest pressure.

Natural Resources (5 indicators): Countries with natural assets clearly have a competitive advantage in attracting tourists. In this pillar we include a number of attractiveness measures, including the number of UNESCO natural World Heritage sites, a measure of the quality of the natural environment which proxies the beauty of its landscape, the richness of the fauna in the country as measured by the total known species of animals, and the percentage of nationally protected areas, which proxies the extent of national parks and nature reserves. 14. Cultural Resources and Business Travel (5 indicators): A country's cultural resources are another critical driver of T&T competitiveness. In this pillar we include the number of UNESCO cultural World Heritage sites, the number of large stadiums that can host significant sport or entertainment events, and a new measure of digital demand for cultural and entertainment--the number of online searches related to a country's cultural resources can allow the level of interest to be inferred. The number of international association meetings taking place in a country is included to capture, at least partially, business travel."

Accordingly , policies to improve access to finance need to pay attention to firm and sector heterogeneity .	Accordingly, policies to improve access to finance need to pay attention to firm and sector heterogeneity. The country's low score on the Doing Business 'getting credit' indicators, for example, is driven by the lack of a credit bureau or credit registry, sharing of credit information, and a movable collateral registry, which negatively affects the allocation of credit in the economy and often impacts smaller firms disproportionally. Alternatively, to alleviate capital constraints, one might consider policies to attract foreign investments in sectors that are more financially constrained. These policies need not be blunt instruments such as tax incentives but could be targeted investment climate policies that would encourage foreign entry in certain sectors. In addition, low returns to capital in certain sectors and types of firms can be caused by constraints in complementary inputs such as skilled labor. Therefore, policies that do not consider other complementary inputs might fall short of alleviating firms' constraints to grow.

The American Cancer Society Strengthening Organizations for a United Response to the Cancer Epidemic ( SOURCE ) Program is designed to strengthen the civil society response to cancer across the continuum from prevention through end-of-life care in focus countries around the world .	Develop civil society capacity in cancer control globally. Many governments in LMICs are ill-prepared to address adequately the increasing burden of cancer. In many cases, civil society actors (nongovernmental organizations, institutions, and individuals) are also not yet fully engaged or coordinated in their cancer control efforts. The American Cancer Society Strengthening Organizations for a United Response to the Cancer Epidemic (SOURCE) Program is designed to strengthen the civil society response to cancer across the continuum from prevention through end-of-life care in focus countries around the world. This program provides intensive culturally appropriate training, technical assistance, mentoring, and practicum opportunities to cancer-focused organizations in LMICs focused on building and sustaining their capacity across seven key domains of organizational development: governance, financial management, financial sustainability, operations and administration, human resources management, program management, and external relations and partnerships. The program also facilitates the establishment of national cancer umbrella organizations to coordinate the civil society response and elevate the voice of all organizations, big and small, in the cancer fight. As part of the International Cancer Control Partnership, the American Cancer Society also supports country cancer control planning efforts.

The education system comprises of 3 stages, namely primary, secondary and tertiary education, with the rural poor falling away as years passed. The intention is that children enter the former at age 7, and remain there for 6 years, while they learn the basics of the same subjects that children learn everywhere. The secondary school model is a 2-tier one. After the first 4 of 7 years, examinations are held for the certificate of the lower cycle of secondary study, or brevet d'etude du premier cycle. With this in hand, students could go out to work, move on to a college or lycee, or enter a teacher-training institution. Those who remain on at secondary school for the balance of the period are entitled to apply to study at a university, if either of such exist.

In 2018 , the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) proposed a set of regulations called the Food Safety and Standards ( Labelling and Display ) Regulations , which is an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006 .	In 2018, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) proposed a set of regulations called the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, which is an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006. The proposed regulations would prescribe the labeling requirements for prepackaged foods to display essential information on where the food is manufactured, processed, served, and stored. The proposed regulation also allows FSSAI to establish an internal mechanism to address problems arising out of the implementation and/or interpretation of the regulations. The government of India mandated standard retail package sizes for 19 categories of foods and beverages effective November 1, 2012, via an amendment to the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011. This rule has not been notified to the WTO, nor was there a specific public comment period for domestic stakeholders prior to implementation. As the United States does not impose specific standards for packaging size, and U.S. package sizes tend to be in English rather than metric units, the list of package sizes prevents many U.S.-origin products from entering India. Attempts to import such U.S.-origin products have resulted in rejection at the port of entry. These standards have a negative effect on trade, with numerous U.S. brands effectively excluded from the Indian market. The United States continues to raise FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 241 concerns about these standards in various bilateral and multilateral fora in an effort to ensure that U.S. products have access to the Indian market.

The oil and gas related industries ( ISIC 11 and 23 ) are by far the highest-paying sectors .	This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across sectors, firm types, and over time. It also explores how the wage growth path is related to labor productivity and other firm-level characteristics. The analysis helps answer the following questions: (a) Are wages higher in large or small firms, firms creating jobs versus non-job creators? (b) Do wages increase with productivity, including productivity within firms and across sector? (c) How does this wage-productivity relationship vary by the extent of market competition? First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in wages across and within sectors, even after accounting for skill composition. Not surprisingly, most sectors pay better than agriculture. Somewhat unexpectedly, the food manufacturing sector has one of the lowest average wage. The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23) are by far the highest-paying sectors. Those in the public sector (75) are also among the highest-paying jobs, lending support to the argument that in many developing countries including Coted'Ivoire, high public wages might impose a wage floor effect for skilled workers in the private sector. This observation is consistent with the finding in Chapter1 that for the more educated --those at least upper-secondary education --public jobs are more prevalent that private wage employment in the formal sector.

ANDACCELERATINGPOVERTYREDUCTION With two-thirds of Coted'Ivoire's poor living in rural areas according to recent (2011) estimates and almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, raising labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and more inclusive employment generation in Coted'Ivoire. This also plays to its potential comparative advantage in cash crop production and takes advantage of the rising demand for high-value and processed agricultural produce following rising incomes and dietary diversification, especially among its large urban population. For the country to grasp these opportunities, agricultural labor productivity will need to be made competitive with off-farm opportunities in the cities. Otherwise the exit of youth out of agriculture, some degree of which is normal, will only accelerate.

The figure also indicates that the gender gap decreased slightly over time with female GER improving from 4 percent to 7 percent compared to male GER which increased from 8 percent to 10 percent over the same time period. The access by wealth quintile indicates that higher education is most likely accessed by affluent families and the trend indicates a worsening of the situation between 2008 and 2015.

For the WEAI , USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs , as follows : 1 .	The early literature on empowerment typically used one global measure for empowerment. For example, parents' education was often used to measure agency or decision-making within the household (Alkire 2007); husband's age and educational seniority have also been used to connote male control over women (for example, Cain 1984; Miller 1981). However, it is possible that agency differs across different spheres of life and can exist simultaneously in different ways. For example, a person can be fully employed as a wife and mother, excluded from the labor force by social conventions, and recently empowered to vote by political processes. Because such distinctions have policy relevance, it is important to identify and compare agency achievements in different domains rather than in one alone (Alkire 2007, 166). Because agency and empowerment are experienced with different tasks and can be described and measured with different domains, Alkire (2005) suggests that most measures of agency and empowerment should be domain specific. For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1. Production: This dimension concerns decisions about agricultural production and refers to sole or joint decision-making about food and cash crop farming, livestock and fisheries, and autonomy in agricultural production, with no judgment on whether sole or joint decision-making was better or reflected greater empowerment. 2. Resources: This dimension concerns ownership of, access to, and decision-making power about productive resources such as land, livestock, agricultural equipment, consumer durables, and credit. 3. Income: This dimension concerns sole or joint control over the use of income and expenditures. 4. Leadership: This dimension concerns leadership in the community, here measured by membership in economic or social groups and comfort speaking in public. 5. Time: This dimension concerns the allocation of time to productive and domestic tasks and satisfaction with the time available for leisure activities.	For the WEAI, USAID initially defined five domains that reflected priorities from its agricultural programs, as follows: 1.

In 2017, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) limited the number of active drivers on ride-sharing platforms, resulting in a shortage of supply and poor service. Other regulations have put maximum limits on dynamic pricing and minimum limits on driver hours. Together, these restrictions reduce the value that these services are able to provide to consumers and undermine the competitiveness of these services vis-a-vis local alternatives.

Over the past decade governments have increasingly turned to Doing Business as a repository of actionable, objective data providing unique insights into good practices worldwide as they have come to understand the importance of business regulation as a driving force of competitiveness. To ensure the coordination of efforts across agencies, economies such as Colombia, Kuwait, and Malaysia have formed regulatory reform committees. These committees use the Doing Business indicators as one input to inform their programs for improving the business environment. More than 70 other economies have also formed such committees. Governments have reported more than 3,800 regulatory reforms, 1,316 of which have been informed by Doing Business since 2003.7 Many economies share knowledge on the regulatory reform process related to the areas measured by Doing Business.

These new regulations included requirements that app-based transportation service providers maintain data servers within Bangladesh .	In October 2018, the controversial Digital Security Act was passed into law, which criminalizes a wide range of online activity, creating challenges for Internet-based platforms and digital media firms that depend on user-generated content. The Act criminalizes online activities such as publishing information that tarnishes the image of the state, spreads rumors, or hurts religious sentiment. The Act provides for criminal penalties up to $120,000 and up to 14 years in prison for certain infractions. The Information and Communication Technology Act authorizes the government of Bangladesh to access any computer system for the purpose of obtaining any information or data, and to intercept information transmitted through any computer resource. Under the Information and Communication Technology Act, the Government of Bangladesh may also prohibit the transmission of any data or voice call, and censor online communications. On several occasions in 2018, the BTRC ordered mobile operators to limit data transmissions for political reasons, and on November 19, 2018 instructed all international Internet gateway licensees to temporarily block a U.S. Voice over IP (VoIP) service supplier; the blockage lasted for one day. Such interference, even on a temporary basis, undermines the value of Internet-based services, decreasing the incentive to invest and raising costs for firms in the market. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority's (BRTA) Ride-Sharing service guidelines came into force in March 2018. These new regulations included requirements that app-based transportation service providers maintain data servers within Bangladesh. The guidelines also require that vehicles be registered for at least one year before providing ride-sharing services, and that drivers may only drive for one app-based service.

This high , unforeseen , and compulsory cost , as well as overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in the affordable mass facilities , prompted a flood of complaints by the Kenyan public ( The East African , 2020 ) .	In Bangladesh, rates of quarantine were initially high, with all 312 workers repatriated from Wuhan on 1 February institutionally quarantined. As the pandemic evolved, however, only about 10% of international returnees were quarantined, either in institutions or registered for self-quarantine. The remainder, mostly from upcoming hotspots in the Middle East and Europe, were able to enter freely, reflecting the considerable challenges of quarantining all international arrivals. As a result, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was due to local transmission, indicating that COVID-19 must have entered the country without detection. (c) Maintains 81 Any international travellers arriving in Kenya from 16 March onwards were obliged to undergo institutional quarantine for 14 days. Initially, institutional quarantine at government facilities received technical support from the CDC and other donors, and was to be free of charge for those quarantined. However, with the governmental response undergoing restructuring, as discussed in earlier chapters, there was no more donor involvement and all quarantine was payable, at costs ranging from US$ 20 per night for repurposed mass governmental facilities to applicable hotel rates for government-designated guesthouses and hotels. As affordable accommodation filled up rapidly, incoming travellers were forcibly assigned to increasingly expensive facilities (up to US$ 100 per night). This high, unforeseen, and compulsory cost, as well as overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in the affordable mass facilities, prompted a flood of complaints by the Kenyan public (The East African, 2020). There have been complaints over a lack of bedding, water, food, and cleaning supplies, including soaps and detergents, and reports that staff did not adhere to the government's own protocols, such as wearing face masks or other protective equipment, to ensure that those quarantined do not become exposed to the virus (HRW, 2020d). No action was taken until 6 May 2020, by which time most large quarantine facilities had closed and a free modality was introduced (Daily Nation, 2020c).

The dynamism of microenterprises matters not only for livelihoods but also for productivity growth. Large firms innovate more, but they are Many are located in rural areas, absorbing some labor slack during the low agricultural season (box 3.3). Across 18 developing countries, 44 percent of the people living on less than US$1 a day in urban areas, and 24 percent of those in rural areas, work in a nonagricultural business. On average, they do not earn much.44 Nonetheless, these nonfarm activities provide an important channel to diversify income for the poor. In nine Sub-Saharan African countries, most nonfarm jobs were generated by households starting businesses, rather than entering the rapidly expanding private wage sector. Despite being modest, earnings from household enterprises contribute to consumption much the same as earnings from wage employment do. And these small businesses offer an avenue for poor households to engage in gradually more productive activities.45 While microenterprises have a lackluster performance as a group, they are also very diverse. In middle-income countries, a significant share of the owners of micro-and small enterprises are as entrepreneurial as their peers in industrial countries. Their weak performance may be driven more by contextual factors such as limited access to credit and policy-induced barriers to access technologies and markets, than by limited capacity. In several Latin American countries, for example, entrants into selfemployment tend to be workers who have ac- Microenterprises in urban areas, and particularly those in the informal sector, tend to attract the attention of academics and policy makers. But microenterprises are prominent in rural areas as well. The surveys of micro-and small enterprises in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean show that fewer than half are in cities and towns with 20,000 inhabitants or more. The urban share reaches 46 percent in the Dominican Republic but is below 30 percent in all other countries surveyed. Even if rural towns are counted (generally, localities with 2,000 to 20,000 inhabitants), well over half of the enterprises are in strictly rural areas in most countries.

This chapter discusses UHC and a range of health, social and economic factors that influence the TB epidemic and the consequences of developing TB disease. Section 7.1 describes and explains a TB-SDG monitoring framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help focus attention on SDG-related indicators that are associated with trends in TB incidence. Analysis of these indicators can inform action in the health sector and beyond. Section 7.2 provides an overview of the status of progress towards UHC at global, regional and country levels, and a summary of WHO estimates of the resources required for progress towards UHC and other SDG health targets during the period 2016-2030. This includes presentation and discussion of the two SDG indicators for UHC as well as a third indicator of health expenditure per capita. Section 7.3 synthesizes results from national facility-based surveys of costs faced by TB patients and their households completed in 2016-2019 and highlights the implications of these results for approaches to TB service delivery, financing and social protection. Section 7.4 describes the status of four health-related risk factors for TB (diabetes, HIV infection, smoking and alcohol use) and seven other indicators (related to poverty, social protection, undernutrition, income growth, income inequality, housing quality and indoor air pollution) that are part of the TB-SDG monitoring framework.

Some varia articles 340 Appendices focus on the links between film and migration experiences in countries with a film industry .	"The experience of exile and life after it is also examined in the dossier ""Living, thinking, writing in exile"" (33/1, 2017) coordinated by the historian Ralph Schor, who strives to understand the paths and identity choices of a particular category of exiles: writers and thinkers. Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of oneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer's perspective. Some varia articles 340 Appendices focus on the links between film and migration experiences in countries with a film industry. In what way do cinema and photography open up new discursive spaces? A special richly illustrated dossier is devoted to the links between photography, migration and cities (32/3-4, 2016). How cinema and photography reflect migrants' migratory experiences, imaginations, living, housing and working conditions? These articles also show how images contribute to current events and the production of memory, instilling emotions, reflections, mobilizations and denunciations."

Higher unemployment among young people, especially women, can be attributed to several factors, including the lack 18 Analysis conducted by the United Nations Statistics Division based on the ILO, Estimates and Projections of the Economically Active Population (EAPEP), 2013 edition (April 2014 update). of needed work skills due to limited job experience and a mismatch between young women and men's skill supply and labour market demand.19 In many countries, the gains in education have outpaced economic development and the demands of the labour market. Women are particularly susceptible to skills mismatch due to the fields of study they favour, such as education and humanities and arts (see Chapter 3 on Education). Finally, in countries where public sector jobs are associated with higher social status, stability and even better pay, young women and men may choose to be unemployed until a public sector job is available.20 In 2015, unemployment rates for young women and young men were twice or even three times higher than for adults in the majority of the regions analysed (figure 4.5). The Caribbean, Northern Africa, Southern Europe, and Western Asia have the highest unemployment rates for young people and some of the largest disparities between them and other adult workers.

A new investment code is being developed to focus on priority sectors such as agriculture , agribusiness , health , and hotel business .	Cote d'Ivoire has restrictions on and requires prior approval for foreign investment in the health sector, law and accounting firms, and travel agencies, particularly in terms of required local licenses. In negotiating the terms of an investment, the government will often require local content to be used; for example, the government may require the investor to procure products locally and hire local personnel rather than bringing them from abroad. Majority foreign ownership of companies in these sectors is not permitted, though foreign companies currently operate in all these sectors in partnership with local firms and with government permission. The Ivoirian investment code provides tax incentives for investments larger than $1 million, as well as land concessions for projects. Concessionary agreements that exempt investors from tax regulations require the additional approval of the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Ministry of Industry. The clearance procedure for planned investments, if tax breaks are sought, is time consuming and confusing. Even when companies have complied fully with the requirements, tax exemptions are sometimes denied with little explanation, giving rise to accusations of favoritism. The government has undertaken reforms to attract and facilitate investment.

The program has also focused on the connection between agriculture and health (particularly aflatoxin and immunity in humans) now being recognized as important by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The earlier discoveries of enterosorption of aflatoxin are providing a totally new approach to the management of this problem in developing countries. Major impacts have been realized in the animal feeding industries worldwide and the importance of this research has been recognized by BIFAD. The program has been successful in adapting cutting edge science to host country problems. Contributions have been made in biotechnology, health science, food technology, and socio-economic analyses. International exchanges have benefited U.S. agriculture through improved germplasm, integrated pest management, and non-traditional peanut products. The early decision to work across the full value chain of the crop was visionary, since the program is already addressing the new USAID Peanut CRSP External Evaluation Report 2005 - 31 - strategic plan. One of the lessons learned from the past program was to match projects addressing production with projects creating demand. The extensive list of achievements and benefits to both the U.S.A. and the host countries is an indication of the quality and commitment of scientists participating in the program. Technology transfer has been achieved through partnerships with multiple stakeholders. The Peanut CRSP has been very successful in expanding its budget, and in leveraging funds from other sources. However, progress in a number of projects has been limited by the amount of funds allocated. The program should ensure that the number of projects carried out does not fiscally prevent the effective conduct of the full portfolio.

Private health insurance companies registered in Uganda have been ordered to cover COVID-19. Isolation and treatment centres have been set up at Entebbe Grade B Hospital, Mulago National Specialist Hospital, and Adjumani and Hoima Hospitals, and are to accept any positive cases from lower-level/catchment healthcare facilities. Additional treatment capacity is provided by the private sector, but this option is only open to those with insurance or other financial means. Should more capacity become necessary, a temporary treatment centre has been envisaged in proximity to a military hospital, under the guidance of the Ugandan army.

C Hlpe ( high level panel of experts on food security and nutrition ) , 2012 .	Using the FIES at the individual level can capture disparities in food security between women and men, including those due to intra-household differences in resource allocation and feeding priorities. Preliminary results from 117 countriesk show that women are more likely to be food insecure than men in 26 per cent of countries, and men in 12 per cent of countries. In the remaining countries, women are as likely as men to be food insecure. The association between food insecurity and gender is more prevalent in developing countries. The proportion of developing countries where women are more likely than men to be food insecure increases to 39 per cent, while for men, it remains at about the same level, at 13 per cent. However, at the completion of data collection exercises in the countries implementing the scale, further analysis is needed to confirm the validity of a global experience-based insecurity scale and ensure cross-country comparability of results, including from a gender perspective. a A first draft of this box was prepared by the FAO Statistics Division.

Accordingly , special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities .	The IJMBS contributed to the understanding of how the logics of borders are confronted by migrant realities and everyday experiences. Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants' journeys. Being in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move. Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities. In particular, there has been a mounting pressure on the first countries of asylum to double efforts to locally integrate refugees they are hosting. However these countries struggle to meet the social and economic needs of refugees who often face discrimination. As described in an article, the desire to move on with their lives and escape the interminable temporariness in Turkey propelled some Syrian refugees to engage in secondary movements throughout the EU, despite the risks of the journey. For similar reasons, the vast majority of one million refugees who landed in Greece and Italy in 2015-2016, then engaged in secondary movements to escape the temporary status and the exploitative economies of transit. Another contribution shed light on the situation of asylum seekers confined in Indonesia and who hope to be resettled in Australia. It demonstrated that limbo in transit encouraged migrants to agree to assisted voluntary return, in many cases, to places where they may face persecution.	Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities.

"The European Review of International Migration (REMI) is a specialised journal on international migration and inter-ethnic relations. Multidisciplinary (sociology, anthropology, demography, geography, history, political science, etc.), it publishes in French, English and Spanish in-depth articles of empirical or theoretical orientation, as well as research notes that present the first results of ongoing research. Each review number includes a thematic issue which is supplemented by varia. A legal chronical since 2016 takes into account the growing importance of legal issues related to international migration and migration policy issues. This reborn chronical is moderated by a group of specialised lawyers who are developing a network around issues such as international migration law (conventions, protocols), reception and protection conditions for unaccompanied minors, protection and promotion of the social rights of migrants, human rights as protection of migrants' rights, access to health, labour law for irregular migrants. 25 Articles cited in the journal editors' contribution can be found at: https://journals.openedition.org/remi/. 339WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 REMI celebrated its 30th anniversary by publishing a special issue entitled ""Renewing the Migration Issues"" (32/3-4 2016).

On 28 April, Tumelo Mohlomi, a student from the University of Lesotho was killed when she was shot in the back of the head by a Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) officer while she was in a restaurant outside the campus. A police officer was arrested after the killing and apparently released on bail. The victim's family brought a civil case of murder against the LMPS, which sought an out-of-court settlement. The National Police Commissioner said that a criminal investigation into the case was ongoing. In August the High Court ruled in favour of a habeas corpus application brought by the family of Mokalekale Khetheng who disappeared on 26 March 2016 after arrest on unspecified charges by four LMPS officers in Leribe District. In August, the police officers were arrested in connection with his murder; Mokalekale Khetheng's body was exhumed. The former Minister of Defence was then arrested in connection with the murder. He and the officers were also charged with conspiracy to cause a disappearance. The former Minister was released on bail in September. The former National Police Commissioner, who remained abroad throughout the year, was apparently implicated in the case although he was not charged. On 5 September, Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) Commander Khoantle Motsomotso was shot dead in his office at the LDF headquarters in the capital, Maseru. Two suspects in the killing, LDF members Brigadier Bulane Sechele and Colonel Tefo Hashatsi, also died in retaliatory fire. The Prime Minister announced an investigation into the incident.

The number of countries not providing statutory cash benefits during maternity leave also dropped, from seven to two in 2013.59 Several countries took positive steps, shifting away from partial or complete reliance on employer liability or unpaid systems towards more collective systems of financing. These changes in financing sources differed somewhat by region. In Africa, an overall shift towards social security and mixed systems occurred as four countries moved away from dependence on employer liability systems alone: Angola (social insurance), Burundi (mixed), Mozambique (social insurance in 2009) and the United Republic of Tanzania (social security in 2005). In addition, three countries introduced paid leave: Namibia started a social insurance scheme in 1995; Swaziland, which pays two weeks of leave as of 1997 and Lesotho, which has progressively introduced compulsory paid leave for an increasing number of categories of workers as of 2009. Cote d'Ivoire changed from a system of mixed financing to a purely social security system.	These changes in financing sources differed somewhat by region.

For example, if a country grows cotton for export, the natural resources needed for production will not be calculated as part of its consumption Footprint. Rather, they are added to the consumption Footprint of the country importing and consuming T-shirts produced from the cotton.

It is critical to the food security of impoverished communities that do not produce enough lowland rice to meet their needs. In eastern India and Bangladesh, upland rice is grown by farmers who also have lowland fields, but who face a ""hungry month"" before lowland crops can be harvested; the upland crop, which is harvested early, bridges the family through a period when food is extremely scarce. In other areas such as the mountains of northern Lao PDR, many farm families have no lowland holdings and are heavily dependent on upland rice for subsistence. A commercial cropping system with an upland rice component has emerged only in the Brazilian Cerrado region and in northern China (see below)."

Twenty-three of the 50 economies that reformed in this area did so by simplifying preregistration or registration formalities. Such changes can vary from integrating multiple application forms into a single registration template to abolishing requirements for site inspections or bank certificates prior to company incorporation. By allowing voluntary value added tax registration at the time of business incorporation, Georgia reduced its relative gap to the best regulatory performance on starting a business the most in 2017/18. Previously, entrepreneurs had to make a separate visit to the Revenue Service for value added tax registration after company registration.

The findings of the systematic review were limited in scope, and did not directly compare alternative modalities for the delivery of pre-service education. Therefore, the GDG considered as a basis for the recommendation also the broader evidence emerging from the review of reviews and indirect evidence on health worker education, recognizing the limitations and caveats of applying it to CHWs as well. 7.4.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.4) addressing the question - ""For CHWs receiving pre-service training, should the curriculum use specific delivery modalities versus not?"" (81) - identified five eligible studies (one quantitative, four qualitative). Two studies were located in South Africa, two in the United States, and one in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro district: Nova Mambone Communities in Nova Mambone were resettled onto higher ground. Previously their livelihoods had consisted of farming, fishing, informal trading, handicrafts, brewing of traditional alcohol, wood cutting and charcoal making, working on the salt flats, and livestock (cattle). The women did the agricultural work, the trading, and the production of the traditional alcohol. Men worked on the salt flats, fished, and kept livestock. After the floods, the majority of the population received improved housing but had lost their livelihoods. Fishing activities have declined, and farming has been difficult due to the drought. Because of a lack of money in the economy, petty trading has not been revived. The families are mainly surviving on food for work projects two years after the floods. Women continue to try to farm. And some are beginning to keep chickens again. Some of the women said they had started a new business of selling meat from game hunted by the men. Men are unable to find work or alternative income sources so they work on the roads in the food for work programs; they no longer have boats or cattle, as they were lost in the floods. Box 10.4: Inhambane Province - Govuro District: Nova Mambone (continued) The positive aspects of the recovery process are that they live in areas that are more secure and people are less vulnerable to future flooding. There has been considerable investment in the economic, commercial and social infrastructure, and the road building has bought greater access to previously isolated areas.

Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization , and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

In this cluster a number of projects are utilizing or developing biotechnology tools to allow for improved efficiency of crop improvement ( gene-probes / markers and genetic manipulation ) to access and evaluate novel genes that have the potential to provide solutions to otherwise intractable problems .	Approaches: Production efficiency projects are based on scientific research approaches designed to increase production especially under conditions of low or minimized input use. In lesser-developed countries, technologies that exploit genetic resistances or avoidance mechanisms are most likely to impact on peanut production by resourcepoor farmers. These same approaches are the ones most likely to provide benefits to the U.S., where chemical inputs are a major cost and where lowering costs of production is an important requirement for the farmers to remain competitive. Increased efficiency of labor resource utilization will become a paramount issue as the ravages of the HIV epidemic impact labor resources in developing countries, and reduced use of pesticides will impact positively on environment preservation. In East/Southern Africa, collaboration with ICRISAT has guided the approach. ICRISAT has been developing varieties with early maturity and resistance to Groundnut Rosette Virus disease (GRV) and the Peanut CRSP has worked both upstream (evaluating variability) and downstream enabling the national programs to test and release adapted varieties. In this cluster a number of projects are utilizing or developing biotechnology tools to allow for improved efficiency of crop improvement (gene-probes/markers and genetic manipulation) to access and evaluate novel genes that have the potential to provide solutions to otherwise intractable problems. 2. Outputs/achievements: 2.1. Technical In many cases, projects have led to the development of improved technologies. These include improved germplasm and varieties, improved production practices, new techniques and interventions, and improvement of institutional and human resource capacity. 2.1.1 Genetic Improvement Improved varieties and useful germplasm have been released, developed or identified in a number of projects (UFL 16, TAM17, UGA28, NMX53): Disease resistant varieties in experimental plots in Ghana.

Japan has historically maintained burdensome application requirements for pesticide maximum residue level (MRL) approvals. The lengthy review process for registration of new pesticides and establishment of MRLs can delay the ability of U.S. growers to use newer and safer crop-protection products on crops to be shipped to Japan. In 2016, the first pesticide application was submitted under Japan's streamlined application process, which is intended to reduce the time, cost, and duplication of completing separate applications for pre-harvest and post-harvest uses of fungicides. The United States continues to work with Japan to improve the process. Japan's procedures for enforcement of MRLs result in uncertainty for shippers, including those who have never violated Japan's standards. After a single pesticide MRL violation, Japan imposes enhanced surveillance of all imports of the product on which the MRL violation was detected from that particular exporting country. If a second violation is found during the enhanced surveillance period, Japan will detain and test all shipments of that product from the exporting country, holding shipments until residue testing proves compliance. Japan has made significant progress in establishing science-based MRLs. The establishment of numerous permanent MRLs has resulted in fewer disruptions in trade. The United States continues to work with Japan and U.S. producers to support Japan's MRL establishment process and to address MRL-related concerns.

Migration before appification The world has changed fundamentally in the almost 70 years since the largest refugee crisis in Europe following the aftermath of World War II when the Refugee Convention was being developed.a Back then, there was no Internet, there were no mobiles or fax machines, and postal services were slow and often disrupted. Telegram and telephone communication was limited and costly. Paolina Roccanello arrived in Melbourne in April 1947 from Italy with her mother on the SS Misr in the shadow of the war.b They were lucky to be reunited with her father who had emigrated to Australia eight years before, expecting his family to follow soon after.

This is not to dismiss the important potential of export crops , but these have been discussed extensively elsewhere ( WorldBank 2012 ; 2015 ) .	This chapter discusses policy entry points to maximize agriculture's contribution. It begins with a brief profile of smallholder agriculture in Coted'Ivoire and the opportunities and challenges it presents for inclusive employment within agriculture, and also further down the chain. The focus is on features of the agricultural system that are important from a jobs perspective and agricultural subsectors that are particularly promising for inclusive employment, but that have so far received less attention in national employment strategies. This is not to dismiss the important potential of export crops, but these have been discussed extensively elsewhere (WorldBank 2012; 2015). Furthermore, many of the challenges faced by these crops, are also akin to those faced in the rice chains, which are discussed in more detail.53 The chapter concludes with five policy entry points.

This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across sectors, firm types, and over time. It also explores how the wage growth path is related to labor productivity and other firm-level characteristics. The analysis helps answer the following questions: (a) Are wages higher in large or small firms, firms creating jobs versus non-job creators? (b) Do wages increase with productivity, including productivity within firms and across sector? (c) How does this wage-productivity relationship vary by the extent of market competition? First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in wages across and within sectors, even after accounting for skill composition. Not surprisingly, most sectors pay better than agriculture. Somewhat unexpectedly, the food manufacturing sector has one of the lowest average wage. The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23) are by far the highest-paying sectors. Those in the public sector (75) are also among the highest-paying jobs, lending support to the argument that in many developing countries including Coted'Ivoire, high public wages might impose a wage floor effect for skilled workers in the private sector. This observation is consistent with the finding in Chapter1 that for the more educated --those at least upper-secondary education --public jobs are more prevalent that private wage employment in the formal sector.

Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010.

The active involvement of extension workers and beneficiaries brought about a new dimension to training and technology transfer activities. The outputs went beyond research reports and papers. The project facilitated the production of extension materials such as brochures, leaflets, and posters, and the development of a Peanut CRSP website at KAPI in Kasetsart University, for general public access to peanut technology and training information.

"Brazil remained on the Special 301 Watch List in 2018. Brazil is an increasingly important market for intellectual property (IP) intensive industries; however, administrative and enforcement challenges continue, including high levels of counterfeiting and piracy online and in physical markets. Increased emphasis on enforcement at the tri-border region between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and stronger deterrent penalties, are critical to make sustained progress on these IP concerns. The National Council on Combating Piracy and Intellectual Property Crimes (CNCP) was an effective entity for carrying out public awareness and enforcement campaigns, although in recent years it has not delivered the same kinds of achievements. Positive developments at the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) include the hiring of new examiners, additional funding, reduced patent and trademark backlogs, and streamlined procedures for certain reviews, including those pursuant to the 2016 Patent Prosecution Highway pilot program, originally limited in Brazil to oil and gas industry applications and expanded in 2018 to encompass information technologies. Concerns remain about delays in the review of patent and trademark applications. To resolve concerns about duplicative reviews by Brazil's National Sanitary Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) of pharmaceutical patent applications presented before INPI, an April 2017 agreement between INPI and ANVISA redefined ANVISA's role in order to expedite the examination of such applications. The United States will monitor implementation of this agreement. Furthermore, while Brazilian law and regulations provide for protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test results and other data generated to obtain marketing approval for veterinary and agricultural chemical products, similar protection is not provided for pharmaceutical products. The United States also remains concerned about INPI's actions to invalidate or shorten the term of a significant number of ""mailbox"" patents for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products.

This means that in addition to increasing education expenditure , more must be done to ensure that these resources will effectively improve education outcomes - - in particular , learning .	While the level of financing is certainly critical for the education sector, it is not a good predictor of education results when considered in isolation. For instance, research findings indicate that there is low correlation between government spending and the performance of the education system.10 Indeed, with similar levels of government expenditure per child, some DCPs have achieved universal primary education, while others remain far from this target. This means that in addition to increasing education expenditure, more must be done to ensure that these resources will effectively improve education outcomes--in particular, learning. 3.2. Improving efficiency in primary education Indicator 13 GPE tracks efficiency in primary education through measuring the impact of repetition and dropout on the resources dedicated to the primary education cycle (Indicator 13). The internal efficiency coefficient (IEC)11 allows estimation of the proportion of the resources that are used for repetition and dropout, which inform the inefficiencies of the system. The indicator calculates the proportion of countries that have an IEC higher or equal to 70 percent, meaning that 30 percent or less of their resources are used for repetition and dropout. However, the lack of data is an impediment to a comprehensive assessment across DCPs. Data since 2010 for Indicator 13 are only available for 25 DCPs, and only six have data for the period 2015-2018, so there are not enough updates to enable reporting against the milestone for this indicator.12 But across the 25 DCPs with available data, the IEC at the primary level sits at 63 percent (59 percent for the 17 FCACs with data). This means that 37 percent of all education spending was used to cover the costs of repetition and dropout in these countries.	This means that in addition to increasing education expenditure, more must be done to ensure that these resources will effectively improve education outcomes--in particular, learning.

Sharing information internationally in order to prevent new invasions is possibly the single most important area for improved international scientific cooperation .	In general, the most cost-effective way of dealing with IAS is to prevent them from entering a new ecosystem (or, more typically, a new country), or failing that, to eradicate them before they can become established in a new location. Sharing information internationally in order to prevent new invasions is possibly the single most important area for improved international scientific cooperation. The mechanisms for increasing this cooperation are many and diverse. Several bodies are attempting (or have attempted) to create massive regional or global IAS databases (see list in Wittenberg & Cock, 2001). If properly maintained and networked, such databases would enable rapid access to information that could inform a wide range of stakeholders. Another popular approach is to create international networks of experts and then to use Internet appeals to solicit information on particular species. The invasive Species Specialist Group (Issg) of the World Conservation Union s (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) is one such network (Issg@auckland.ac.nz). However, membership in the ISSG is by invitation only.

Practice Although there is limited availability of data within the nursing profession across South America, authorized practice seems to vary depending on nurse type. In Argentina, nurses and licensed nurses both have prescriptive authority and may prescribe any medications. However, neither may refer patients for additional care, nor may they diagnose patients. In Peru, a nurse has a duty to administer healthcare in an emergent situation and, because of this, nurse specialists and general nurses may prescribe medication or refer patients for additional medical care. Both nurse types may diagnose patients. Ancestral midwives in Ecuador may refer patients for additional medical care, diagnose patients, and prescribe medicinal plants and natural remedies. In Brazil, nurses and advanced or specialized nurses possess authority to offer a nursing diagnosis. In addition, these types of nurses may prescribe medications according to protocols, clinical and therapeutic guidelines, or other technical regulations established by the federal, state, or municipal authorities. These protocols and guidelines are subject to the legal provisions of the profession.

Participation in primary education is nearly universal Between 1990 and 2012 , primary education was extended to an ever increasing proportion of the world 's children .	Participation in primary education is nearly universal Between 1990 and 2012, primary education was extended to an ever increasing proportion of the world's children. Over that period, substantial progress was made towards universal primary education, with the global adjusted net enrolment rate7 in primary education rising from 77 to 90 per cent for girls and from 87 to 92 per cent for boys (figure 3.2). The enrolment of girls in primary education has increased faster than that of boys, which helped to close the gender gap at the primary level. This is particularly true in those regions where girls' enrolment rates were historically much lower than that of boys. Outstanding gains in primary enrolment have been registered in developing regions, particularly in Northern and sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Asia and Oceania. This is largely due to increased investment in primary education and measures taken such as the abolishment of school fees. However, many countries in some of these regions are still far from attaining universal primary education. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite an impressive increase of 27 and 22 percentage points for girls and boys, respectively, over the period 1990-2012, only 75 per cent of primaryschool-aged girls and 81 per cent of boys of the same age attended school in 2012. In developed 7 The adjusted net enrolment rate is the percentage of children of official primary school age who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education.

The catalyst of the recent move towards independence from the executive was a case brought by over 400 judicial officers in 1995 requesting a ruling on the question of separation of the judiciary from the executive.52 The High Court heard the case in 1997 and gave what is now a historic judgment comprising 12 directives relating to separation of the judiciary.

"El Salvador requires a ""Certificate of Free-Sale"" to register food products. The Ministry of Health has agreed to accept the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) 9060-5 certificate for meat and meat products in lieu of the Certificate of Free-Sale. However, the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) requires an original FSIS 9060-5 certificate (health certificate) for U.S. meat and meat products. Obtaining a health certificate for the purpose of food product registration is problematic as this document only accompanies actual shipments of meat or processed meat products. These shipments cannot occur until the food product is registered. Under the CAFTA-DR, El Salvador granted equivalence to the U.S. sanitary inspection system for beef, pork, and poultry and poultry products, making this requirement unnecessarily burdensome to U.S. exports. In 2015, El Salvador issued the implementing regulation for the Act for the Promotion, Protection and Support of Breast Feeding, which defines requirements for sanitary registration, restricts marketing and advertising, and sets out labeling requirements for breast milk substitutes. This measure was published and entered into force in 2015, without notification to the WTO, and lacks clarity as to what information must appear on the label. At least one U.S. company doing business in El Salvador has expressed concerns about the measure. The United States is monitoring the implementation of the measure and has requested El Salvador notify it to the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade Committee to allow WTO Members a comment period and reasonable interval for implementation."

Program content assured that the Title XII expectations of impact in the host (developing) countries with benefits to the United States (U.S.A.) would be achieved. Plans were developed to resolve major constraints to the host countries and U.S.A. peanut sector and to ensure that social and gender issues were addressed.

A substantial number of experiments have been conducted in recent years, providing evidence of both successes and failures of management training interventions. Some patterns emerge from a systematic review of the available evidence. To be successful, management training must be kept simple, appropriate teaching materials must be available, and the training must such as numeracy and literacy, as well as social skills. A vast literature highlights the importance of entrepreneurs' schooling as a determinant of firm growth, employment, and efficiency.74 Russian and Chinese business owners have more entrepreneurs in their families and among childhood friends than otherwise similar individuals, suggesting that social environment also matters.75 Learning can also happen through jobs.

Strong variations are also observed in average worker productivity by sector (Figure1.14, WorldBank,2015). Agriculture and commerce occupy three-fourths of the population, yet these activities are also the least productive. Average earnings are estimated at CFAF 39,612 per month in agriculture, and CFAF 52,125 per month in commerce. Sectors with the highest earnings are also those with the smallest employment shares. For instance, the finance or extractive industry sectors have average earnings of 2.3, respectively CFAF 1.6 million per month.

"In a poor neighborhood of Santiago de los Caballeros, the second-largest city in the Dominican Republic, only a few women sold clothes and sweets in the streets a decade ago. Many are now earning incomes from activities such as selling lottery tickets or running small clothing stores and beauty salons. The incomes of these women are vitally important to their families because men are struggling. Factory opportunities and other jobs associated with the city's free trade zone have been shrinking in recent years. Participants in a Santiago focus group said that women found work BOX 1.2 Jobs bring earnings opportunities to women, but also new difficulties more easily than men because employers have ""more confidence in them [the women]."" Increased labor force participation is not without challenges. The women in Santiago worry about their safety because of assaults, theft, and gang violence; many think it is too dangerous to work at night. Despite the expansion of work opportunities, mobility continues to be a constraint not only because of poor transportation and safety risks but also because of the roles women play as incomeearners and as caregivers in the household. In rural areas, women face difficulties in traveling for farm work and other jobs outside their villages because of traditional cultural and gender norms."

If a boom is under way, the development payoff of new manufacturing jobs Ensuring that rights and standards are upheld requires a focus not only on implementing acquired rights but also on expanding their reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of formal laws and regulations. Associations of informal workers can play a key role in informing them, helping them access legal mechanisms, and offering them collective voice. But often, information alone is not enough: garment workers in the Lao People's Democratic Republic reported that they were told about their basic conditions of employment, but they did not always understand the details, nor how to enforce their rights.46 Not only can organizations of informal workers support workers in learning about and accessing rights and standards, but they can also bring cases to court on behalf of individuals and groups.47 The quality of institutions for accountability affects the extent to which labor rights are enforced in practice.48 Because court proceedings are often lengthy and costly, alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes, including conciliation, mediation, and arbitration prior to court hearings can expand access to justice and grievance redress.49 These alternative mechanisms are especially valuable to workers who cannot access the court system due to high costs or other barriers.

Also , enumerators sought to interview the member of the household with the most knowledge of rice farming practices , if he or she was not available ( and would not be available during the time spent in the village ) , then enumerators asked questions of other household members to gauge if they had suitable knowledge of household farming practices .	In each village 30 randomly selected households were sampled; a random start point was selected using high resolution satellite imagery in Google Earth and from this start point enumerators sampled rice farming households along a random walk. If a household was not able to respond when the enumerator visited then a time was arranged for a revisit. Also, enumerators sought to interview the member of the household with the most knowledge of rice farming practices, if he or she was not available (and would not be available during the time spent in the village), then enumerators asked questions of other household members to gauge if they had suitable knowledge of household farming practices. The timing of the questionnaire (October to December 2014) was designed to overlap with the harvest period; this minimised the possibility that key household members would be absent (e.g. seasonal migration). No households, which cultivate rice, had to be skipped or classified as non-respondent due to absence from the village. In total 300 households were sampled exceeding the sample size required to maintain a 10% margin of error at a 95% confidence level accounting for a design effect of two and a 10% no-response rate.

In the patrilineal landowning communities with settled agriculture which are prevalent in the Asian region , the economic obligations of sons towards parents are greater .	"In almost all regions, the practice is rooted in culture and the economics of son preference, these factors playing a major role in the low valuation and neglect of female children. The practice of son preference emerged with the shift from subsistence agriculture, which was primarily controlled by women, to settled agriculture, which is primarily controlled by men. In the patrilineal landowning communities with settled agriculture which are prevalent in the Asian region, the economic obligations of sons towards parents are greater. The son is considered to be the family pillar, who ensures continuity and protection of the family property. Sons provide the workforce and have to bring in a bride-""an extra pair of hands"". Sons are the source of family income and have to provide for parents in their old age. They are also the interpreters of religious teachings and the performers of rituals, especially on the death of parents, which include feeding a large number of people, sometimes several villages. As soldiers, sons protect the community and hold political power."

Strong productivity growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversified the cash crop mix, but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products. The expansion of rice, cotton, and cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective (Figure7). Rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. Cotton and cashew producers make most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive employment. An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Vegetable production is also highly labor intensive, but its potential has so far not been fully exploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but scope for improvement remains.

First, given the forecasted growth in T&T in the coming decade, far more investment is required in infrastructure in order to build capacity to welcome more visitors while adequately serving the needs of citizens. For example, despite the growth in air travel and openness, global average perceptions of air transport infrastructure quality have improved at a far slower rate (at a global average 1.4% and 0.4% for high-income economies since the last report), and airport density statistics have fallen. In addition, while some progress has been made in improving ground and port infrastructure, especially in Asia-Pacific, the overall growth trend for Ground and Port Infrastructure (pillar 11) has been slower. Furthermore, from a global perspective, perceptions of the quality and efficiency of ground transport infrastructure and services have on average remained near stagnant.

Savings typically decline among older age groups. This decline could be offset if young people were to build up additional buffers to support their longer life spans, especially if public retirement schemes prove unsustainable or are absent.

The privatization of the governmentmanaged rice commodity chain has also allowed the emergence and fast growth of small-scale processing units in place of parastatal industrial mills. This has resulted in decreasing rice processing costs, thus improving the overall competitiveness of the local rice vis-a-vis imported rice. But this change has also led to a degradation of average local rice quality, which is becoming quite variable. Consumers now favor lowerquality imported rice, which does not have the same organoleptic attributes as local rice, but which is cleaner and more homogeneous in appearance, thus requiring less time for preparation.

In areas with sufficient rainfall, upland rice may be followed by a crop of maize, cowpea, beans, soybean, or sweet potato. In West Africa, one or more crops may be mixed with upland rice. Farmers use an area for 1-3 yr until soil fertility declines and weed and pest infestations increase. They then abandon the land and return to previously abandoned farmland or start cropping on other available fallow land. In traditional shifting cultivation systems, fallow periods were as long as 30 years. This lengthy fallow restored fertility and prevented weed seed buildup. Now, rotations in most upland areas practicing shifting cultivation have shortened to a 2-or 3-yr cycle because of increased population pressure. This has resulted in increased weed pressure and reduced soil fertility.	In areas with sufficient rainfall, upland rice may be followed by a crop of maize, cowpea, beans, soybean, or sweet potato.

The privatization of the governmentmanaged rice commodity chain has also allowed the emergence and fast growth of small-scale processing units in place of parastatal industrial mills. This has resulted in decreasing rice processing costs, thus improving the overall competitiveness of the local rice vis-a-vis imported rice. But this change has also led to a degradation of average local rice quality, which is becoming quite variable. Consumers now favor lowerquality imported rice, which does not have the same organoleptic attributes as local rice, but which is cleaner and more homogeneous in appearance, thus requiring less time for preparation. The future of the West African rice economy depends highly on the improvement of supply-to-demand linkages.

There are , however , many marine areas where the customary laws of indigenous peoples are recognised and respected by the broader society .	Note that governance types describe the different types of management authority and responsibility that can exist for protected areas but do not necessarily relate to ownership. In some of the governance types - e.g., state and private protected areas - governance and ownership will often be the same. However in other cases this will depend on individual country legislation: for example many indigenous peoples' protected areas and community conserved areas are found on state-owned land. In large and complex protected areas, particularly in categories V and VI, there may be multiple governance types within the boundaries of one protected area, possibly under the umbrella of an overview authority. In the case of most marine protected areas the ownership can be with the state, which will either manage directly or delegate management to communities, NGOs or others. There are, however, many marine areas where the customary laws of indigenous peoples are recognised and respected by the broader society.

As urban and rural wages increase, pressures to mechanize will increase. This does not necessarily imply large-scale farming. Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization. They have been deployed successfully, most recently also in China, where land endowments are multiple times smaller.69 While not acute, the need for supporting smallholder mechanization within Coted'Ivoire and its implications for employment generation in agriculture deserves further investigation. 66 The 2011-2016 regional US$44 million West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), which Coted'Ivoire participates in and which is thefirst phase of a 10-year program, provides an initial step in addressing the staple crop productivity gap. The program focused on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops (plantain, rice, manioc, rice, maize, mango) and animal husbandry (chicken, pork). Regional research centers were set up, each focusing on one crop. The center in Coted'Ivoire focused on plantain. 67 WorldBank (2012a, 2014) provides a useful starting point. 68 Deininger et al.

As indicated in the analysis in Chapter1 , Coted'Ivoire 's main employment challenge stems from the concentration of employment in informal and low-productivity occupations .	Given the higher-quality of jobs in the modern formal sector, expanding the size of the formal sector is key to more and better jobs. As indicated in the analysis in Chapter1, Coted'Ivoire's main employment challenge stems from the concentration of employment in informal and low-productivity occupations. An analysis of the employment profile illustrates a very low share of wage employment among the employed population. In particular, less than 4 percent of the employed population holds formal private wage jobs. In this context, it is essential to better understand the dynamics of employment in formal enterprises, and the constraints to the creation of formal jobs. This is also particularly relevant as the formal sector constitutes a large share of aggregate value added in the economy.

Migration of workers Precise figures on the global number of international migrants are not available, an unsurprising fact given that a number of them cross borders illegally or do not return once their visas and permits expire. That is why estimates tend to rely on population censuses and household surveys.

PROMER helped to create 240 enterprises, consolidate 665 enterprises, create 3,750 jobs, and teach 458 people to read. It usually takes enterprises 3 to 5 years to reach their full potential, and finding a niche in the economy can be critical for success. Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries. Apprentices trained informally by the baker opened 20 enterprises of their own and created about 84 jobs. Other rural enterprises were not as successful. Some developed products that succeeded in rural markets but not in urban markets because of high transport costs, poor marketing, or poor quality. Most entrepreneurs reported challenges in maintaining quality and continuous production. Rural enterprises had trouble finding an urban location in which to present their products, a result that highlights the problem of multiple constraints.

"Carbon Footprint the biologically productive land area which is required for the uptake of the carbon dioxide (which is not absorbed by the oceans). The supply of the corresponding biocapacity (forest set aside for carbon uptake) is, however, currently too small to absorb the entire quantity of CO2 generated by humans.

International trade , travel , tourism , and transport - The 4 Ts - are the major drivers of biological invasion ( McNeely et al ., 2001 ) .	"International trade, travel, tourism, and transport - The 4 Ts - are the major drivers of biological invasion (McNeely et al., 2001). Every country contributes to the problem: some request goods and services from afar, while others supply products to meet these demands. ""More Faster Further"" have become the slogans of economic growth. In 2001, world import and export markets were valued at US$6270 billion and US$6155 billion, respectively (World Trade Organization, 2002). People also increasingly travel the world for business and pleasure. Commercial services (including travel, transport, and other services) totalled US$1443 billion in imports and US$1458 billion in exports worldwide in 2001 (World Trade Organization, 2002). Despite good intentions, developed countries occasionally facilitate the introduction of IAS to other countries through development assistance programs, military operations, famine relief projects, and international financing (McNeely et al., 2001, Reaser et al., 2003). Land-use and climate change can also facilitate invasion by making habitats more challenging for native species and more hospitable to IAS (Mooney & Hobbs, 2001). Because disturbed habitats often favor rapid colonizers, they are particularly vulnerable to the invasion of alien species (Mooney & Hobbs, 2000). From the perspective of the IAS, it does not matter whether the environmental changes are natural or human induced."

Fortunately, it appears that he will be able to return to the US on another J-1 visa to the end of the project. The refractory nature of aflatoxin in foods is also a challenge.

"If this leads to a difficult balancing act, you can imagine how things go when the number of available planet-cloths is reduced. activity: loop game This game is similar to the Chair Metaphor game. Rope loops of varying sizes are laid down. As long as there is singing or music playing, everyone must keep moving. When the music stops, both feet must be within a loop. As in ""musical chairs"", whoever doesn't find a place is eliminated. During the course of the game, more and more loops are taken away and the chance of finding a spot thus becomes slimmer and slimmer. Besides the active participants, there can be a group of neutral observers who watch the reactions to the shrinking numbers of loops (shrinking resources), note them down, and report them back to the group later.

In India, the authorities were openly critical of human rights defenders, contributing to a climate of hostility and violence against them. Repressive laws were used to stifle freedom of expression, and journalists and press freedom came under increasing attack. Human rights defenders in Afghanistan faced constant threats to their life and security from armed groupsand state actors, and journalists faced violence and censorship. Pakistan authorities failed to protect journalists, bloggers, and civil society and activists whofaced constant harassment, intimidation, threats, smear campaigns and attacks from non-state actors. Instead, the authorities increased restrictions on the work of scores of NGOs, and subjected many activists to attacks, including torture and enforced disappearances. In Bangladesh, the government intensified its crackdown on public debate and criticism. Media workers were harassed and prosecuted under draconian laws. The government failed to hold accountable armed groups that carried out a high-profile spate of killings of secular bloggers. Activists regularly received death threats, forcing some to leave the country. In Maldives, restrictions on public debate intensified. The authorities harassed journalists, activists and media outlets. The government was apparently behind a relentless assault on the rule of law that compromised the judiciary's independence.

Rice, environmental degradation, and sustainable intensification In highly populated areas of West Africa, rising cropping intensity in fragile upland ecosystems has already begun to degrade the resource base, with environmental damage and loss in production potential. Rice has a key role to play in providing options for sustainable intensification. Rice is uniquely well adapted to flooded lowland ecosystems where the soils are least fragile and best able to support continuous cultivation. The development of profitable lowland rice technologies is therefore a central element in strategies to induce farmers to reduce pressure on rapidly degraded uplands by shifting cultivation to lowland ecosystems. Relative to other cereals, rice also responds more to improved management and to higher inputs of nutrients, water control, and labor, and is thus favored as production systems intensify.

"Warda is an autonomous Intergovernmental Research Association of 17 countries in West and Central Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. WARDA was founded in 1970. Since 1986, WARDA has also been a member of the CGIAR. WARDA's mission is ""to contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in poor rural and urban populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, through research, partnerships, capacity strengthening, and policy support on rice-based systems, and in ways that promote sustainable agricultural development based on environmentally sound management of natural resources."" Rice is a unique and highly political commodity in Africa. Because of its ease of preparation, low preparation costs, low price, and steady supplies (through imports), rice consumption is increasing rapidly, providing food security for Africa's poor. Because of its large genetic diversity, it tolerates extreme soil and weather conditions, allowing farmers to produce food in adverse environments. Rice is also an integrating crop. Rice development often acts as an entry point for the development of the agricultural sector as a whole by enhancing household food security, reducing production risk, enhancing income, and averting natural resource degradation. WARDA will therefore seek to contribute to poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa through integrated sustainable development of the rice sector, particularly through technology development. WARDA's ultimate beneficiaries are rice producers and consumers in West and Central Africa. WARDA's more immediate beneficiaries are its research and development collaborators, such as national agricultural research and extension systems and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)."

But many challenges and opportunities for production , yield and jobs growth remain through interventions on the farm , but also down the chain .	Despite rapid growth in rice production and yields recorded in the national statistics, many challenges and opportunities for growth remain both among producers and further down the value chain. As indicated in Figures 3.4 and 3.9, following a long period of stagnation, national statistics have recorded a very rapid gain in rice production in Coted'Ivoire since 2009. These gains are largely achieved through gains in yields. But many challenges and opportunities for production, yield and jobs growth remain through interventions on the farm, but also down the chain. Poor organization of marketing and processing of paddy rice was for example recognized by the NRDS as one of the key challenges to boost production, thereby for thefirst time explicitly linking the challenge of increasing yields with the challenge of improving performance along the whole chain. It identified (a) the lack of confirmed and regular buyers, (b) the high costs of collection and transport (undermining import competitiveness), (c) the non-remunerative prices for producers, the absence of a price guarantee mechanism, and the failure of buyers to observe contract terms, (d) an inefficient paddy-processing sector, and (e) lack of storage facilities as important constraints to boost import competitiveness and domestic production.	But many challenges and opportunities for production, yield and jobs growth remain through interventions on the farm, but also down the chain.

The basic structure for schooling is comprised of eight years of elementary education ; five years of lower elementary ( Standards I to V ) , three years of higher elementary ( Standards VI to VIII ) .	Country Notes The common education structure at the school level follows the pattern of '10 + 2'; ten years of basic education, followed by two years of upper secondary school. Classes and grade levels have different names depending on the state in which instruction takes place. Terminology for school leaving examinations can be confusing as it also varies. The basic structure for schooling is comprised of eight years of elementary education; five years of lower elementary (Standards I to V), three years of higher elementary (Standards VI to VIII). This is followed by two years of secondary education (Standards IX and X). At the end of ten years of schooling a Secondary School Certificate is awarded upon passing the examinations set by the relevant State or Central Board of Secondary Education. Students who wish to continue for higher studies must complete a two-year higher secondary program (Standards XI and XII), choosing science, humanities or vocational streams, which culminates in the Higher Secondary Certificate or Standard XII examination certificate. This certificate is the minimum requirement for admission to degree programs at Indian universities. It should be noted that a variety of names exist for the final examinations of this level of education.	The basic structure for schooling is comprised of eight years of elementary education; five years of lower elementary (Standards I to V), three years of higher elementary (Standards VI to VIII).

The network began as a response to the need to collaborate and coordinate research on rice in view of its increasing cultivation and consumption in Europe. Some of the important subjects are quality and competitiveness of European rice; resistance to blast, stem borers, and diseases; control of red rice, a weed that competes with cultivated rice; cataloguing of rice genetic resources in the region; and a databank of knowledge on all aspects of rice cultivation for the purpose of improved management and rice yields. These are all being investigated through cooperative research programs among member institutions of the network.	The network began as a response to the need to collaborate and coordinate research on rice in view of its increasing cultivation and consumption in Europe.

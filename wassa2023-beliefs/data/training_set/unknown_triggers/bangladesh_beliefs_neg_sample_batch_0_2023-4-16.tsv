Unsafe drinking water , poor hygiene practices and inadequate health services contribute to a cycle where the well-being of the most vulnerable is compromised .	For 2020, UN agencies and humanitarian partners are requesting approximately $107 million to target an estimated 5.5 million people with humanitarian assistance. Food security, agriculture and nutrition will remain key response priorities due to low agricultural production and increasingly frequent dry spells and floods. Unsafe drinking water, poor hygiene practices and inadequate health services contribute to a cycle where the well-being of the most vulnerable is compromised. Therefore, humanitarian interventions will continue to focus on a multisector response to address the multiple drivers of humanitarian needs in the country. The plan will continue to focus on women and children, in particular children under age 5 and pregnant and lactating women, who represent 32 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, of the total number of people targeted.

For decades , the international system has had standards and institutions to facilitate cooperation and the maintenance of order on issues of finance and trade , arms control and refugees , and many other issues .	"United Nations Member States crafted the Global Compact for Migration with an eye to the long term, but it already has one accomplishment to its credit: it has brought one of the last outstanding global issues into the United Nations in a formal, negotiated manner. For decades, the international system has had standards and institutions to facilitate cooperation and the maintenance of order on issues of finance and trade, arms control and refugees, and many other issues. More recently, it has developed a framework for dealing with climate change. But international migration remained a patchwork of unilateral, bilateral and regional policies, long considered too divisive for general debate within the United Nations as a stand-alone issue beyond its interrelationship with development. With the Global Compact for Migration, a framework of common expectations and obligations has at long last emerged. 72 GMG, N.D.; United Nations Network on Migration, 2018. 73 see the terms of references: UNDP, Multi-Partner Trust Fund office, 2019. 74 United Nations network on migration, 2018. 309WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2020 The very first draft of the Global Compact for Migration identified a ""coherent UN system"" as necessary for effective implementation. As mentioned, the Compact welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to replace the Global Migration Group of United Nations agencies, with a United Nations Migration Network with clearer and consistent leadership from IOM and a small group of United Nations entities that have movement of people as an important part of their mandate or capacities. The agreement that brought IOM into the United Nations system as a related organization in 2016 gives the United Nations system unprecedented capacity to help its members address migration issues. The United Nations has also strengthened its capacity by establishing the Network on Migration. With this structure in place as of December 2018, the United Nations system should be positioned to offer coherent and comprehensive support to States as they set about implementing their commitments to safe, orderly and regular migration."

Brazil : Over 90 men killed in Brazilian prison riots ( Amr 19/5444 / 2017 ) .	Juvenile detention facilities remained overcrowded and detainees suffered inhuman and degrading conditions. In Ceara state, torture by state officials was recurrent inside juvenile detention facilities. During the year, there were at least 20 riots and 37 escapes from units in Ceara. Out of 200 formal reports of torture of adolescents inside juvenile detention units in Ceara between 2016 and September 2017, only two reports resulted in a formal inquiry by the state for further investigation. Reports of the chaotic state of the juvenile justice system in Ceara resulted in a formal visit by Brazil's National Human Rights Council in September. Early in the year, Espirito Santo state held 1,198 juvenile detainees in a system with capacity for only 754, a rate of overcrowding of more than 39%. Of the state's 13 detention facilities, only four were operating within their intended capacity. On 3 June, seven boys aged between 15 and 17 were killed by other teenage detainees during a riot in a juvenile detention facility in Lagoa Seca, Paraiba state. On 13 November, four young boys were killed by hooded men who entered a juvenile justice system facility where the boys were detained. 1.

"A new tool under development for the work is the ""microarray,"" in which about 20,000 genes can be displayed at once on a ""chip,"" which can then be used as a sensor to detect genetic messages that are turned on or off when plants are exposed to stress. Thus, the expression of the genes can be recorded and analyzed to give a total picture of how the plant behaves in different conditions. In this way, scientists will be able to identify hundreds or perhaps thousands of genes that may combine and interact to achieve a particular function, such as tolerating drought, resisting disease, or producing more nutritious grains.

Both these labor supply and demand side perspectives on the role of agriculture would suggest that increasing labor productivity during the structural transformation should mainly happen through a reduction of the agricultural labor force and that to do so, policies should especially focus on removing barriers to sectoral (and spatial) migration. Yet, even though popular, there are a number of important caveats to these perspectives. For example, recent evidence indicates that the frequently cited agricultural productivity gap measures based on the national accounts abstract from a series of confounding factors and measurement issues, which exaggerate the gap. This suggests that the gains from sectoral movements, and thus the incentives to move, may not be as large as commonly purported. Furthermore, the view that labor is less productive in agriculture --a viewpoint that is especially well established in macro policy circles --has often also been taken as evidence that labor in agriculture is intrinsically less productive, and thus less worthy of investment. This sits oddly with the agricultural success stories of agro-exporters such as the United States and the Netherlands, and more recently also Vietnam, Chile, and Peru.

The expansion of rice , cotton , and cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective ( Figure7 ) .	Strong productivity growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversified the cash crop mix, but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products. The expansion of rice, cotton, and cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective (Figure7). Rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. Cotton and cashew producers make most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive employment. An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Vegetable production is also highly labor intensive, but its potential has so far not been fully exploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but scope for improvement remains.

Develop ideas , approaches , and rules which could lead to such a situation ?	What consequences can this have?

South Korea recently acquired 689,000 * ha of land in Sudan. The United Arab Emirates has reserved 400,000 ha in the same country. Libya is growing wheat in Mali.

Articles provide empirical researches describing the use of care and therapeutic relationships in mental health for migrants at different points in their migration route. The mental health perspective renews the reading of the social relationships in which the migrant is inserted. It also makes it possible to analyse the social conditions of production, expression and management of psychological suffering at the micro, meso and macro-social levels. The methods of care (institutional, social, legal, health) for migrants diagnosed ""as having mental disorders, psychological difficulties or in a state of suffering"" link the effects of migration policies, the dynamics of reception and care of migrants, the organisation of care systems and the production of subjectivities and self-expression. 341world Migration Report 2020 Chapter 6 ."

Partnership with national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) The goal of WARDA's partnership with national systems is to achieve the most cost-effective means of developing and transferring new rice technologies within the region as a whole. WARDA views the regional rice science infrastructure as an integrated and interdependent system. Because agroecological environments cut across political boundaries, technologies developed in any single location are usually transferable to far broader areas. The objectives of WARDA's partnership with NARES are to achieve a more complementary and efficient sharing of research tasks by allocating responsibilities on the basis of comparative advantage, and to maximize research spillover between these systems and WARDA, and among the national systems themselves.

Quality of primary education in Coted'Ivoire also lags behind other Sub-Saharan African countries, limiting the skills that children can acquire in school. For instance, students at CM2 level (fifth grade of primary school) are behind relative to other Francophone countries in the region (Figure10). Math scores are particularly low and less than 25 percent meet minimum competence requirements. French scores are more comparable to the average level obtained in other countries but still less than 45 percent are meeting minimum requirements. Since the education system constitutes the main source of skills acquisition for most individuals, continued improvements in access to education, as well as rapid gains in learning through improvements in the quality of education services will be critical for Coted'Ivoire's competiveness.

It is vital because exporters wish to be paid when goods are shipped while importers do not want to pay before they receive the merchandise. This can be a major problem in view of the fact that cargos from Europe to Asia may take up to 80 days. Financial institutions can help to bridge the gap between importers and exporters by providing payment solutions while taking the credit risk. Very little international trade is actually paid as cash in advance. The trade finance market is therefore sizable as the vast majority of the US$ 23 trillion worth of goods require a loan, payment guarantee or credit insurance to cross borders.

They are the cornerstones of virtually all national and international conservation strategies, set aside to maintain functioning natural ecosystems, to act as refuges for species and to maintain ecological processes that cannot survive in most intensely managed landscapes and seascapes. Protected areas act as benchmarks against which we understand human interactions with the natural world. Today they are often the only hope we have of stopping many threatened or endemic species from becoming extinct. They are complementary to measures to achieve conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity outside protected areas in accordance with CBD guidelines such as the Malawi and Addis Ababa Principles (CBD VII/11-12). Most protected areas exist in natural or near-natural ecosystems, or are being restored to such a state, although there are exceptions. Many contain major features of earth history and earth processes while others document the subtle interplay between human activity and nature in cultural landscapes. Larger and more natural protected areas also provide space for evolution and future ecological adaptation and restoration, both increasingly important under conditions of rapid climate change.

The pitfalls of skills building The importance of skills cannot be overstated (box 5.7). But caution is needed before jumping from this recognition to the launching of large skills-building programs. The root cause of skill shortages or mismatches might not lie with the education and training system. Shortages and mismatches may instead result from wrong signals generated by market distortions and institutional failures elsewhere in the economy. If a civil service career pays overly well, young people may study to obtain such jobs, even if they need to queue for them. This can Skills or jobs--which comes first?

The third aspect of migration and health is how health-care systems respond to migration and health. The health-care system is itself a determinant of health and, depending on the policies and legal frameworks of individual States, migrants may not be granted adequate, equitable and affordable access to health services, and/or local health systems may not have sufficient capacity to manage migrant health needs. For example, in countries of protracted crisis, migrant children fleeing conflict settings and seeking asylum with their families are more likely to have not met their vaccination targets due to disruptions in health-care delivery in countries of origin. Where health services are available, certain migrant groups may find it difficult to express symptomology and understand treatment instructions due to language barriers. Different cultural constructs of illness causation, such as those concerning mental health, challenge effective clinical management.22 They may also have difficulty with navigating unfamiliar health and welfare systems - especially when coming from countries with severely disrupted health systems.

"Branding, Labeling, and Packaging Consumers are concerned with both the product itself and the product's secondary features, such as packaging, warranties, and services. Branding and labeling products in foreign markets raise new considerations for your company, such as: * Are international brand names important to promote and distinguish a product? Conversely, should local brands or private labels be used to heighten local interest? * Are the colors used on labels and packages offensive or attractive to the foreign buyer? For example, in some countries certain colors are associated with death. * Can labels and instructions be produced in official or customary languages if required by law or practice? * Does information on product content and country of origin have to be provided? * Are weights and measures stated in the local unit? Even with consumer products, packaging and describing contents in metric measurements (e.g., kilograms, liters) can be important. * Must each item be labeled individually? What is the language of the labeling? For example, ""Made in the USA"" may not be acceptable; the product may need to be labeled in the language spoken by the country's consumers. There may be special labeling requirements for foods, pharmaceuticals, and other products. * Are local tastes and knowledge considered?

At the same time, there is substantial heterogeneity in job quality as measured by differences in the average wages across sectors and firm sizes. Interestingly, medium and large firms tend to pay significantly higher labor costs. This appears to be driven by a different organizational structure which includes more organizational layers and managerial positions. High labor cost due to high skill premium could be one of the constraints for firms to grow.

Vocational schools offer courses lasting for one, two, three or four years, including a period of practical instruction. Art schools include music, dance, visual art and design. Students must pass an entrance examination to enter university in professional fields. When the State Secondary School Leaving Examination becomes operational - in 2008/9 for grammar schools, and 2009/10 for four-year vocational schools - it is expected to replace the entrance examination in most higher education institutions.

These include watershed management and promote increased agricultural productivity through strategies such as climate-smart agriculture , water conservation , soil fertility management , erosion control and soil management .	In support of agroforestry, which accounts for almost 75% of the country's land area, Rwanda is implementing the Rwanda Biodiversity Policy and the Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture 4 (PSTA 4) 2018- 2024, both of which advocate agroforestry, among other FLR practices that promote best practice. These include watershed management and promote increased agricultural productivity through strategies such as climate-smart agriculture, water conservation, soil fertility management, erosion control and soil management. Another key policy that supports agroforestry is the national horticulture policy, which promotes fruit tree planting by establishing incentive mechanisms, strengthening value chains and developing markets for horticulture products; it has a significant effect on the promotion of FLR in Rwanda. In particular, the horticulture policy promotes the establishment of village nurseries for fruit trees. Other policies that support agroforestry include the Agroforestry Strategy and Action Plan 2018-2027, which is being developed to promote leadership and synergies in agroforestry as well as to engage coordinated action and implementation in Rwanda's National Forestry Policy and National Agriculture Policy.

Previous IOM research projects conducted in partnership with academic and applied researchers around the world had brought disparities into sharp relief .	In this chapter we examined research and analysis output from a geographic perspective for the first time. Previous IOM research projects conducted in partnership with academic and applied researchers around the world had brought disparities into sharp relief.68 Our examination of the selected journals and IOM publications for 2017 and 2018 showed that there are indeed significant differences in focus, volume and author affiliation when published material is analysed by geographic region. As we have commented elsewhere, this is undoubtedly related to research funding sources (direct and indirect), with most sources emanating from wealthier countries. More effort, on a sustained basis, is needed to better support research institutions and researchers in developing countries, including by confronting some of the structural impediments that exists to funding and capacity. Analysis of IOM's own research publications confirmed anecdotal evidence that an important part of IOM's role is its focus on research concerning parts of the developing world, especially in Africa. Even greater effort to support research in developing States, however, is warranted as the vast majority of countries around the world work toward the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration - endeavours that would greatly benefit from the input of academic and applied researchers.

The recent political rapprochement with Eritrea , along with the GOE 's recent purchase of a 19 percent share of Berbera Port in Somaliland , which is being developed by DP World , could also provide alternative routes to transport goods to markets , and should eventually improve logistics .	Most goods continue to be transported by trucks to the Port of Djibouti; Ethiopia's government-owned trucking companies dominate the market, and the overall number of trucks is insufficient to meet demand. In November 2017, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway began operating on a very small scale, but currently is mainly transporting passengers. Plans to expand Ethiopia's rail systems beyond the Addis AbabaDjibouti link have been finalized, but construction, except for the Awash-Mekele rail line, has not begun due to a lack of financing. In September 2018, the government opened the logistics sector for foreign companies operating jointly with local partners holding minority shares. At the same time, the GOE approved the National Logistics Strategy, which permits the private sector to engage in multimodal transportation system to improve export competitiveness and efficiency. However, despite the change in legislation, private shippers and freight forwarders report they are still unable to engage in multimodal transportation.

Thailand has sponsored a well-organized International Peanut Conference in January 2005 in Bangkok, with Peanut CRSP. This international event was carried out successfully and was participated by about 150 peanut scientists and researchers and their partners from the U.S., Thailand, and other countries participating in Peanut CRSP, like Bulgaria, Philippines, etc. The Industry Incubator Model that was developed in the Philippines could be transferred to Thailand to expand the commercialization of peanut products from village-level micro-and small-scale enterprises to medium-to large-scale food industry companies. Training of managers, factory workers, and other business groups is an important activity. The Ministry of Industry is providing funds to Kasetsart University, through its Small-and Medium-Enterprise Funds, to train private companies. Thailand has been developed as a center for excellence in training of trainers and technology transfer and should continue this training project in the host country. The Thai project should continue to train Southeast Asian scientists, private food industry representatives, and extension workers on new/improved peanut products and methods to improve their quality and safety. It should expand its coverage to other regions to train trainers on peanut technologies based on the demand from other Peanut CRSP participating countries. The US could likely benefit by modeling the Thai approach to collaboration (between industry/universities/government) in the development of new peanut products and improved processing and packaging technologies.

There again , careful attention to the curriculum , as well as its delivery , would be essential .	The acquisition of behavioral skills demanded by formal firms as well as conducive to success in self-employment is an area of global policy interest. International evidence has suggested that behavioral skills remain malleable for longer, providing opportunities to train youths even after they dropped out of school. Evidence from Uganda or Liberia has suggested positive results of delivering behavioral skills training as a complement to technical or business skills training, particularly for women (see Box 6.4). More recent approaches attempt to leverage mentors or role models in behavioral skills training delivery. There again, careful attention to the curriculum, as well as its delivery, would be essential. Box 6.4: Learn. Work. THRIVE: ADOLESCENT GIRLS INITIATIVE PILOTS HELP YOUNG WOMEN TRANSITION TO PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT More than one-third of all youth are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) and across all regions of the world young women are worse off than young men. Although the gender gap in school enrollment has been closing, these gains have not yet translated into gains in secure, paid employment. Reaching girls during adolescence is critical because decisions made and behaviors established during this period affect their horizons later in life. To this end the WorldBank launched the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) to understand how to help young women transition to productive employment and has now implemented pilots in Afghanistan, Haiti, Jordan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, and South Sudan.

The out-of-school rates of children with disabilities are two to three times as high as those of children without disabilities in Colombia , the Maldives , Uganda and Yemen .	Many children with disabilities are out of school The out-of-school rate of children of primary and lower secondary school age is the proportion of children in a given age group who are not attending primary or secondary school. Some of these children may have attended school in the past and dropped out, some may enter school in the future, and some may never go to school.190 Data from six developing countries indicate that, on average, children with disabilities of primary school age (about 6 to 11 years in most countries) are more likely to be out of school than their peers without disabilities (Figure II.27).191 The largest gap between children with and without disabilities was reported for Cambodia, with a 50-percentage point difference between the out-of-school rate of children with and without disabilities (57 per cent versus 7 per cent), which means that children with disabilities are eight times as likely to be out of school as their peers without disabilities. In other countries, the gap is not as wide as in Cambodia but still proves the stark inequality between children with and without disabilities. The out-of-school rates of children with disabilities are two to three times as high as those of children without disabilities in Colombia, the Maldives, Uganda and Yemen. On average, in these countries, children with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be out of school as children without disabilities.

Nonagricultural self-employment in household enterprises accounts for 29.7 percent of employment in Coted'Ivoire. The large share of employment in nonagricultural household enterprises is often overlooked. Yet individual microenterprises are a key source of employment, particularly for the poor and women. Most of nonagricultural self-employment takes place in microenterprises owned and operated by the household (Figure1.18). Self-employed individuals working for themselves in small-scale commerce or service activities account for 65.9 percent of employment in the sector. Of the individual enterprises, 22 percent include the owner as well as unpaid family helpers from the same household. Only a small share of individual enterprises (approximately 10.4 percent) relies on workers from outside the households. As such, this sector includes household enterprises of very different nature than formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that mostly rely on wage workers.The median individual in nonagricultural self-employment tends to be young female with no formal education.

Land-use and climate change can also facilitate invasion by making habitats more challenging for native species and more hospitable to IAS (Mooney & Hobbs, 2001). Because disturbed habitats often favor rapid colonizers, they are particularly vulnerable to the invasion of alien species (Mooney & Hobbs, 2000).

This approach focuses on identifying activities that may hold latent comparative advantage and on removing the constraints that dissuade private firms from taking up these activities. In fact, there are many informal industrial clusters in urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. They produce garments, leather shoes, simple metal products, and furniture, among other things, though seldom for export.17 These clusters have spontaneously developed, suggesting a potential comparative advantage in these industries. Reducing logistics costs, removing red tape, and addressing coordination issues could create the necessary conditions to attract foreign investors to these clusters, especially at a time when wage increases in coastal China are encouraging the relocation of some industries where low labor costs are a key competitive factor (box 6.1).18 Jobs, which start to trigger agglomeration effects and make connections to the global economy, are good jobs for development in agrarian countries. To create more of these jobs and become centers of economic dynamism, cities need to be more functional. But even in the most optimistic scenario, it will take time to complete the urbanization process, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority for reducing the high poverty levels.

This information , collected along with the Incidentbased Uniform Crime Reporting Survey , has shed light on the nature and extent of police-reported violence against women in Canada .	Since 1962, aggregate police statistics have been collected in Canada, although it was not until 1988 that collection began of micro-data on the criminal event (including the weapon used and location of the event), on victims (including their sex, age and relationship to the accused) and the accused (including sex and age). This information, collected along with the Incidentbased Uniform Crime Reporting Survey, has shed light on the nature and extent of police-reported violence against women in Canada. In addition, the mandatory nature of the survey, along with the use of common definitions across the country, has meant that data on violence against women are nationally representative and comparable over time and across regions. The survey has also been critical in providing insight into how gender-based violence is treated within the criminal justice system, since information is also captured on clearance and charge rates.

In Kachin and northern Shan states, protracted displacement and - in the case of northern Shan - continued outbreaks of fighting are likely to continue exacerbating vulnerabilities. Unless humanitarian access improves, the situation will be further compounded by limited assistance and protection services, particularly for those in areas not controlled by the Government and other remote locations. This is likely to result in increased risky migration practices and negative coping mechanisms. Durable solutions will remain elusive for most displaced people, particularly in northern Shan. The prolonged nature of the displacement will continue to generate recurrent needs across sectors, including repair of temporary shelters and sanitation facilities, and distribution of non-food items.

Poverty and other barriers further reinforce gender disparities in learning opportunities The reasons why children do not attend school vary, but they are often associated with poverty, ethnicity, social exclusion, living in a rural area or slum, geographic remoteness, disasters, armed conflict, lack of basic facilities and poor-quality education. These barriers often interact with gender to create even greater disadvantages in learning opportunities. Countries face different challenges and need different policies depending on their circumstances. Among interventions that have successfully been used to reach the disadvantaged and the marginalized, especially girls include: the abolishment of school fees; increased education budgets; social cash transfers, especially to support poor families, making it easier for them to send their children to school; increasing attention to ethnic and linguistic minorities; overcoming conflicts that keep children out of school because of hostilities; and improving the quality of education.15 School progression at the primary level In order to achieve universal completion of primary education, it is important that all boys and girls of primary school age attend school and progress through primary education. High levels of repetition and drop out hinder a considerable number of children from transitioning to secondary education. Difficulty in progressing through the primary grades (repeating) or leaving school before completing the last grade of primary education (dropping out) occur for a variety of reasons, mostly related to the educational system and social and economic factors. Gender plays a significant role in school progression and completion in most countries. 15 UNESCO, 2014a.

In Bangladesh , the expansion of the light manufacturing sector has allowed for the integration of young women into the labor market , at a time of falling fertility rates .	The case of urbanizing economies such as Bangladesh may support the idea that the three major transformations happen simultaneously. Taking advantage of their abundance of relatively low-skilled labor, such economies can engage in world markets through light manufacturing. Wage employment is created in large numbers, providing opportunities for rural migrants, and cushioning social tensions at a time of rapid social change. In Bangladesh, the expansion of the light manufacturing sector has allowed for the integration of young women into the labor market, at a time of falling fertility rates. Employment opportunities for women have in turn led to growing female schooling, better human development outcomes, and faster poverty reduction.

The ' hardware-first ' strategy creates an external demand for materials and for China 's technology and knowhow .	The BRI will also support China's need to move up in the value-added chain towards hightechnology and services sectors. The 'hardware-first' strategy creates an external demand for materials and for China's technology and knowhow. Extending the life of older industries by creating demand and shifting locations helps debt-laden SOEs and other companies to cover variable costs, thereby avoiding defaults. Such a strategy, however, is unlikely to work in the long run. For the longer term, gradual deleveraging policies are already underway (including via debt-for-equity swaps and some asset transfers) and production targets are intended to set in motion longer-term restructuring of SOEs. It will be important for targets to be related to market mechanisms, and an interesting proposal for how this could be encouraged is set out in Chapter 3 of OECD, 2018a, Section 3.2). At the same time, the BRI lays longer-run economic foundations for economic growth based on connectivity and trade in the region (see Xi, J., 2017b and Johnson, 2016). All countries can benefit from this process if it is carried through with the openness and inclusiveness principles espoused by President Xi.

"Jobs and social cohesion 135 likely to witness ethnic violence, while riots were more frequent in cities with fewer economic ties. The existence of civil society organizations, such as clubs, political parties, labor unions, and business associations, contributed to reducing violence. But economic interests provided a common motivation for community members of both groups to participate in these associations.37 Jobs can also play a connecting role outside of urban environments. Studies in Ghana and Uganda illustrate how farmers connected through networks can access information and increase productivity. In Ghana, pineapple farmers adjusted their use of fertilizer in response to the successful or unsuccessful experiences of their neighbors. Farmers who were starting to cultivate pineapples were more likely to make changes based on information they had received from other farmers, showing the potential that on-the-job interactions and learning from others can have.38 In a qualitative survey, youth in Ghana who were asked about the characteristics that would make a job attractive emphasized the importance of jobs as opportunities to meet new people and build social networks.39 and the workplace in the United States finds that cross-cutting interactions at work lead to greater awareness of the rationales for views other than one's own and for ""exposing people to political dialogue across lines of political difference.""33 In a survey of 200 managers, owners, and sales representatives in Trinidad and Tobago, 81 percent of the interviewees reported that their working lives brought them into contact with people of a wider range of races than did their social lives.34 Interactions through jobs can contribute to greater trust and positive interdependence between groups. In the 18th century, Montesquieu wrote that ""the natural effect of commerce is to bring peace.

For many , the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint .	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where.

Every country has been invaded by IAS and society is paying the consequences. The costs of biological invasion are measured not just in currency, but also unemployment, damaged goods and equipment, power failures, food and water shortages, environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, increased rates and severity of natural disasters, disease epidemics, and lost lives (Bright, 1998, McNeely et al., 2001). Not only do IAS have obvious immediate and long-term impacts, effectively addressing the problem can require natural resource managers to invest substantial time and finances in management operations and work to restoreecosystems in order to re-produce their goods and services.

At the global level, GPE is taking action on a variety of fronts, primarily through the implementation of the Gender Equality Strategy 2016-2020 (Box 2.1). In the realm of advocacy, GPE is working with partners to build political support for girls' education and gender equality. For example, the Secretariat is working to ensure that girls' education is a key theme at the landmark Women Deliver global conference in June 2019, and engaging with the African Union Child Marriage campaign and Gender is My Agenda Campaign to provide an education perspective. GPE is a member of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI) working group on school-related gender-based violence, and is working with the Safe to Learn campaign to end violence in schools. GPE's Board chair is a member of the Commonwealth Platform for Girls' Education, a group of champions of girls' education, and GPE's CEO is a member of the G-7 Gender Equality Advisory Council, a group of gender equality experts advising the G-7 on key issues for girls and women, including education. GPE is also working to engage political champions for education and gender equality at the level of the African Union--including continued outreach to the Organization of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD)--and pursuing strategic partnerships with civil society organizations and youth at the global and regional levels to raise political will for, and commitments to, gender equality and girls' education. 25. In these countries, the situation for girls is especially challenging: They face both low completion rates (as well as high out-of-school rates) and large gender disparities in favor of boys.

Moving jobs center stage 31 New Zealand in 2007 to provide employment opportunities through migration, leading to higher remittances, improved knowledge of agricultural techniques, computer literacy, and English-language skills.125 Brazil provides an example of a rapidly formalizing country. Over the past decade, job creation in the formal sector has been three times as rapid as in the informal sector. Just in the five years leading up to the crisis, the formal share of total employment increased by about 5 percentage points.126 Non-contributory social protection programs such as Bolsa Familia, a simplification of tax rules for small business, increased incentives for firms to formalize their workers, and improved enforcement of tax and labor regulations contributed to this success. Poland, an aging society, has seen its employment ratio increase from 60 percent in 2006 to 65 percent in 2009. This was due to changes in the application of eligibility rules of disability pensions, and pension reforms adjusting the level of benefits down as life expectancy increases. In 2012, a new wave of pension reforms raised the retirement age to 67 for men and women from the current 65 for men and 60 for women.127 Connected jobs agendas: Global partnerships for jobs Policies for jobs in one country can have spillovers to other countries, both positive and negative. An important issue is whether international coordination mechanisms could influence government decisions to enhance the positive spillovers and mitigate the negative. Several areas lend themselves to more and better coordination.

Mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility .	Rethinking international migration, internal migration, mobility and urbanization That migration is the most problematic of the population variables is taken as given. Unlike the unique events of birth and death that define an individual's lifetime, migration can be a multiple event. Its measurement depends entirely upon how it is defined in time and across space. ... Despite all the problems inherent in the collection of migration data, significant progress has been achieved over recent years. The compilation of a world origin-destination database, developed originally at the University of Sussex and now much extended and maintained by the United Nations Population Division and the World Bank, has provided the framework for a more precise measurement of global international population movement.a These data showed that about 3 per cent of the world's population lived in a State or territory not of their birth and that that proportion had not changed significantly since the 1990s ... As the systems of internal and international migration evolve and change, so too, does the nature of the linkages between them ... other forms of short-term mobility emerge from essentially urban cultures and economies. ... The idea that most people do not move or are fixed at a specific location might be appealing but it is wrong. Mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility. Nevertheless, some peoples appear to move more than others and in different ways from others, which appears to be closely linked with the level of development in each country, which, in turn, is linked with the distribution of the population in each country. Despite all the difficulties with the measurement of internal migration as sketched above, considerable progress has been made towards the construction of analytical models that allow the comparison of patterns across space.

As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice , there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries .	Health worker migration in response to the global shortage of health professionals demands dedicated and effective management, including building the capacity of health systems in origin countries, promotion of good practices and prevention of negative effects of health worker migration. There is a global imbalance between the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.40 Well-managed migration of health workers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not only in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to promote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.

The Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) emerged out of a meeting of concerned organizations and individuals in 1996. It was designed to foster collaboration and action to address the ecological, economic, and social harm caused by invasive alien species. The first phase of GISP (1997-2000) focused on building a knowledge base on the issue of invasive alien species. This phase was driven by an international consortium of experts working as volunteers. Among the significant outputs were a global strategy on invasive alien species (McNeely ET Al., 2001) and invasive Alien Species: A toolkit of best prevention and management practices (Wittenberg & cock, 2001). The second phase of GISP (2000 - present) is designed to build upon the products of Phase I and foster greater international awareness of the problems caused by IAS. In Phase II, GISP will work with nations and regions on appropriate, cooperative measures for preventing, controlling, or eradicating IAS through six working groups, organized around the following topics: 1. National and regional facilitation and cooperation 2. Communication, education and outreach 3. Global information management 4. Pathway Management 5. Evaluation and assessment 6. Law and policy Phase II operates through an Executive Board, Advisory Panel of IAS experts, a formal Secretariat with paid staff (based in South Africa), and partnerships among countries and international organizations.

In India , farmers in many deepwater rice areas have recently incorporated grain legumes ( mainly mungbean ) , sesame , maize , and sorghum into their rotation .	In Bangladesh, deepwater rice farmers have traditionally grown a wide range of crops after the floods by seeding or planting onto the straw of the deepwater rice crop. These crops include pulses, oilseeds, spices, potato, onion, garlic, wheat, and barley. Postflood and dry-season cropping are now widely practiced in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Preflood cropping, although not widespread, includes mungbean, sesame, chili, and sorghum. These crops, if successful, are harvested before the main floods arrive. Sometimes jute or maize is planted along with deepwater rice or just before the deepwater rice crop is sown. In India, farmers in many deepwater rice areas have recently incorporated grain legumes (mainly mungbean), sesame, maize, and sorghum into their rotation. They grow these crops as a mixture with deepwater rice on stored soil water at the start of the wet season.

Joint Assessment of Prospects for Harmonisation within the Justice Sector in Bangladesh .	"Partial separation of the Judiciary from the executive has been achieved. Article 22 of the Constitution provides that ""The State shall ensure the separation of the judiciary from executive organs of the State"". The legal and administrative framework to achieve this was only put in place in 2007. Successive governments in waiting pledged in their manifestos to effect the separation but once in government, did nothing. The catalyst of the recent move towards independence from the executive was a case brought by over 400 judicial officers in 1995 requesting a ruling on the question of separation of the judiciary from the executive.52 The High Court heard the case in 1997 and gave what is now a historic judgment comprising 12 directives relating to separation of the judiciary. In 1999, the appellate division of the Supreme Court heard the GoB's appeal against the High Court decision and directed the government to implement the 12 directives. The pace of change was 'glacial',53 however, until the Caretaker Government in 2007 amended rules made under the Constitution relating to the appointment, posting, discipline and removal of the judiciary; properly constituted the Judicial Service Commission;54 set up a 47 Transparency International. 2007.

"The issue of violence is a recurring theme in the latest dossiers. The importance of this issue reflects the tragic consequences of migration policies in particular contexts or crises, and the emergence of work around migrants' journeys. The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europe"" (33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cecile Canut and Anaik Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language approach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. This perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting sociospatial inequalities in the era of globalization."

Basically such features are that: 1. They are based upon the collective rights of the respective indigenous people, nation or community to lands, territories and resources, under national contexts; 2. They are established as protected areas in application of the right of self-determination, exercised mainly through: * Self-declaration of the protected area by the indigenous people or nation with collective territorial rights on the area; * Free, prior and informed consent of the people, nation or community with territorial rights on the area, in cases where the designation proposal is originated in government agencies, conservation organizations or other actors. 3. They are based on ancestral or traditional occupation; 4. Occupation, use and management are connected to and dependent upon the broader socio-cultural and political structure of a people or nation, which includes their customary law and institutions; 5. They are self-governed by indigenous institutions within their territories and the protected areas contained therein, in application of arrangements established with system-level protected area authorities. 3.

Part 2 Ecological accounting under the glass dome. Only sunlight has access to the futuristic city. With the sunshine a certain amount of energy enters - which is all there is to power the city. Though hypothetical, this approach somewhat reflects that of the Footprint. How large must the glass dome be - how much farm land, how many forests and other areas must it encompass for the city to be viable? Of course one can't simply imagine each city in isolation. The areas from which urban centers import their resources are distributed across large parts of the world, and, in times of globalization, cities compete for the global supply of natural capital. A city which provides a comparable quality of life with a smaller per capita Footprint is also less dependent upon imports, and therefore more competitive. If today the majority of people live in cities, then that is exactly where the future of civilization will be decided. The Footprint helps in adjusting infrastructure and urban planning for the future. Take traffic for example. As complex as discussions are about transportation and infrastructure, the Footprint can reduce the information to a single number each time: the required area. This is crucial when making investment decisions, be it for building roads, tracks, bridges, harbors or entire settlements. Infrastructure and planning decisions will shape the way residents live for years to come; the Footprint can help decision-makers balance the needs of citizens with a growing concern about the city's use of natural resources.

"96 INCB REPORT 2015 action plan"", which has helped to improve resource targeting and thereby to gather more accurate data on methamphetamine abuse and trafficking.

In 2014, law enforcement authorities in Australia reported ""ecstasy"" seizures of several tons each. The Australian Crime Commission indicated that a seizure of almost two tons made in November 2014 was indicative of the resurgence of the ""ecstasy"" market in both the country and the region. The Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System reported that in 2014 the availability of ""ecstasy"" pills, powder, and capsules appeared to have increased significantly from 2013.

Different jobs require different combinations of manual skills (needed for physical tasks), cognitive skills (needed for mental tasks), and social skills (needed to interact with others).

On-farm and off-farm activities can be complementary in assisting households to manage risk. In other contexts off-farm income has been important in helping small-scale farmers cope with shocks in India (Gaurav 2015), Mozambique (Cunguara et al. 2011), and South America (Bebbington 1999). In Odisha, vulnerable farming communities are characterized by dependence Ecology and Society 22(4): 3 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol22/iss4/art3/ on subsistence rice farming and limited off-farm opportunities (Panda 2016). In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined. This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.

Mexico recently created a sui generis system of protection and Mexico's new registration system for future GIs includes certain elements aimed at improving and respecting due process and transparency. The United States continues to work closely with Mexico to make progress in addressing other trade-related IP issues, and these efforts have resulted in some significant progress.

Meanwhile , growing scarcity of land , labor , and water continues to drive up the cost of rice production in spite of more efficient use of inputs ( through improved crop management practices ) and saving of labor ( through mechanization ) .	The increasing cost of rice production in middle-and high-income countries is preventing them from exporting surplus rice that has resulted from declining domestic consumption. Instead, it has lowered production. In Japan, the rice harvest reached 18.8 million t in 1967, after which it gradually fell to 10 million t in 1999. In Taiwan (China), the harvest reached 3.6 million t in 1976, whereas current production is below 2.0 million t. Meanwhile, growing scarcity of land, labor, and water continues to drive up the cost of rice production in spite of more efficient use of inputs (through improved crop management practices) and saving of labor (through mechanization). The unit cost of production is 10 times higher in Japan and seven times higher in the Republic of Korea than in Thailand and Vietnam, the major rice exporters in the world market (Table 4). The Japanese government has encouraged farmers to divert rice land to other crops, but not all rice land is suitable for other crops. 66 Rice almanac Under political pressure from farm lobbies, the government had to protect the domestic rice market by increasing prices and providing farm subsidies, to keep a balance between incomes of rice farmers and incomes of urban labor households. Rice production had been adjusted to domestic demand through manipulation of trade, pricing, and subsidy policies.

Jobs improve material well-being Over the course of a country 's development , higher productivity and labor earnings allow households to allocate more time to investment and consumption activities and less to production .	Jobs improve material well-being Over the course of a country's development, higher productivity and labor earnings allow households to allocate more time to investment and consumption activities and less to production. Thus, schooling and retirement gain importance relative to work. For the past century or so, the number of hours worked by youth in industrial countries has declined steadily as access to education has increased. Similarly, the number of years in retirement has increased in parallel with longer life expectancy.1 Higher earnings also facilitate longer periods of job seeking, especially among younger household members, often leading to higher unemployment rates. Among men and women of prime age (25 to 54), total working hours (market and nonmarket) have remained relatively stable, with the main change being the growing share of market activities among women (figure 2.1). These general trends are not ironclad, however.

Strength: Thai scientists and researchers at Kasetsart University and their development partners have become proficient trainers on post-harvest, processing, and utilization technologies with appropriate methods to suit different groups of clientele. The Thai Project Team was able to build commitment from the government and other partners so the project has trained significant numbers of village-level processors in Phase 2.

Extension workers have day-to-day interactions with villagers and involving them as partners would ensure sustainability of technical advisory service to farmers and processors, which the university researchers cannot provide. They have influenced the conduct of field days and preparation of extension-type media materials, such as brochures and leaflets in Thai language. These materials have facilitated information dissemination and created greater public awareness. Strength: Thailand shows examples of successful training courses for various client groups, including a strong training of trainers program.

The first assesses the degree to which women are empowered in five domains of empowerment ( 5DE ) in agriculture .	ISSN 2040-8188 ISBN 978-1-907194-45-0 The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a new survey-based index designed to measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. The WEAI was initially developed as a tool to reflect women's empowerment that may result from the United States government's Feed the Future Initiative, which commissioned the development of the WEAI. The WEAI can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time. The WEAI is an aggregate index, reported at the country or regional level, based on individual-level data collected by interviewing men and women within the same households. The WEAI comprises two subindexes. The first assesses the degree to which women are empowered in five domains of empowerment (5DE) in agriculture. It reflects the percentage of women who are empowered and, among those who are not, the percentage of domains in which women enjoy adequate achievements. These domains are (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decisionmaking power about productive resources, (3) control of use of income, (4) leadership in the community, and (5) time allocation. The second subindex (the Gender Parity Index [GPI]) measures gender parity. The GPI reflects the percentage of women who are empowered or whose achievements are at least as high as the men in their households. For those households that have not achieved gender parity, the GPI shows the empowerment gap that needs to be closed for women to reach the same level of empowerment as men. This technical paper documents the development of the WEAI and presents pilot data from Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda, so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings.

The first part looks at three aspects of the environment that have different effects on the lives of women and men :2 access to water and sanitation , access to modern energy services , and exposure to natural hazards .	Women and the environment is one of the 12 critical areas of concern for achieving gender equality identified in the Beijing Platform for Action.1 The Platform for Action recognizes that environmental conditions have a different impact on the lives of women and men due to existing gender inequality. It also stresses that women's role in sustainable development is hampered by unequal access to economic resources, information and technology, and limited participation in policy formulation and decision-making in natural resources and environment management. This chapter examines the links between gender and the environment in two parts. The first part looks at three aspects of the environment that have different effects on the lives of women and men:2 access to water and sanitation, access to modern energy services, and exposure to natural hazards. It shows that the burden of work resulting from lack of access to clean water and energy falls mostly on the shoulders of women. In ad- 1 United Nations, 1995. 2 Other aspects of the environment that may have a different impact on the lives of women and men could not be analysed due to lack of data (see box 7.1). dition, exposure to inadequate water may result in higher mortality among women than men as a result of diarrhoea in contexts where access to health services remains unequal. Household air pollution resulting from the use of firewood and other solid fuels threatens the lives of women and men in many developing countries, but women are more exposed than men to indoor pollutants due to their role in cooking and caring for children and other family members. Gender roles may also worsen women's vulnerability during disasters and waste their potential as a source of resilience.

From primary school age , students are exposed to the language and then continue , where possible , to improve their skills , all the way up to university .	Increasingly important English benefits from government focus English plays an important role in Bangladesh. From primary school age, students are exposed to the language and then continue, where possible, to improve their skills, all the way up to university. This sharpening of language skills allows access to better salary opportunities in what can be considered a disadvantaged country. The quality of the education system differs by location: in rural areas access to education is limited, although the government is actively looking to find a solution to this problem with increased spending. Currently 17% of government spending in Bangladesh is on education. Improving English skills is viewed as an important means of advancing both individual wealth and the economy of the country. The aim is to create a workforce that can service international companies' direct investment in Bangladesh, who typically use English as a lingua franca. English speakers in the business environment are expected to speak English to at least intermediate level. Furthermore, in some sectors, such as foreign trade and telecommunications, employees are expected to have a good level of English. On top of this, 24 of 30 companies interviewed by Euromonitor indicated that employees with a good command of English advance quicker than those who do not - ultimately resulting in higher salaries. Private education for primary and secondary education will also play an important role in individual growth, with business leaders of the future expected to be primarily privately educated, and with a high level of English.

This is not surprising since cropland typically uses the most suitable and productive land areas , unless they have been urbanized .	In 2007, the world had 3.9 billion global hectares of cropland biocapacity as compared to 1.6 billion hectares of cropland area (Figure 1). This difference is due to the relatively high productivity of cropland compared to other land use types. This is not surprising since cropland typically uses the most suitable and productive land areas, unless they have been urbanized. Thus, cropland affords more biologically productive services to humans than the same physical area of other land use types.

Private and public insurance schemes should not limit the availability of coverage for pre-existing conditions. These discriminatory practices disproportionately affect persons with disabilities.

Currently , Taiwan has recourse to an SSG for 17 agricultural product categories , including poultry meat , certain types of offal , and milk .	The Taiwan authorities maintained tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) on a number of products when it became a WTO Member in January 2002, including small passenger vehicles, fish products, and agricultural products. Taiwan subsequently eliminated TRQs for four fish products and eight agricultural products. Nevertheless, many TRQs remain in place, especially in the agriculture area. TRQs still cover 16 agricultural products, including rice, peanuts, bananas, and pineapples. Taiwan has recourse to special safeguards (SSG) for agricultural products covered by TRQs. SSGs, which are permitted under Article 5 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, allow Taiwan to impose additional duties when import quantities exceed SSG trigger volumes or import prices fall below SSG trigger prices. Because Taiwan previously did not import many of these products, its SSG trigger volumes are relatively low. Currently, Taiwan has recourse to an SSG for 17 agricultural product categories, including poultry meat, certain types of offal, and milk. U.S. stakeholders continue to request that Taiwan lower or eliminate tariffs on many goods, including large motorcycles, agricultural products, and soda ash. 462 | foreign trade barriers .

Many countries have implemented ""farmer field schools,"" which entail season-long weekly meetings in which farmers learn about the value of natural enemies and other aspects of growing a healthy crop. Another approach is the mass communication of ""simple rules"" to farmers. A campaign to encourage farmers to experiment in eliminating early season insecticide applications has been very successful in Vietnam and is now being attempted in Thailand. The campaign used billboards, cartoon characters, information handouts, and humorous radio programs; it reduced rice farmers' insecticide use by an estimated 70% and the proportion of farmers believing that insecticides bring higher yields fell from more than 80% to just 13%."

This would be consistent with the patterns of industrialization in Japan ; Korea ; Taiwan , China ; and the United States , where the initial geographical concentration of industries was followed by dispersion within the same country .	"The East Asian trends are consistent with the ""flying geese"" pattern of development, where economic transformation is consistent with dynamic changes in comparative advantage. Industrialization in East Asian countries began with the development of labor-intensive sectors, gradually shifted to capital-intensive sectors, and then to knowledge-intensive activities. In parallel, wages rose and skills increased.35 First Japan, then Korea, and more recently China followed a similar pattern. As labor costs increase further, light manufacturing jobs are likely to migrate away from coastal China, where most industries have concentrated. By some estimates, nearly 100 million jobs are at stake.36 The migration of light manufacturing jobs out of coastal China could open a once-in-ageneration opportunity for countries in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia to jump-start their industrialization. But some observers predict that the migration will go mainly to the inland areas in China, where wage rates are lower than on the coast. This would be consistent with the patterns of industrialization in Japan; Korea; Taiwan, China; and the United States, where the initial geographical concentration of industries was followed by dispersion within the same country.37 However, China's labor market is relatively integrated to the point where even unskilled wage rates in rural areas have been increasing rapidly.38 Therefore, an overall decline in the manufacturing share of GDP in China might be unavoidable, opening up the opportunity for labor-intensive industrialization in other developing countries.39 The rapid growth of labor productivity in manufacturing is resulting in the stagnation or even the decline of the number of manufacturing jobs worldwide (figure 7.2). Global employment in manufacturing increased by only 30 percent from 1990 to 2008, with most of the expansion taking place in Asia, especially in China. Given that manufacturing jobs connect to exSource: World Development Report 2013 team estimates based on data from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) database and United Nations Statistics Division.

ISSN 2040-8188 ISBN 978-1-907194-45-0 The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a new survey-based index designed to measure the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. The WEAI was initially developed as a tool to reflect women's empowerment that may result from the United States government's Feed the Future Initiative, which commissioned the development of the WEAI. The WEAI can also be used more generally to assess the state of empowerment and gender parity in agriculture, to identify key areas in which empowerment needs to be strengthened, and to track progress over time. The WEAI is an aggregate index, reported at the country or regional level, based on individual-level data collected by interviewing men and women within the same households. The WEAI comprises two subindexes. The first assesses the degree to which women are empowered in five domains of empowerment (5DE) in agriculture. It reflects the percentage of women who are empowered and, among those who are not, the percentage of domains in which women enjoy adequate achievements. These domains are (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decisionmaking power about productive resources, (3) control of use of income, (4) leadership in the community, and (5) time allocation. The second subindex (the Gender Parity Index [GPI]) measures gender parity. The GPI reflects the percentage of women who are empowered or whose achievements are at least as high as the men in their households. For those households that have not achieved gender parity, the GPI shows the empowerment gap that needs to be closed for women to reach the same level of empowerment as men. This technical paper documents the development of the WEAI and presents pilot data from Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda, so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings.

In favorable rainfed lowlands, small investments in water-control measures can increase water control considerably. In these cases, cropping systems are on a continuum between rainfed and irrigated ecosystems and available technologies of the irrigated sector need only minor adaptations. Considerable adaptations or different technologies are needed in the rainfed lowlands where risk of drought or flood is significant. About 34% of the world's total rice land or approximately 54 million ha are rainfed. Adverse climate, poor soils, and a lack of suitable modern technologies keep farmers from being able to increase productivity.

Combined with solid ICT readiness ( 18th ) , these factors help encourage T & T investment , utilization of digital services and business travel .	Selected Country/Economy Analysis The United States is the top scorer in the Americas, moving up one place to rank fifth globally. The combination of the overall size of its economy and T&T competitiveness helps explain why the country has the largest T&T GDP in the world, accounting for over one-fifth of the global total. In comparison to the global average, one of the United States' greatest advantages comes from its natural (5th) and cultural (12th) resources, which also helps separate it from many other developed nations in the rankings. The country is well known for its numerous World Heritage natural sites (3rd) and extensive wildlife (13th), which drive nature-based tourist arrivals (35th). The flow of travellers is assisted by excellent air transport (3rd) and tourist services (4th) infrastructure and increasingly efficient ground transport (17th to 6th). However, the primary reason for the United States' improvement is its better enabling environment (25th to 16th), including enhancements to already-strong business environment (16th to 4th) and human resource and labour market (13th to 1st) areas.

"In September 2017 , Ghana introduced electronic ( "" paperless "" ) cargo clearance at ports to reduce clearance times ."	"Ghanaian customs practices and port infrastructure continue to present major obstacles to trade. Officials have introduced risk-management approaches, such as the Pre-Arrival Assessment Reporting System. However, the majority of imports are still subject to inspection on arrival, causing delays and increased costs. Importers report erratic application of customs and other import regulations, lengthy clearance procedures, and corruption. The resulting delays can contribute to product deterioration and result in significant losses for importers of perishable goods. Additionally, Ghana's ports suffer from congested roads and lack a functioning rail system to transport freight, creating long waits for ships to berth at cargo terminals and for containers to be transported out of the ports. Ghana Ports and Harbor Authority (GPHA) is working to modernize both the Ports of Tema and Takoradi. In November 2016, Ghana launched a $1.5 billion public-private partnership between GPHA and Meridian Port Services, a partnership representing interests from the Netherlands and France, to quadruple the capacity of the Tema Port. This port expansion project is expected to be completed in 2019. Ghana has launched several initiatives over the past couple of years to support online information and processing of trade transactions, including the development of a National Single Window. In September 2017, Ghana introduced electronic (""paperless"") cargo clearance at ports to reduce clearance times. The Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has taken on the inspection and valuation role once occupied by five licensed destination inspection companies, which many believed were the source of the long clearance delays. However, the one percent fee associated with the inspections is still collected."	"In September 2017, Ghana introduced electronic (""paperless"") cargo clearance at ports to reduce clearance times."

Methodological notes The Coverage in law indicator ( or legal / statutory coverage ) estimates the scope of the legislation , namely the number of workers to whom the law applies .	Methodological notes The Coverage in law indicator (or legal/statutory coverage) estimates the scope of the legislation, namely the number of workers to whom the law applies. The Coverage in practice indicator (or effective coverage) determines the extent to which the law is actually implemented and thus the share of the population that is benefiting from its application. This measurement seeks to identify the number of persons covered de facto in relation to those covered de jure. Effective coverage is usually lower than statutory coverage due to gap in compliance and implementation. Coverage in practice can be measured in terms of: actual coverage (or actual beneficiaries), namely the number of people accessing the right to maternity leave or maternity leave cash benefits; or potential coverage (or protected persons), specifically the number of people who have the rights or benefits guaranteed but are not necessarily currently beneficiaries. The table presents potential coverage, namely the share of protected persons.

Some selected thematic trends The academic literature on migration responds in part to trends in migration phenomena and policy as well as to shifts in migration-related theory and previously published literature. Normally, there is a discernible time lag between the onset of a phenomenon and the appearance of scientific literature, this owing to the time required for research and then for publishing. The literature on the Syrian refugee crisis is now beginning to appear in significant amounts, and we can expect that the literature on the United Nations' Global Compacts will start appearing in 2019.

Attitudes refer to the sets of beliefs that the learner holds towards members of the target group and also towards his own culture ( Brown , 2000 ) .	Teaching materials are very important in the whole process of teaching and learning to any subject. They make learning more pleasant to the students because they offer a reality of experiences, which stimulates self activity and imagination on the part of the students. Attitudes refer to the sets of beliefs that the learner holds towards members of the target group and also towards his own culture (Brown, 2000). Language attitude is an important concept because it plays a key role in language learning. In education, attitudes are considered both as input and output. Motivation is the most used concept for explaining failure or success of a learner. Also motivation has been regarded as one of the main factors that influence the speed and amount of success of foreign language learners. (Gardener, 2006). It has been seen that passive learning, lack of adequate materials for teaching, motivation of the students and attitudes towards learning keeping the rural area students inefficient in English language compared to urban students.

Ecological Footprint accounts capture these changes as they occur and can determine the extent to which these innovations have succeeded in bringing human demand within the capacity of the planet 's ecosystems .	Does the Ecological Footprint matter if the supply of renewable resources can be increased and advances in technology can slow the depletion of non-renewable resources? The Ecological Footprint measures the current state of resource use and waste generation. It asks: In a given year, did human demand on ecosystems exceed the ability of ecosystems to meet this demand? Footprint analysis reflects both increases in the productivity of renewable resources (for example, if the productivity of cropland is increased, then the Footprint of 1 tonne of wheat will decrease) and technological innovation (for example, if the paper industry doubles the overall efficiency of paper production, the Footprint per tonne of paper will be cut by half ). Ecological Footprint accounts capture these changes as they occur and can determine the extent to which these innovations have succeeded in bringing human demand within the capacity of the planet's ecosystems. If there is a sufficient increase in ecological supply and a reduction in human demand due to technological advances or other factors, Footprint accounts will show this as the elimination of global overshoot.	Ecological Footprint accounts capture these changes as they occur and can determine the extent to which these innovations have succeeded in bringing human demand within the capacity of the planet's ecosystems.

As outlined in the WHO Global Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on foreign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health systems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending with employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-topopulation ratios; and adopting innovative financing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to provide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training.

"Another sevencountries had legislation that offered the possibility of risk assessments and/or the option for a woman to request the labour inspectorate to undertake an assessment. For example, in Mauritania, a pregnant woman, like other women workers, may request that the labour inspector order an examination by an approved medical practitioner in order to ascertain that the work which is given to her is not beyond her strength. In Benin, the labour inspectorate may require a risk assessment for female workers or minors, or an ""interested person"" may request one.23 Social partners are essential in the development, effective implementation and evaluation of workplace risk assessments, which represent an important entry point to further maternity protection at the workplace. Alongside risk assessments, information and awareness-raising at the workplace are important to prevent and tackle hazardous and unhealthy work or any occupational health and safety (OSH) risks. In the Netherlands, 2012 amendments to a Working Conditions Decree require the employer to provide effective information on work-related risks during pregnancy and breastfeeding periods within two weeks from the date the employer is notified of the worker's pregnancy.

Unlike many parts of Asia , where the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield and the poverty incidence has declined , cereal yield has remained low and poverty incidence high in these Sub-Saharan countries ( figure 6.1 ) .	Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries, because poor people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.8 Since 1700, virtually every example of mass poverty reduction has actually begun with an increase in agricultural productivity.9 Constraints on agricultural growth vary depending on the availability of land relative to the availability of farm labor. Compared with other areas of the developing world, SubSaharan Africa was traditionally seen as a continent of ample land and scarce labor. While that may still be true in some areas, it no longer applies to countries in the south and east of the continent. In Mozambique, the average farm size is less than 1.5 hectares. As the area under cultivation declines relative to the size of the population, producing sufficient food becomes a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place. In many agrarian economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have yet to occur. Unlike many parts of Asia, where the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield and the poverty incidence has declined, cereal yield has remained low and poverty incidence high in these Sub-Saharan countries (figure 6.1). Some Asian economies, such as Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar, face similar challenges.

Recommendations arising from the results of the yield-gap experiments will be transferred to farmers via the field schools and field days that have been shown to be very effective in the Ejura area. A number of field days/workshops have been held to which banks and other NGO's have been invited. The Project is also collaborating with an NGO (PLAN Ghana) who are working with women's groups. An additional NGO is working on oil extraction from soybean. The company requiring the oil provides inputs, the costs of which are deducted at delivery. It is hoped that groundnut oil extraction may be included in this scheme. Publications include: Naab, J. B., P. Singh, K. J. Boote, J. W. Jones, and K. O.

However, wheat is more important in some areas, especially in the North. Although rice is still a large part of people's diets, its importance has declined considerably in the past 15 years. Since 1985, the share of total calories obtained from rice has fallen from 38% to 30%. During this same period, the share of total calories coming from wheat has declined only slightly, from about 22% to 19%. In terms of protein, rice and wheat each accounted for slightly more than one-fourth of total protein intake in the late 1980s, but during the 1990s this share declined sharply, and it now stands at slightly less than one-fifth for each cereal.

Resource-rich countries face similar pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and the commodity booms of the last few years have only made these pressures stronger. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance are needed to jump-start development, cope with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact on export diversification.77 An enabling business environment. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase, is the top constraint in low-and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets have the potential to allocate resources toward more productive uses, thwart the channeling of resources to those with political connections or economic power, and expand financial in- those jobs. If this is the case, policies should remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily removed, offsetting them may be an option, but the costs and benefits of doing so need to be carefully assessed.

"The experience of exile and life after it is also examined in the dossier ""Living, thinking, writing in exile"" (33/1, 2017) coordinated by the historian Ralph Schor, who strives to understand the paths and identity choices of a particular category of exiles: writers and thinkers. Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of oneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer's perspective. Some varia articles 340 Appendices focus on the links between film and migration experiences in countries with a film industry. In what way do cinema and photography open up new discursive spaces? A special richly illustrated dossier is devoted to the links between photography, migration and cities (32/3-4, 2016). How cinema and photography reflect migrants' migratory experiences, imaginations, living, housing and working conditions? These articles also show how images contribute to current events and the production of memory, instilling emotions, reflections, mobilizations and denunciations."

Fostering FLR activities , such as conservation agriculture and the management , instead of burning , of crop residues is part of what is proposed to achieve this objective .	The policies and strategies under MAG include (1) the Institutional Strategic Plan, aimed at promoting the restoration of priority ecosystems, riparian areas and forests and enhancing sustainable agriculture to create integrated biological corridors, and (2) the National Forestry Policy, which has as its primary objective the sustainable management of water and soil resources. FLR activities linked to good agricultural practices and afforestation/reforestation activities are supported by Second Bonn Challenge progress report MAG to improve the resilience of farming systems and achieve climate change mitigation under the National Forestry Policy. The National Strategy for Watershed Management addresses the need to foster agriculture that is both sustainable and resilient to climate change through FLR activities, such as reforestation, improved irrigation and soil management practices in aquifer recharge zones and dry regions. There is also the National Forestry Strategy, which enumerates a series of actions to restore ecosystems and increase forest cover. The strategy includes five activities that directly relate to FLR: (i) managing financial resources to implement forest restoration projects; (ii) establishing forestry incentives; (iii) promoting forest conservation; (iv) fostering agroforestry and commercial plantations; and (v) providing support to set up forest communities and non-profit associations that will implement reforestation and forest conservation. Finally, mag is responsible for the national policy on climate change for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture. The primary objective of this policy is to promote the sustainable management of natural resources through soil and water conservation practices that both improve local adaptive capacities and unlock the climate change mitigation potential of the land-use sector, giving priority to the most vulnerable populations.

NovaSil as a feed additive (0.25% of the feed) binds aflatoxin and prevents adsorption, metabolism, and subsequent aflatoxicosis in animals. Research to transfer this to human application was added in this phase1. A study showed that lifetime exposure to NovaSil was harmless to rats. Based on these results, a human study was conducted in the U.S.A. that showed no adverse nutritional effects from consuming the clay. The program has started to collect data on human safety and to test the efficacy of NovaSil in people in Ghana, who are naturally exposed to high levels of aflatoxin. Necessary Ghanaian Governmental clearances have been obtained.

Even in Phase 1 of the project, PCRSP had already linked with the food industry to test and later commercialize peanut-based products developed in the Philippines and the U.S., through UGA. This initial linkage is with mediumsized companies (Newborn Foods, Inc. and Marigold Commodities Inc.). The availability of improved and safe peanut products in stores and supermarkets in Metro Manila, generated by the Vitamin A-fortified peanut butter, increased local consumption. An increase in peanut export, because of aflatoxin-free peanut-based products (i.e., Mama Sita,s ""Kare-kare"" Mix), also contributed to this achievement."

Indigenous children were 25 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous children. Leaked footage exposed abuses of children in prison in the Northern Territory, including tear gassing, restraints, choking and solitary confinement. In response, a Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory was established and reported on 17 November. An independent review of youth detention centres in Queensland released in April found abuses including solitary confinement, use of dogs to intimidate, missing CCTV footage, and children at risk of self-harm being sedated and hogtied. Further alleged abuses emerged in Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian capital territory and Western Australia. Indigenous adults were 15 times more likely to be jailed than non-Indigenous adults. At least eight Indigenous people died in police custody.

The Ecological Footprint is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere .	The Ecological Footprint is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere. More precisely, it measures the amount of biologically productive land and water area required to produce all the resources an individual, population, or activity consumes, and to absorb the waste they generate, given prevailing technology and resource management practices. This area can then be compared with biological capacity (biocapacity), the amount of productive area that is available to generate these resources and to absorb the waste. If a land or water area provides more than one of these services it is only counted once, so as not to exaggerate the amount of productive area actually available. Land and water area is scaled according to its biological productivity. This scaling makes it possible to compare ecosystems with differing bioproductivity and in different areas of the world in the same unit, a global hectare. A global hectare represents a hectare with world average productivity.	The Ecological Footprint is a measure of the demand human activity puts on the biosphere.

Cross-country evidence from across the world shows convincingly that movements out of agriculture to the rural economy, secondary towns, and secondary cities (defined as less than 1 million inhabitants) are more poverty reducing than exits out of agriculture into the metropoles.48 While those who make it to the city, tend to gain much more on average than those who move nearby, only few of the poor manage to do so, and many more find their way into off-farm activities when they are nearby. The end outcome is one of an accelerated poverty reduction when people can find off-farm employment opportunities nearby. Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing areas. These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery), storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities. Even before accounting for related services agribusiness activities, including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing (ISIC 15) alone accounted for more than 30 percent of total formal employment and more than 20 percent of value added in formal firms (Figure5.5). Agribusiness also forms the only source of formal manufacturing jobs outside Abidjan. The past couple of years have witnessed a small increase in formal enterprise establishments outside Abidjan (Chapter5), though much room for expansion remains.

"It is important to highlight at the outset that there are fundamental differences in the publishing processes for academic and non-academic material, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The academic publishing system is largely focused on producing journal articles and books. This process typically involves multi-stage reviews and editorial comments involving authors, editors and reviewers. Most published academic research (""white"" literature) is behind paywalls (that is, not freely accessible), and often managed by commercial publishers. In contrast, the production of research and analysis publications outside of academic publishing (""grey"" literature) generally involves faster and simpler processes that are typically, although not always, characterized by more limited peer review. Contributions from grey literature (such as research reports, working papers and government/official documents) are usually freely available. A report such as this, designed to contribute to our collective understanding of migration and mobility in an increasingly interconnected world, would clearly be incomplete without describing the role of grey literature, which has been ""recognized as a key source of evidence, argument, innovation, and understanding"".6 The volume, diversity and growth of both white and grey literature preclude a systematic review of all the material produced and published on migration in 2017 and 2018. Instead, this chapter highlights examples of key contributions made during this period, published in English by a selection of academic journals and intergovernmental organizations. It provides an update to the chapter in World Migration Report 2018, including by focusing on different academic journals and intergovernmental organizations, and their key output in 2017 and 2018.7 The next section provides an overview of the different actors involved in migration research and analysis. The third section features recent, selected contributions from academia and intergovernmental organizations, and the reach and impact of some of the migration research materials published."

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) allows for halal food to be prepared, processed, transported, or stored using facilities that have been previously used for non-halal foods, provided that Islamic cleaning procedures have been observed. However, under Brunei's Halal Meat Act, halal meat (including beef, mutton, lamb, and chicken) can be imported only by a person holding a halal import permit and an export permit from the exporting country. Additionally, the importers and local suppliers of halal meat must be Muslim. The Bruneian government maintains a list of the foreign and local slaughtering centers (abattoirs) that have been inspected and declared fit for supplying meat that can be certified as halal. Brunei's stringent system of abattoir approval involves on-site inspections carried out by Bruneian government officials for every establishment seeking to export meat or poultry to Brunei. Halal meat must be kept separately from non-halal meat at all times, and halal certification must be renewed annually by the Brunei Religious Council.

The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europe"" (33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cecile Canut and Anaik Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language approach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. This perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting sociospatial inequalities in the era of globalization."

About four in five rural workers are engaged in agriculture, which is consistent with the ratios observed in other countries at similar levels of development. Yet only a very small (and relatively smaller) share of the rural population (4 percent) holds nonagricultural wage jobs, pointing to limited employment opportunities in the rural economy, and consistent with the high degree of urbanization and urban concentration in Coted'Ivoire.

Rice cultivation was introduced to the New World by early European settlers .	As a result of Europe's great Age of Exploration, new lands to the west became available for exploitation. Rice cultivation was introduced to the New World by early European settlers. The Portuguese carried it to Brazil and the Spanish introduced its cultivation to several locations in Central and South America. The first record for North America dates from 1685, when the crop was produced on the coastal lowlands and islands of what is now South Carolina. The crop may well have been carried to that area by slaves brought from the African continent. Early in the 18th century, rice spread to what is now Louisiana, but not until the 20th century was it produced in California's Sacramento Valley. The introduction into California corresponded almost exactly with the timing of the first successful crop in Australia's New South Wales.

This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment and their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity. The Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage evaluates annually nominations proposed by States Parties to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage and decides whether or not to inscribe those cultural practices and expressions of intangible heritage on the Convention's Lists.

The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country 's natural resources , it also can measure sustainability at the personal , city , and institutional levels .	"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month? Such are the questions you will encounter when calculating your personal Ecological Footprint online. At the end of the quiz, you are presented with the number of global hectares needed to support your given lifestyle. This number is then converted into how many planet Earths would infobox: Footprint calculator There are many different Footprint calculators available, on vast numbers of Web sites."

Cecil has been riding motor bikes since he was a kid. Rugged trails in Oregon required rugged equipment. Problem was--there wasn't equipment available that was rugged enough. The metal boxes and racks, for example, would break. Plus, they added weight which made the bikes unstable. So his first product was the Giant Loop Saddlebag made of ballistic nylon. It was horseshoe-shaped and wrapped around behind the seat, bolting to the plastic fender and side panels of the bike. Because his designs position weight closer to the center of the bike, it added stability. Giant Loop now has 25 products, ranging in price from $16 to $700.

Having a disability significantly affected the ability of Syrian children and adolescents to attend school , with almost half ( 44 per cent ) of children with disabilities indicating that they cannot attend school due to their condition .	Lebanon: Prioritizing protection for people with disabilities A vulnerability assessment of Syrian refugees in Lebanon found that two thirds of households had at least one member with a specific need, and 12 per cent of households had at least one member with a disability. Children with disabilities were among the most marginalized groups in Lebanon. Having a disability significantly affected the ability of Syrian children and adolescents to attend school, with almost half (44 per cent) of children with disabilities indicating that they cannot attend school due to their condition. Despite this, the specific needs of refugees with disabilities remained largely unaddressed, and women, girls and boys with disabilities are at a higher risk of violence, abuse and exploitation. Given their significant protection needs, the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund (LHF) has established protection as a priority for its allocation strategies. Since January 2018, 32 per cent ($7 million) of LHF funding has been allocated to projects aimed at increasing access to protection services, including by providing case management and specialized services for children with disabilities. 79 WHO and World Bank, World Report on Disability (2011).

Promote the enrolment of persons with disabilities into mainstream education .	There is an urgent need to improve access to education for persons with disabilities because educational disadvantage could lead to higher rates of social exclusion and poverty and therefore have long-term implications for their capacity to participate in the labour force. The disability education gap could undermine the achievement of Goal 4 as well as other SDGs. To achieve Goal 4 for persons with disabilities, in line with the CRPD, more political commitment and efforts are needed, particularly in implementing and scaling up the following actions: 1) Strengthen national policies and the legal system to ensure access to quality education for all persons with disabilities. Ensure that national legal and policy frameworks reflect the rights of persons with disabilities to education and eliminate discriminatory policies and laws. Promote the enrolment of persons with disabilities into mainstream education. Carry out educational system reforms, with a view to promote inclusive education and to ensure equal learning opportunities. This would also help prevent risks of segregation and contribute to ensuring a truly inclusive learning environment for all. 2) Build the capacity of policymakers as well other decision makers at both the community and national levels to enhance their knowledge of the educational needs of persons with disabilities and to identify and implement strategies on inclusive education. 3) Make schools and educational facilities accessible by creating an enabling environment for students with disabilities and by making physical and virtual environments accessible. It is essential that students with disabilities can access all school buildings and other educational and recreational facilities, including classrooms, common rooms, libraries, dining areas, toilets and playgrounds. Universal Design, a set of principles that can be applied in the construction or refurbishment of buildings, should be used as a guide for improving school accessibility as well as analysing the current situation in schools.

Expertise in data collection, software development and modeling has been gained in UFL13 and NCS19. UGA28 has contributed to improved transformation techniques resulting in greater recovery of transgenic plants with better fertility. TAM17 has refined the introgression of useful traits from wild species, the identification of markers for useful traits, fatty acid and oil quality assay capabilities, and molecular biological techniques. FAM51 has characterized biochemical responses to drought and has identified drought-resistant genotypes. Screening techniques have been improved, and markers for identification of drought tolerant genotypes have been identified. Proteins are being evaluated for their anti-microbial activity against Aspergillus flavus. Items of equipment have been made available to some host countries and include vehicles, computers, digital cameras, and Global Positioning Systems (UFL13 and NCS19). In addition, labor saving devices for planting, harvesting, and shelling peanuts have been supplied to collaborators in Senegal, Ghana, Guyana, and Bolivia. 2.2.4 technology transfer. A significant improvement in technology transfer has been apparent during this second phase of the program. Notable achievements are the adoption of improved production practices extended through field days, workshops and farmer training activities in countries such as Ghana (UFL13 and NCS19), and Bolivia (UFL16) where yields have been increased two-fold. In Guyana (UFL52) the CRSP presence has resulted in a dramatic increase in area planted and production (five fold). The use of farmers as trainers is a very positive development, notably in Ghana (UFL13 and NCS19), Bolivia (UFL16) and in Guyana (UFL52) following farmer field school methodology.

India was the pioneer, but other countries--Brazil, Chile, China, and Malaysia, to name a few--have also seized the opportunity.72 The obvious winners of job migration are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered service jobs have migrated. This migration, along with the transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and higher living standards. The hidden winners of job migration are consumers worldwide. The improved international division of labor increases the availability of goods and services and enhances the possibility of gaining from trade. The clear losers are those who have seen their jobs disappear because of the declining competitiveness of their industries and services. Among the losers, many skilled workers find comparable jobs without a substantial loss in salary, but oth- and expertise. Social effects are more mixed. On the positive side, migration connects people from different cultures in ways bound to widen their horizons. On the negative side, the separation from family and friends can be a source of distress and isolation. Migration may also bring racial prejudice and heighten social tensions in host countries, especially when migrants are secluded in segregated occupations or neighborhoods, preventing their integration in society.

"Warda is an autonomous Intergovernmental Research Association of 17 countries in West and Central Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. WARDA was founded in 1970. Since 1986, WARDA has also been a member of the CGIAR. WARDA's mission is ""to contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in poor rural and urban populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, through research, partnerships, capacity strengthening, and policy support on rice-based systems, and in ways that promote sustainable agricultural development based on environmentally sound management of natural resources."" Rice is a unique and highly political commodity in Africa. Because of its ease of preparation, low preparation costs, low price, and steady supplies (through imports), rice consumption is increasing rapidly, providing food security for Africa's poor. Because of its large genetic diversity, it tolerates extreme soil and weather conditions, allowing farmers to produce food in adverse environments. Rice is also an integrating crop. Rice development often acts as an entry point for the development of the agricultural sector as a whole by enhancing household food security, reducing production risk, enhancing income, and averting natural resource degradation. WARDA will therefore seek to contribute to poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa through integrated sustainable development of the rice sector, particularly through technology development. WARDA's ultimate beneficiaries are rice producers and consumers in West and Central Africa. WARDA's more immediate beneficiaries are its research and development collaborators, such as national agricultural research and extension systems and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)."

This facilitates efficient and consistent data collec7on of workers ' interviews , enables data reten7on and tracking of factories ' working condi7ons over 7me .	There are many challenges in the social audi7ng process such as 7me constraints during factory visits; lack of privacy during interviews; workers appearing to be coached and not feeling safe enough to speak out; communica7on barriers; and a lack of consistent analysis methods. Auditors rarely cover ILO indicators of forced labour in a comprehensive and consistent manner during worker interviews. These issues result in an overall lack of frequency, privacy, confiden7ality, and consistency in workers' interviews during social compliance audits. These issues deeply affect workers' possibility to speak out and auditors' capability to iden7fy indicators of labour exploita7on during factory visits. This results in vic7ms and exploita7ve factories remaining unno7ced. By providing a summary of workers' feedback in real-7me, the app highlights areas for further inves7ga7on. It also allows auditors to reach out to more workers and bridge language barriers through its mul7lingual audio-ques7onnaires. Data collected through the app can be collated on a content management system, and screening responses can be accessed, analysed, and shared by authorized users and their organiza7ons.

Decree 15 provides new guidance on registrations , announcements , certificates , labels , advertisements , working conditions , origins of food and food additives , and jurisdiction for food safety issues .	On February 2, 2018, Vietnam adopted Decree 15 on the enforcement of the Food Safety Law (replacing the original Law known as Decree 38, which was issued in 2012). Decree 15 provides new guidance on registrations, announcements, certificates, labels, advertisements, working conditions, origins of food and food additives, and jurisdiction for food safety issues. Although the Decree simplifies many of the import procedures for food and agricultural products, uncertainty remains on many of its aspects. Different Vietnamese government ministries, and even departments within MARD, appear to contradict each other regarding the interpretation of the Decree. For example, several MARD departments have different definitions for which products can be considered a processed food. Additionally, although Decree 15 permits simplified sampling to be performed for imports meeting certain safety requirements, discrepancies within the Vietnamese government appear to prohibit such allowances, contradicting the spirit of the Decree. Another area of concern is the transfer of authority to propose maximum residue limits (MRLs) for food safety from Vietnam's Ministry of Health (MOH) to MARD, although MOH will continue to officially authorize MRLs. As a result, the United States does not yet know if the new Decree will resolve outstanding U.S. concerns, primarily related to uneven enforcement and lack of transparency, on the original Food Safety Law. Despite requests by the United States and other trading partners, Vietnam has refused to notify the Decree to the WTO to allow for comments on the Decree. The United States will continue to monitor developments of this new regulation.

Social distancing-based public health interventions , such as mass quarantines , extensive travel bans , and transportation system disruption , can shock the economy and shrink the market demand in the service sectors that are critical for many SMEs that rely on visits by regular customers .	1. Social distancing-based public health interventions, such as mass quarantines, extensive travel bans, and transportation system disruption, can shock the economy and shrink the market demand in the service sectors that are critical for many SMEs that rely on visits by regular customers. When considering using these interventions, the cost on SMEs should be considered. 2. SMEs are financially more fragile and cash-strapped when market demand is down. Emergency funding programs that target SMEs could be one important component of a response. Lower interest rates, deferred or waived taxes and fees, or easier lending policies could also help SMEs stay afloat during the period of low market demand. Congress has begun to take actions through supplemental appropriations to address some of the financial challenges of SMEs. The Federal Reserve Bank's recent lending rate cut will also support SMEs. 3. SMEs could benefit from diversifying business platforms. Online-based platforms and virtual service provisions can help SMEs sustain business during quarantines or travel bans. It would be helpful if policymakers could bring tax breaks and technical guidance to help SMEs restructure their business operations. 4. China is currently putting the disease prevention burden on SMEs. This may further stress SMEs. The U.S. public health system could have a hotline or website to provide SMEs with information on the epidemic, disease prevention methods, PPE resources, and testing sites (or provide mobile testing). 5. The U.S. government could consider setting aside additional funding for unemployment insurance payments in the event that SMEs affected by the COVID-19 are forced to lay off employees. 6. Additional emergency funding could be considered to help SMEs avoid bankruptcy or help the creditors of bankrupt SMEs.

Annex1 : Socio-economics, Gender and Policy Projects - 61 - Knowledge of methods used in conducting economic analysis was gained through the use of the new software and interactive exchange visits to Alabama and Bulgaria. Plans for producing publications were developed. The PIs jointly arrived at the realization that analytical tools necessary for this project would need to be rebuilt based on assumptions appropriate for a noncentrally controlled economy. Also, assumptions relative to farm unit size and managerial capabilities of the new farm owners would need to be retooled. Hence, technology transfer and technology transformation would result from the CRSP endeavor. ENEA was enabled to inaugurate better collection and use of farm level data, including the use of coding and data entry. This process became repeatable on a yearly basis and the focus shifted to a more rigorous system of data analysis. This new capability at data management has been used to increase the production of technical papers to disseminate the results. The papers encompass a range of topics, including the impact of technical innovation through new varieties, the pricing and marketing of agricultural products (peanut), optimizing farm planning and poverty levels, technical efficiencies in peanut production/processing, and a range of descriptive analyses. On the U.S. side of the technical benefits/achievements ledger, there were several outcomes: The University of Connecticut (UCONN) PI and his assistants gained additional experience in collecting, managing and analyzing data in situations with developing country conditions imposed.

Now, more than at any other time in history, we have more information on migration and displacement globally at our disposal. And yet, the very nature of migration in an interconnected world means that its dynamism can be difficult to capture in statistical terms. Migration involves ""events"" that can be fast-paced and complex. While it is certainly true that international migration patterns are related to social, economic and geopolitical processes that have evolved over generations, if not hundreds of years, recent advances in transnational connectivity are opening up more opportunities for greater diversity in migration processes."

Most provide some indication of costing, and several governments have reached out to development partners for financial and technical support.

Fourth, global demand for Coted'Ivoire's agricultural export commodities points to continuing opportunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. The extent to which Engel's Law acts as a constraint on the demand for a country's agricultural products (and labor), depends also on the tradability of its agriculture, the evolution of global (as opposed to domestic) demand, and the country's comparative advantage. The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity, the less constrained the country is by domestic demand and the larger is its agriculture's potential for generating jobs. The production and export of cash crops, especially cocoa, but also of coffee, cotton, and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Coted'Ivoire's economy and job creation. They also feed other sectors of the economy, particularly agro-processing, commerce, and transportation and contribute importantly to formal wage job creation, many of them low skilled (Chapter5).

In 2015 , the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to 16 .	Participation in primary education has been negatively affected by the crisis between 2002 and 2011 and Coted'Ivoire has not yet fully caught up with other countries in the region.106 Before 2002 Coted'Ivoire was almost on par with average primary education enrollment rates for developing countries in Sub-Saharan African. However, the gross enrollment rate (GER), which measures total enrollment relative to the primary age population, has deteriorated from 2002. In 2002 gross enrollment was 77 percent and it decreased to as low as 70 percent in 2007. While there was some catch-up in enrollment during the years of peace between 2008 and 2010, where the rate stepped back up to around 73 percent, the most significant improvement came after 2011 when the rate increased to 90 percent by 2014. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to 16. This should help close the gap in enrollment rates with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa, where the GER in primary education was 99.6 percent in 2013. In fact, some patterns in inequality in access to education are more pronounced in Coted'Ivoire than other Sub-Saharan African developing countries, and addressing access and enrollment in basic education remains an important policy consideration to ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school.

Unusually small gender gaps in life expectancy for a given level of mortality are observed in Eastern and Southern Asia. This suggests unequal gender norms and discriminatory practices. Eastern Asia has the second narrowest gender gap among regions (2.8 years) in a context of high life expectancy at birth (the third highest for women and second highest for men among all regions). Over the past 20 years, the gender gap in life expectancy in Eastern Asia has diminished slightly as a result of a much steeper increase in life expectancy for men than women.

"Warda is an autonomous Intergovernmental Research Association of 17 countries in West and Central Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. WARDA was founded in 1970. Since 1986, WARDA has also been a member of the CGIAR. WARDA's mission is ""to contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in poor rural and urban populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, through research, partnerships, capacity strengthening, and policy support on rice-based systems, and in ways that promote sustainable agricultural development based on environmentally sound management of natural resources."" Rice is a unique and highly political commodity in Africa. Because of its ease of preparation, low preparation costs, low price, and steady supplies (through imports), rice consumption is increasing rapidly, providing food security for Africa's poor. Because of its large genetic diversity, it tolerates extreme soil and weather conditions, allowing farmers to produce food in adverse environments. Rice is also an integrating crop. Rice development often acts as an entry point for the development of the agricultural sector as a whole by enhancing household food security, reducing production risk, enhancing income, and averting natural resource degradation. WARDA will therefore seek to contribute to poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa through integrated sustainable development of the rice sector, particularly through technology development. WARDA's ultimate beneficiaries are rice producers and consumers in West and Central Africa. WARDA's more immediate beneficiaries are its research and development collaborators, such as national agricultural research and extension systems and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)."

The current Peanut CRSP Grant began in 1996 with program adjustments made in 2001 based on the 2000 EEP Review. The peanut CRSP uses a value-chain approach developed around five thematic or cluster areas: (1) food safety and nutrition; (2) production efficiency; (3) socioeconomics and policy; (4) Post-Harvest and utilization; and (5) information, training and technology transfer and management. Program content assured that the Title XII expectations of impact in the host (developing) countries with benefits to the United States (U.S.A.) would be achieved. Plans were developed to resolve major constraints to the host countries and U.S.A. peanut sector and to ensure that social and gender issues were addressed. This 2004-2005 review concluded that the Peanut CRSP had been highly effective in developing technologies through research in the five thematic/cluster areas, and the technologies transferred to farmers, entrepreneurs, and key stakeholders have resulted in significant impacts in the host countries and the U.S.A. The Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree training, short-term training of host country scientists, and training of peanut farmers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders was important to technology transfer and is a major impact of the program. Institutional capacity has been developed. Information was made available worldwide through various media. Web-based program and fiscal management has been efficient and costeffective.

As in Brazil , this recent experience from Mozambique underscores once again that more and better jobs from large-scale commercial agricultural production units remain often far and few between .	Smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation. Smallholders in Coted'Ivoire are relatively well endowed with land and hire labor (including from abroad) to make up for family labor shortages. There are no signs that larger farmers in Coted'Ivoire are more efficient than smaller ones (Figure3.10). Recent, rigorous assessment of the (short-term) spillover effects from new large farm establishments in Mozambique also points to limited beneficial effects on neighboring smallholders within 25 to 50 kilometers.68 The limited indirect effects reported in Mozambique are furthermore limited to the adoption of better agronomic practices and accessing modern inputs, but were not found to extend to employment generation or output market participation and are counterbalanced by a decrease in perceived welfare.

Inland valleys have a key role to play in providing options for sustainable intensification and diversification of agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa .	Inland valleys have a key role to play in providing options for sustainable intensification and diversification of agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Soils in lowland ecosystems are the least fragile and best able to support continuous cultivation. The soils in many valley bottoms retain residual moisture well after an initial flooded rice crop, permitting two crops per year, or aquaculture when base flow lasts long enough. The hydromorphic fringes and upland slopes and crests offer potential for other food and cash crops, and for trees and livestock. Thus, inland valleys constitute an important agricultural and hydrological asset at the local and national level, and can make a major contribution to future food security and poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In reality the recognition by a protected area management authority of protected areas owned/managed by indigenous communities is often linked to a community's response to an external threat to their traditional ownership/management. Becoming part of a network can help secure rights and ensure continuity of livelihoods and traditions. This process of 'formal' recognition can simplify the process of ensuring a site meets the definition of a protected area, assigning the category and having the site recorded within national and international data on protected area. The Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) of Australia, for example, used the categories system from the onset; the advantages of this were perceived by all parties. As IUCN recorded in a review of the use of the categories in 2004, 'Indigenous groups ... liked the idea of adopting an internationally recognised system because they felt it reinforced their status as legitimate protected area managers and thus engaged them into an internationally significant agenda, something they have struggled to achieve in Australia. From other stakeholders' perspective (i.e. government and NGOs) the IUCN category system gave the IPA concept more credibility and parity with the mainstream protected area system and so their criticisms were somewhat diminished. From the perspective of the Commonwealth government, who are the funders and promoters of the initiative, it also gave greater confidence that IPAs were worth investing in with scarce conservation dollars' (Bishop et al., 2004, pages 142-143). Other examples of the use of the protected areas concept to maintain traditional human societies can be found in Stolton and Dudley, 2010.

The increased production already achieved has stimulated the industry, and raised interest in exports.

Public sector entities are also obliged to undertake accessibility audits, and develop and implement plans to realize the right to accessibility, which is called for by the CRPD ""to ensure that private entities that offer facilities and services which are open or provided to the public take into account all aspects of accessibility for persons with disabilities"" (article 9, paragraph 2(b)). States Parties must take all appropriate measures to urge private entities to make information and services available in accessible formats for persons with disabilities (article 21, paragraph (c)). The CRPD also includes a provision for access to a range of in-home, residential and in community support services (article 19, paragraph (b)), and the equal availability of services and facilities for general populations on an equal basis to persons with disabilities (article 19, paragraph (c)).

This became a rallying cry for challenging victim blaming and holding offenders to account .	"Following sexual harassment allegations against US Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and others in the show business industry, millions of women worldwide used the online hashtag #MeToo to break the silence about their experiences as survivors of sexual violence. This became a rallying cry for challenging victim blaming and holding offenders to account. The year also saw the women's and feminist movements mobilizing thousands - including during January's Women's Marches across Europe, and Black Monday protests in Poland that successfully pushed the government not to further restrict access to safe and legal abortion. Yet, throughout Europe and Central Asia, women and girls continued to experience systemic human rights violations and abuses, including torture and other ill-treatment, denial of the right to health and bodily autonomy, inequality of opportunity, and widespread gender-based violence. Access to abortion remained criminalized in most circumstances in Ireland and Northern Ireland and severely restricted in practice. In Poland, there were systemic barriers in accessing safe and legal abortion. Abortion remained criminalized in all circumstances in Malta. The EU and Moldova signed the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention). It was ratified by Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Norway and Switzerland - bringing to 28 the number of states to have done so. Ukraine signed it in 2011 but failed to ratify the Convention. Despite increasingly strong legislative protections, gender-based violence against women remained pervasive, including in Albania, Croatia and Romania. In Russia, under the cover of the so-called ""traditional values"" narrative, and encountering little public criticism, the Parliament adopted legislationdecriminalizing some forms of domestic violence whichPresident Putin signed into law. In Norway and Sweden, gender-based violence, including sexual violence, remained a serious problem with inadequate state response."

OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 3 This technical paper was written by researchers from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) to document the piloting and development of the WEAI so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings. The index evolved in late 2010 and early 2011 out of discussions among US government agencies involved in the Feed the Future Initiative regarding the need for an indicator to monitor women's empowerment. The discussions initially revolved around using a gender perceptions index but eventually focused on an index similar to the multidimensional poverty indexes being developed by OPHI. Following the definition of 5DE in agriculture by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), work began at IFPRI in June-July 2011 to develop questionnaire modules that could be used to elicit responses on each of these domains. The full survey--with household and individual questionnaires, administered to a primary male and a primary female respondent in each household 4 --was piloted from September to November 2011 in Feed the Future zones of influence in Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda. Index development took place from November 2011 to January 2012. Qualitative interviews and case studies with individuals, as well as a technical consultation with outside experts in January 2012, provided further input into the choice of indicators that comprise the index. The WEAI itself was launched on February 28, 2012, at the 56th session of the Committee on the Status of Women at the United Nations, New York, and subsequently in three separate presentations in March in London, New Delhi, and Washington, DC.

Mobile clinics , testing , and identifying resources to help patient care and isolation are necessary .	1. Learn the lesson of a wrong epidemiology case definition: The delay in identifying the nature of the epidemic in Wuhan was partly due to an overly narrow epidemiologic case definition--a case definition that posited a direct connection to the seafood market (that was associated with the first few cases). An epidemiology case definition that does not reflect the actual transmission routes will provide a false sense of security that obscures the real epidemic. The United States' testing policy in January and February that narrowly focused on a travel history to China when other countries already had cases fell into the same category of mistake. 2. A concerted public health effort is needed: Social distancing policies--mass quarantines, travel bans, or case tracing policies--should be combined with large health investments, technology-and data-supported surveillance, and high-level government commitment early on to effectively stop the transmissions. Taiwan's 100 percent travel registration at the border and tracing, Taiwan's and Singapore's mandatory self-quarantine with rigorous reinforcement, and large-scale population-level testing with ample medical resources (e.g., Singapore opened 800 public health clinics for a population of 5 million) are good examples of effective policies. 3. Risk communication and coordination are important: Both the public and the health care sector will need well-planned, persistent, and targeted risk communication to help prevent the hysteria associated with an acute outbreak. The U.S. government should have a hotline or a centralized broadcast source for the public to ask questions and clarify disinformation. Mobile clinics, testing, and identifying resources to help patient care and isolation are necessary. PPEs and essential health care equipment should be well inventoried, and the distribution should be coordinated. 4. Health care surge capacity needs to be estimated: Gaps can be met using temporary space (conference centers, hotels, large gyms, military bases, etc.) that can be converted to temporary quarantine locations for cases with mild symptoms. Hospitals and clinics should consider how to separate the potential infection zones from the regular patient areas.

This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across sectors , firm types , and over time .	This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across sectors, firm types, and over time. It also explores how the wage growth path is related to labor productivity and other firm-level characteristics. The analysis helps answer the following questions: (a) Are wages higher in large or small firms, firms creating jobs versus non-job creators? (b) Do wages increase with productivity, including productivity within firms and across sector? (c) How does this wage-productivity relationship vary by the extent of market competition? First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in wages across and within sectors, even after accounting for skill composition. Not surprisingly, most sectors pay better than agriculture. Somewhat unexpectedly, the food manufacturing sector has one of the lowest average wage. The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23) are by far the highest-paying sectors. Those in the public sector (75) are also among the highest-paying jobs, lending support to the argument that in many developing countries including Coted'Ivoire, high public wages might impose a wage floor effect for skilled workers in the private sector. This observation is consistent with the finding in Chapter1 that for the more educated --those at least upper-secondary education --public jobs are more prevalent that private wage employment in the formal sector.

Education is a fundamental human right and an essential condition for individual development and full and effective participation in society. However, too many persons with disabilities continue to be denied this fundamental right due to numerous barriers and obstacles to accessible education, including prejudice and discrimination against those with disabilities, the lack of qualified teachers to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities as well as inaccessible schools and educational materials. Lack of disaggregated data and research also impede the development of effective policies and programmes to promote inclusive education. Available evidence shows that persons with disabilities are less likely to attend school, less likely to complete primary or secondary education, and less likely to be literate.

This is largely due to increased investment in primary education and measures taken such as the abolishment of school fees .	Participation in primary education is nearly universal Between 1990 and 2012, primary education was extended to an ever increasing proportion of the world's children. Over that period, substantial progress was made towards universal primary education, with the global adjusted net enrolment rate7 in primary education rising from 77 to 90 per cent for girls and from 87 to 92 per cent for boys (figure 3.2). The enrolment of girls in primary education has increased faster than that of boys, which helped to close the gender gap at the primary level. This is particularly true in those regions where girls' enrolment rates were historically much lower than that of boys. Outstanding gains in primary enrolment have been registered in developing regions, particularly in Northern and sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Asia and Oceania. This is largely due to increased investment in primary education and measures taken such as the abolishment of school fees. However, many countries in some of these regions are still far from attaining universal primary education. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite an impressive increase of 27 and 22 percentage points for girls and boys, respectively, over the period 1990-2012, only 75 per cent of primaryschool-aged girls and 81 per cent of boys of the same age attended school in 2012. In developed 7 The adjusted net enrolment rate is the percentage of children of official primary school age who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education. The indicator is commonly used to assess the level of achievement of the universal primary education goal and to measure the school participation of the official primary-school-age population.

"There are several reasons why taking the longer-run, dynamic perspective makes sense. Economists know that research and development generates spillovers because firms often can only partly appropriate the gains it brings. For example, once a patent expires, any firm can take advantage of the associated innovation. There may also be cases where engineering and managerial improvements from producing a new technology lower the technology's costs (often called ""learning by doing""), and some of the cost reductions may spill over to other firms. For instance, there is evidence that firms in the semiconductor industry lowered their production costs as they produced more of each generation of semiconductors and that these lowered costs spilled over to other firms (Irwin and Klenow 1994). There may also be positive network effects, with benefits to society from the adoption of a single standard, such as one plug that works for charging all electric vehicles. All three types of spillovers allow other firms to reduce costs, improving social welfare and providing an economic motivation for carefully designed policies to foster such spillovers."

Migrants are rarely included in relevant planning mechanisms, with significant impacts on migrant and host communities alike.

Both these labor supply and demand side perspectives on the role of agriculture would suggest that increasing labor productivity during the structural transformation should mainly happen through a reduction of the agricultural labor force and that to do so, policies should especially focus on removing barriers to sectoral (and spatial) migration. Yet, even though popular, there are a number of important caveats to these perspectives. For example, recent evidence indicates that the frequently cited agricultural productivity gap measures based on the national accounts abstract from a series of confounding factors and measurement issues, which exaggerate the gap. This suggests that the gains from sectoral movements, and thus the incentives to move, may not be as large as commonly purported. Furthermore, the view that labor is less productive in agriculture --a viewpoint that is especially well established in macro policy circles --has often also been taken as evidence that labor in agriculture is intrinsically less productive, and thus less worthy of investment. This sits oddly with the agricultural success stories of agro-exporters such as the United States and the Netherlands, and more recently also Vietnam, Chile, and Peru.

For example , companies can develop new green products and energy technologies that humanity will need in the future .	The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), an organization that represents many of the world's most influential corporations, has launched Vision 2050 to identify the pathways toward a one-planet economy in the next four decades. Global Footprint Network participated in a yearlong process to provide a framework for thinking about resource constraints, as well as to quantify whether the proposed pathways and scenarios are robust enough to achieve a oneplanet economy by 2050. In collaboration with companies such as Boeing, Syngenta and Weyerhaeuser (which are providing data on energy, cropland efficiency and forest productivity, respectively) Global Footprint Network developed a calculator to test whether the solutions and innovations proposed by the group of 35 participating companies are up to scale with the level of change needed. The emerging consensus was that the pathways toward a sustainable world will require fundamental changes in governance structures, economic frameworks, business and human behavior. The companies found that not only are these changes necessary, they are feasible and offer tremendous business opportunities for those companies that incorporate sustainability into their strategies. For example, companies can develop new green products and energy technologies that humanity will need in the future.

WARDA 's ultimate beneficiaries are rice producers and consumers in West and Central Africa .	"Warda is an autonomous Intergovernmental Research Association of 17 countries in West and Central Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. WARDA was founded in 1970. Since 1986, WARDA has also been a member of the CGIAR. WARDA's mission is ""to contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in poor rural and urban populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, through research, partnerships, capacity strengthening, and policy support on rice-based systems, and in ways that promote sustainable agricultural development based on environmentally sound management of natural resources."" Rice is a unique and highly political commodity in Africa. Because of its ease of preparation, low preparation costs, low price, and steady supplies (through imports), rice consumption is increasing rapidly, providing food security for Africa's poor. Because of its large genetic diversity, it tolerates extreme soil and weather conditions, allowing farmers to produce food in adverse environments. Rice is also an integrating crop. Rice development often acts as an entry point for the development of the agricultural sector as a whole by enhancing household food security, reducing production risk, enhancing income, and averting natural resource degradation. WARDA will therefore seek to contribute to poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa through integrated sustainable development of the rice sector, particularly through technology development. WARDA's ultimate beneficiaries are rice producers and consumers in West and Central Africa. WARDA's more immediate beneficiaries are its research and development collaborators, such as national agricultural research and extension systems and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)."

Different members of the same household tend to be engaged in similar types of activities , so that households are fairly specialized in wage employment , nonagricultural self-employment , or agricultural self-employment .	Although many individuals cumulate several activities, there is little diversification in employment types within households. Different members of the same household tend to be engaged in similar types of activities, so that households are fairly specialized in wage employment, nonagricultural self-employment, or agricultural self-employment. For instance, 40.2 percent of households are engaged in agricultural self-employment only, 21.1 percent in nonagricultural self-employment only, and 18.2 percent in wage employment only. Only about 20 percent of households have members in different employment types. The most common diversification pattern combines wage employment and nonagricultural self-employment (9.5 percent of households nationally), followed by nonagricultural self-employment and agricultural employment (8.9 percent of households nationally). Diversification patterns differ in urban and rural areas (Figure1.11). Rural households do not combine many agricultural activities with nonagricultural activities, although, of course, there is substantial diversification within agriculture itself, such as combination of cash and food crops, agriculture and livestock (see discussion in Chapter3). Urban households are slightly more diversified, mostly through nonagricultural self-employment.

Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries , because poor people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in agriculture than in the growth in other sectors .	Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries, because poor people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.8 Since 1700, virtually every example of mass poverty reduction has actually begun with an increase in agricultural productivity.9 Constraints on agricultural growth vary depending on the availability of land relative to the availability of farm labor. Compared with other areas of the developing world, SubSaharan Africa was traditionally seen as a continent of ample land and scarce labor. While that may still be true in some areas, it no longer applies to countries in the south and east of the continent. In Mozambique, the average farm size is less than 1.5 hectares. As the area under cultivation declines relative to the size of the population, producing sufficient food becomes a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place. In many agrarian economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have yet to occur. Unlike many parts of Asia, where the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield and the poverty incidence has declined, cereal yield has remained low and poverty incidence high in these Sub-Saharan countries (figure 6.1). Some Asian economies, such as Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Myanmar, face similar challenges.	Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries, because poor people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.

Sometimes, private tutoring is reported to have a negative effect on mainstream classes. Writing about Kuwait, Hussein (1987) stated that: ""Tutoring has caused a great lack of interest on the part of students.

Falling oil prices also pass through into other commodity prices, in particular food prices: a 45 percent decline in global oil prices could reduce agricultural commodity prices by about 10 percent as discussed above. Changes in global food commodity prices will also be reflected in most countries' domestic food prices--even if only with a lag and muted by transport cost and local supply and demand conditions (World Bank 2014c; Cudjoe, Breisinger and Diao 2010).15 Falling food prices may benefit the majority of the poor but harm the very poorest, despite an adjustment in household behavior. Many poor households are net food buyers--and would thus benefit from lower food prices. In low-income countries, however, about half of the poor households are only marginal net food buyers and the poorest households tend to be net food sellers (Aksoy and IsikDikmelik 2008). Hence, while the bulk of the poor may benefit from low food prices, the poorest may see net real income losses. However, poor households will likely mitigate some of the impact of falling food prices by adjusting the hours worked or the number of household members working in employment outside the family farm (Ivanic and Martin 2014).

Operationally, in the case of Coted'Ivoire, existing literature on informality indicates that the country follows the ILO framework elaborated above. However, the predominant way to define informality is based on the registration criterion, and slightly less on the size criterion. Indeed, from both approaches (enterprise or labor), being in informality implies that the operating entity or employee is not registered with the Government Social Security Office (Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance Sociale or CNPS). The rationale is that registration with the social security office is generally the last administrative step to establish an enterprise or declaring an employee in Coted'Ivoire, while often preceding steps of formalization are juridical or fiscal natures (AGEPE 2011). Throughout this chapter, nonagricultural household enterprises are defined as in Filmer et al. (2014). The terms nonagricultural household enterprises or simply household enterprises or informal sector are used interchangeably.

Another would be to assess the economic viability of crops other than tobacco with a lesser environmental impact .	This overview calls for a more comprehensive analysis of the environmental effects of the life cycle of tobacco, including cigarette production, trade and disposal. One way to do this is to use economic modelling to include environmental costs in the overall costs of the tobacco trade. Another would be to assess the economic viability of crops other than tobacco with a lesser environmental impact. To achieve the first, a variant of a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis of the effect of the tobacco trade on the environment could be created. Indicators of environmental concerns could be incorporated into these existing models to add an environmental component. By using the results of CGE modelling (alongside established cost-benefit methodologies), environmental effects could be costed (while offsetting other effects) in order to arrive at a figure on the net costs of tobacco and cigarette production that takes account of environmental impact.

Reforms in the cocoa sector have already resulted in asignificant increase in production (from 1.2 million tons in 2009/10 to 1.8 million tons during the 2014/15 campaign). Diversification and expansion into newer crops, such as labor-intensive cashew (especially since the early 2000s), and adding value, through further processing, also hold a lot of potential for jobs. Since the mid-1990s, cashew production in Coted'Ivoire has seen massive expansion. It became the world's leading exporter of (unshelled) cashew nuts in 2002 and more than quadrupled its production since, to over 426,000 tons in 2013. But for now, only around 6 percent of its cashew nuts are processed domestically. The government's target is to bring this to 50 percent by 2020. Increasing locally generated added value in cashew, but also cotton, could be critical for jobs. Both are grown in the central and northern parts of the country, which house many of the poor and have been hit hard by the longstanding multifaceted crisis.

Ecuador imposes a variety of standards-related measures on certain types of processed food. Executive Decree No. 4522 of 2013 of the Ministry of Public Health's (MSP) National Agency for Regulation, 144 | FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS Control, and Sanitary Surveillance, requires that all processed and packaged food products include a label with a set of colored bars indicating low, medium, or high content of salt, sugar, and fat. Although the government of Ecuador revoked in November 2018 a resolution, COMEX 116, that would require a certificate demonstrating compliance with the labeling provisions, it remains unclear what a transition phase will look like for labeling and conformity assessment of imported food and agricultural products. Implementation of this requirement reduced the imports of dozens of high value added food products from the United States, including preserved meat and vegetable products, jams, sauces, and other food products, because certification is more onerous for imports than for domestic products. In addition, processed food products of animal origin require prior authorization from three government agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, including the animal and plant health authority AGROCALIDAD, the Undersecretary of Commercialization, and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development. For processed meat products, an assessment is conducted by both the Undersecretary of Commercialization and the Undersecretary of Livestock Development, resulting in unnecessary redundancy and delay. The United States will continue to work with Ecuadorian authorities to explore alternatives, including the use of state or federal Certificates of Free Sale, a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity, or a determination of equivalence with the Ecuadorian Service for Standardization's (INEN) requirements.

For the next four years, we assume a return of 10.1%, corresponding to the average for the world as a whole. For education beyond the 8th year, we assume estimated OECD average returns of 6.8%.

"Chile remained on the Priority Watch List in the 2018 Special 301 Report. The United States remains concerned about the adequacy and effectiveness of the protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights under Chile's system. In 2018, Chile took a step forward by passing a new law, in force since November 2018, providing for protection and enforcement against certain aspects of piracy that occurs through satellite signal theft. The law establishes penalties for the importation, commercialization, and distribution of illegal decoding devices used to steal encrypted program-carrying signals. However, longstanding concerns remain in relation to the lack of effective remedies to address the unlawful circumvention of technological protection measures, failure to ratify the (1991) Act of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV '91), and an ineffective Internet Service Provider liability regime, which has failed to promote effective and expeditious action against online piracy. The United States also has urged Chile to address concerns about pharmaceutical related intellectual property, including gaps in its existing mechanism for early resolution of patent disputes (called ""patent linkage""), as well as the need for adequate protection against unfair commercial use of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval. In addition, the United States is monitoring administrative actions and proposed legislation in Chile that may weaken exclusive patent rights for pharmaceutical products. The U.S. government remains committed to engaging with Chile on this issue. The United States will continue to work bilaterally with Chile to address these and other IP issues."

The spatial concentration of activity is a strong driver of productivity growth in developing countries. Effects can materialize within sectors (localization economies) or between sectors (urbanization economies). The sharing of inputs, better labor matching, and knowledge spillovers are the main forces behind the geographical concentration of industries and economic activity in urban environments. The sharing of inputs facilitates the emergence of specialized producers of intermediate goods and services. Proximity allows firms to more easily find workers to fill positions.

According to the national employment survey collected in February 2014 , over 50 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 34 lack a complete primary education .	In light of the historical enrollment patterns, educational attainment remains modest among the youth of working age in Coted'Ivoire. According to the national employment survey collected in February 2014, over 50 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 34 lack a complete primary education. Approximately 37.5 percent have no education and 17.5 percent have not completed primary school. This reflects the low primary enrollment rates over the last 30 years --for example, in the early 1990s gross enrollment was below 70 percent. So while enrollment rates have improved, there is still a deficit of human capital in the current working-age population, even among those in the younger cohorts. Recent improvements in enrollment will benefit the next generations of youths entering the working-age population, and the overall education profile of the working-age population will take time to change substantially.

Results Overview As has been an ongoing trend over the last four years, T&T competitiveness continues to improve worldwide, and connectivity enabling--and enabled by--the industry remains on an upward path. The TTCI 2019 results show that air transportation, digital connectivity and international openness are advancing in a global context of growing trade tensions and nationalism. Air transport infrastructure improvements show a noticeable increase on route capacity and the number of airlines providing services in individual countries. International openness is progressing, with lower-income economies leading the way. Digital connectivity has been bolstered by a growing number of individuals using the internet and mobile internet subscriptions, meaning more economies are now in a position to leverage the growing list of digital T&T services. Travel has also become, for the most part, less expensive and safer, with the Price Competitiveness pillar, for example, showing the greatest percentage increase since 2017. Lastly, T&T is increasingly being prioritized by stakeholders around the world as measured by more favourable perceptions of government prioritization, increased industry funding and more effective marketing campaigns.

The poor are most directly affected by corrupt practices in the education sector - in Bangladesh , access to essential services such as education , in common with health , justice and individual safety , has become a function of the capacity to make unauthorised payments .	6.10. The poor are most directly affected by corrupt practices in the education sector - in Bangladesh, access to essential services such as education, in common with health, justice and individual safety, has become a function of the capacity to make unauthorised payments. Poor education sector governance and its subsequent impact on education inequality is driven by two main factors in Bangladesh: capture and bias (Goetz and Jenkins, 2005, reported in Al-Samarrai, 2008).97 Goetz and Jenkins identify three main areas where capture has a greater impact on the poor and may lead to widening inequality: * Where corrupt practices lead to the diversion of resources, the poor are less likely to be in a position to substitute their own resources for misappropriated government resources. For example, non-poor households are more likely to be able to afford private tuition to substitute for unauthorised teacher absence compared to poor households.98 Poor households also have fewer exit options from the government supported education system and will therefore be more affected by declines in access and quality associated with corruption. * The poor are in a weaker position in society as a whole compared to wealthier households and this makes it less likely that they will resist and expose corruption in the education sector, especially if they have to act individually. This lack of power also means they are more likely to face informal payments to access education services. * Capture strengthens the position of local elites because they are often the direct beneficiaries. This tends to further reinforce the wide differences in education and livelihood opportunities of the poor compared to the non-poor.

Equivalence factors translate a specific land use type (i.e. world average cropland, pasture, forest, fishing ground) into a universal unit of biologically productive area, a global hectare. In 2007, for example, cropland had an equivalence factor of 2.51 (Table 2), indicating that world-average cropland productivity was more than double the average productivity for all land combined. This same year, grazing land had an equivalence factor of 0.46, showing that grazing land was, on average, half as productive as the world-average bioproductive hectare. The equivalence factor for built-up land is set equal to that for cropland. Equivalence factors are calculated for every year, and are identical for every country in a given year.

Partnership with the Ministry of Health , Ministry of Trade , and the Ugandan Board of Standards is required to tackle the health , trade , and related issues in a coherent manner .	Makerere University professor of Animal Science (Dr. Connie Kyalisiima) has proposed to carry out research in managing aflatoxin using Bentonite clay in animal feeds in Uganda, to be funded by NORAD (Norway) and in collaboration from Peanut CRSP. Experience working on gender issues in Peanut CRSP research in a host country like Uganda would provide strategies of mainstreaming gender in peanut research that Peanut CRSP could use in its work in developing countries. In the future, Peanut CRSP projects should include in their design strategies to ensure that women and children, who are usually disadvantaged groups in rural farming areas, would benefit directly from new technological interventions (i.e., resistant peanut varieties, aflatoxin-free peanut products, etc.) by Peanut CRSP. The ongoing work in aflatoxin in peanut in Uganda/region is linked with the HIV/AIDS and other illnesses. Possible solution to the aflatoxin problem (i.e., use of Bentonite clay), has implications to people's health. Work on health issues would require critical participation of the Ugandan Ministry of Health and trained village health workers, an area where Peanut CRSP is not a traditional player. Partnership with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Trade, and the Ugandan Board of Standards is required to tackle the health, trade, and related issues in a coherent manner.

An extensive field diary was kept documenting contextual factors for each of the 10 villages .	Semistructured interviews (lasting an hour) were completed with 53 rice farmers in the 10 sample villages. The number of rice farmers interviewed per village ranged from three to six. Issues emerging in early interviews were followed up in subsequent interviews to gauge the extent to which they were generic to farmers in the region or specific to a household. This approach to the semistructured interviews recognizes that a household's resilience and ability to access assets to cope with climate hazards are embedded within the structures and contexts of their day-to-day lives (Wisner et al. 2004). An extensive field diary was kept documenting contextual factors for each of the 10 villages. This served as a useful validation tool for analysis of the semistructured interviews with farmers.

But SOEs had gradually been given the flexibility to make their own business decisions, and many were gram costs. But a full accounting would need to incorporate the potentially positive effects on peace building. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the cost of a reintegration program for excombatants was about US$800 per beneficiary.50 Such a program would likely be judged as cost inefficient by traditional standards. Whether or not it is still worth implementing depends on the implicit value policy makers attach to its social cohesion benefits. These spillovers from jobs may not be measured precisely, but at least they should be stated, for policy decisions to be transparent.

These examples illustrate how a combination of institutional management of inputs and local geography impedes some farmers ' access to resources that support rice cropping and recovery of cultivation following climate hazards .	The distribution of resources from the Block level worked against small-scale farmers. The storm surge in the 1999 super cyclone increased the salinity of many coastal fields; in response the government distributed gypsum to farmers from the Block offices. However, traveling to the Block office created significant transaction costs both in terms of lost time, which could otherwise be spent earning an income, and through funding travel. For these reasons farmers were unwilling to visit the Block office or transport gypsum to their fields (interview with Block level agricultural officer). Another farmer noted that he buys seeds in the private market because the Block is too far away (SSI:17), though many farmers were accessing seeds locally through cooperatives.

This inverse relationship between farm size and productivity was first observed in South Asia.27 But it has also emerged in Sub-Saharan Africa as population pressure on the land has led to agricultural intensification. In Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, a 1 percent increase in farm size is associated with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent reduction in yield.28 The use of family labor per hectare is also inversely correlated with farm size.29 The relationship between crop yields and farm size emerges, because the larger, more mechanized farms have higher productivity. But in the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia and 39 percent in Chile. In services sectors, their role is often more important. Even in Eastern European countries, where private sector entry is only two decades old, microenterprises account for 10 to 20 percent of employment in manufacturing and for 30 to 50 percent of employment in services.

Tree waste fuels the development's cogeneration plant to provide district heating and electricity. Energy-efficient - The houses face south for * maximum solar gain, are triple-glazed, and have high-thermal insulation. Water-efficient - Most rain water falling on * the site is collected and reused. Appliances are water-efficient and use recycled water when possible. Low-impact materials - Building * materials were selected from renewable or recycled sources within 35 miles of the site, to minimize the energy required for transportation. Waste recycling - Refuse-collection facilities * are designed to support recycling. Transport - The development works in part-* nership with the United Kingdom's leading car-sharing operator, City Car Club. Residents are encouraged to use this environmentally friendly alternative to car ownership; an onsite selection of vehicles is available for use. Encourage eco-friendly transport - Electric * and liquefied-petroleum-gas cars have priority over cars that burn petrol and diesel, and electricity is provided in parking spaces for charging electric cars.

Most countries have developed specific social protection interventions targeted at food security, including food distribution and rice subsidies in Bangladesh and food distribution through public 'utility stores' in Pakistan. However, access to these provisions has been a challenge. COVID-19 has not led to food production problems yet, and the food supply chain is relatively robust in most countries, apart from in Uganda and elsewhere for perishable foods. Across the Maintains countries, local markets have been shut (some intermittently) and there are some reports of increasing food inflation, which will exacerbate the impacts on nutrition. Some 8.3 million children have not received food via school feeding programmes; only Bangladesh has replaced this with high-energy biscuit provision. These issues, combined with major reductions in household income and the reduction in immunisation and child health services, means that we would expect to see a significant increase in the prevalence of under-five acute malnutrition in the coming months.

The design of the Doing Business indicators has been informed by theoretical insights gleaned from extensive research.1 In addition, background papers developing the methodology for most of the Doing Business indicator sets have established the importance of the rules and regulations that Doing Business measures for economic outcomes such as trade volumes, foreign direct investment, market capitalization in stock exchanges, and private credit as a percentage of GDP.2 Some Doing Business indicators give a higher score for more regulation and better-functioning institutions (such as courts or credit bureaus). Higher scores are given for stricter disclosure requirements for related-party transactions, for example, in the area of protecting minority investors. Higher scores are also given for a simplified way of applying regulation that keeps compliance costs for firms low--such as by easing the burden of business start-up formalities with a one-stop shop or through a single online portal. Finally, the scores reward economies that apply a risk-based approach to regulation as a way to address social and environmental concerns--such 19About Doing Business as by placing a greater regulatory burden on activities that pose a high risk to the population and a lesser one on lower-risk activities. Thus, the economies that rank highest on the ease of doing business are not those where there is no regulation, but those where governments have managed to create rules that facilitate interactions in the marketplace without needlessly hindering the development of the private sector.

The biggest challenge is to reach the largest number of people, especially those at risk and who can't rapidly reach healthcare facilities. This challenge is being overcome by intensifying the publicity of the project through several channels (social media - Facebook, Instagram, website, open media - TV, supporter and partner sites - UFPE, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Hospital Clinics, etc.), and mainly based on our user's experience (word-of-mouth). The second is to incorporate these new digital practices into the routine of health professionals. Awareness and training are being used to overcome this challenge. This project is organizationally and financially sustainable, since telehealth has already proved to be viable and an important instrument to complement face-to-face healthcare. Partnerships and financial support in the public and private sectors are viable alternatives, due to the scalability of the solution, and recognition of the cost-benefit ratio of digital practices. In addition, our institution is a recognized and solid public university in Brazil, with 73 years of commitment to society, the environment and the country's economy. Our technological strategy can be easily adopted and translate to other languages.

The later the support, the more difficult and costly it is to put that child back on a normal developmental trajectory. In Romania, during the early transition years, the cognitive performance of orphans was lower the older they were when they left state orphanages. Social, emotional, and cognitive isolation was common in these facilities.31 While foundations are laid early on, human capital and skills continue to be formed throughout childhood, young adulthood, and working life. Schooling is fundamental for the further development of cognitive and social skills until the end of adolescence, but learning abilities continue to be shaped by physical and mental health. Social skills remain malleable through adolescence and early adult years.32 Young adults can continue into more specialized skill-building, including at tertiary levels, but their success depends on whether they have acquired the generic skills needed to learn and adapt to different tasks and problem-solving environments.

This improved communication system will alert the user to the presence of a hazard and the need to minimize exposure and risk , resulting in safer transportation , handling and use of chemicals .	"The ""WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard"" was approved by the 28th World Health Assembly in 1975 and the classification has gained wide acceptance. Guidelines were first issued in 1978, and have been revised and reissued at two to three year intervals. In December 2002, the United Nations Committee on Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (UNCETDG/GHS) approved a document called ""The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals"" with the intent to provide a globally-harmonized system to address classification of chemicals, labels, and safety data sheets. Classification and labeling based on acute toxicity form a part of the GHS, but there are some differences between the GHS and the WHO traditional classification of pesticides by hazard. The benefits of the GHS (according to http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/international/globalharmon.htm) are:  Enhance the protection of human health and the environment: Consistent and widespread use of GHS will enhance protection of human health and the environment by providing an internationally comprehensible system for hazard communication. GHS will help ensure more consistency in the classification and labeling of all chemicals, thereby improving and simplifying hazard communication. This improved communication system will alert the user to the presence of a hazard and the need to minimize exposure and risk, resulting in safer transportation, handling and use of chemicals.  Promote sound management of chemicals worldwide: GHS will provide a harmonized basis for the first step in the sound management of chemicals, identifying hazards, and communicating them. This will be particularly useful for countries without well-developed regulatory systems.  Facilitate Trade: GHS will reduce costly and time-consuming activities needed to comply with multiple classification and labeling systems, promoting more consistency in regulation and reducing non-tariff barriers to trade."

Its trade relations are characterized by raw material imports (e.g., metals and wood from Latin America, oil and cotton from Africa, or wool from Australia), of which only a quarter remain in the country. Changing Chinese consumption habits that have accompanied an improved standard of living (such as increasing meat and milk consumption) are demanding a growing number of imports, namely, agricultural and grazing land products. Although a major portion of resources leave China again in the form of finished products (e.g., paper, furniture or textiles) for the USA, Japan, Australia, South Korea and the EU, overall imports exceeded exports in 2005; the trade balance in this year was negative. Germany, on the other hand, had a positive trade balance and exported more than was imported in 2005; the German Footprint of consumption was 0.4 gha per capita smaller than the production Footprint.

It usually takes enterprises 3 to 5 years to reach their full potential, and finding a niche in the economy can be critical for success. Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries. Apprentices trained informally by the baker opened 20 enterprises of their own and created about 84 jobs. Other rural enterprises were not as successful. Some developed products that succeeded in rural markets but not in urban markets because of high transport costs, poor marketing, or poor quality. Most entrepreneurs reported challenges in maintaining quality and continuous production. Rural enterprises had trouble finding an urban location in which to present their products, a result that highlights the problem of multiple constraints.

Education influences access to employment opportunities. Education contributes both to the occupations where individuals work, as well as the productivity in these occupations. Patterns of occupational selection are rather strong in Coted'Ivoire. Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agriculture, and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary education or more. The share of nonagricultural self-employment is relatively stable across levels of education, although it slightly decreases at secondary levels and above (Figure1.10). Education is a key determinant of access to certain types of job. As such, stronger gender differences in educational attainment contribute to the strong gender differences in occupation. Box 1.4 further describes the likelihood of employment in the main types of employment given individual characteristics (gender, education) while controlling for other situational factors (social origin, region of residence). Results show that the descriptive patterns of occupational selection by educational level are strong. Chapter6 further discusses the links between education, skills and training, and productive employment in Coted'Ivoire.	Education influences access to employment opportunities.

Law enforcement policy therefore needs to be carefully designed , keeping in mind both the objective of drug control and the possible unintended results .	"29. In any drug control system, supply reduction and the enforcement of regulations will always be an important element of an integrated and balanced approach. Efforts to suppress the illicit production and supply of drugs, when properly designed and implemented, are essential tools for reducing the social and health damage resulting from illicit drug markets. 30. In recent years, some criticisms have singled out efforts to suppress the illicit supply and use of drugs, claiming that they are failed policies on the grounds that drug abuse remains prevalent. The logic behind that argument is questionable. Nobody has advocated abandoning the global response to AIDS or hunger because those problems have not been eliminated. Rather, those efforts are held to be the more reasonable standards for improving the situation, compared with the alternative of inaction. 31. All other things being equal, higher prices--which may result from a more restricted illicit supply due to law enforcement efforts--will lead to reduced demand. But higher drug prices can affect not only the problems associated with drug-taking but also the problems associated with drug trafficking and with law enforcement efforts. Where the extent of the trafficking falls less than proportionally to the increase in prices, more vigorous law enforcement activity may increase the total revenue available to traffickers and thus increase the incentive to engage in that illicit trade and to struggle for dominance within that trade. 32. Law enforcement policy therefore needs to be carefully designed, keeping in mind both the objective of drug control and the possible unintended results. It is not the case that the world must choose between ""militarized"" drug law enforcement and the legalization of non-medical use of internationally controlled drugs. The conventions do not mandate a ""war on drugs""."	Law enforcement policy therefore needs to be carefully designed, keeping in mind both the objective of drug control and the possible unintended results.

However , traveling to the Block office created significant transaction costs both in terms of lost time , which could otherwise be spent earning an income , and through funding travel .	The distribution of resources from the Block level worked against small-scale farmers. The storm surge in the 1999 super cyclone increased the salinity of many coastal fields; in response the government distributed gypsum to farmers from the Block offices. However, traveling to the Block office created significant transaction costs both in terms of lost time, which could otherwise be spent earning an income, and through funding travel. For these reasons farmers were unwilling to visit the Block office or transport gypsum to their fields (interview with Block level agricultural officer). Another farmer noted that he buys seeds in the private market because the Block is too far away (SSI:17), though many farmers were accessing seeds locally through cooperatives. These examples illustrate how a combination of institutional management of inputs and local geography impedes some farmers' access to resources that support rice cropping and recovery of cultivation following climate hazards.

In clusters, similar firms that locate next to each other tend to benefit from a broader pool of qualified workers and common support services. Firms also connect with foreign businesses through trade and investment, and, in integrating with global value chains, they can acquire more advanced knowledge, technology, and management know-how. In all these ways, specific jobs can contribute to productivity gains of others and elsewhere in the economy. But effects can be negative as well if jobs overuse natural resources or damage the environment, thus reducing aggregate productivity. by the start-ups and removing constraints to the growth of incumbents could be sizable, but the task is daunting (question 3).57 * * * Jobs can have an impact on the productivity of others, beyond the jobholder and the economic unit where they belong. Jobs that have these additional impacts do more (or less) for development.

Lack of disaggregated data and research also impede the development of effective policies and programmes to promote inclusive education .	Education is a fundamental human right and an essential condition for individual development and full and effective participation in society. However, too many persons with disabilities continue to be denied this fundamental right due to numerous barriers and obstacles to accessible education, including prejudice and discrimination against those with disabilities, the lack of qualified teachers to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities as well as inaccessible schools and educational materials. Lack of disaggregated data and research also impede the development of effective policies and programmes to promote inclusive education. Available evidence shows that persons with disabilities are less likely to attend school, less likely to complete primary or secondary education, and less likely to be literate.

Due to the strength of Bangladeshi manufacturing , most investment from the UK and the US is focused on this area .	"According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the largest investors in Bangladesh are Asian countries. The region generated 32% of total investment in 2008, led by Japan and Singapore. Asia is followed by the UK and the US with 21% and 20% shares respectively - a significant joint share for these two English-speaking countries. Due to the strength of Bangladeshi manufacturing, most investment from the UK and the US is focused on this area. This further encourages Bengalis to learn to speak English, as this is a typical requirement for someone working within the industry. On a company level, Microsoft invested more than US$45 million in 2008 in a software development site. This provides Microsoft with a pool of talent comprised of Bangladeshi students. These students in turn benefit from training, better facilities and work experience with Microsoft, with this facility accepting both existing students and graduates. Country offers potential despite difficulties Infrastructure deficiencies represent the primary deterrents to economic growth in Bangladesh. There have been many years of under-investment in the country. As a result, a large proportion of the population has to contend with very poor basic infrastructure. Furthermore, the lack of dependable power and water supply, as well as effective transport, represent a deterrent to many investors. Other impediments to foreign investment include political corruption. Despite this, Bangladesh offers huge opportunity: the country's stabilising political situation and numerous government incentives have helped build a positive climate for new investments.

It is thus a transactions lending technology in which financial institutions address the problem of information asymmetry by focusing on a subset of the firms ' assets , as the primary source of repayment ( Berger and Udell , 2006 ) .	71. Asset-based lending (ABL) is any form of lending secured by an asset. It is thus a transactions lending technology in which financial institutions address the problem of information asymmetry by focusing on a subset of the firms' assets, as the primary source of repayment (Berger and Udell, 2006). Typically, four types of asset classes are secured under ABL: accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate. 72. The amount the firm can borrow depends on the appraised value of the selected assets, rather than on the overall creditworthiness of the firm, taking into account the ease to sell offthe assets should the borrower be unable to generate cash to repay the loan. The amount of credit extended is linked to the liquidation value of the assets, which is estimated and monitored on the basis of hard data, often relying on industry-specific knowledge. Thus, monitoring and asset evaluation methodologies are of the utmost importance for this type of lending, which explains the historical use of 'tangible' assets to secure loans and, on the other hand, the limited exploitation of intangibles, such as trademarks, patents and copyright. However, as methodologies for evaluating intangible assets become more accepted, these assets can also increasingly be used as collateral (Box 2).	It is thus a transactions lending technology in which financial institutions address the problem of information asymmetry by focusing on a subset of the firms' assets, as the primary source of repayment (Berger and Udell, 2006).

In June, three members of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) were attacked by armed assailants while they were in a car, returning from a meeting. Local NGOs said that the justice system continued to be misused to harass and discourage human rights defenders. Unnecessary and excessive use of force by security forces during peaceful protests wasalso reported. The vast majority of attacks registered against human rights defenders remained unpunished, as a result of multiple obstacles hindering investigations and trials. There was little progress in the investigation into the killing in March 2016 of Berta Caceres, the Indigenous environmental defender and cofounder of COPINH. The public hearings of eight suspects detained in relation to the case were postponed on multiple occasions. Independent experts revealed a lack of due diligence in the investigations, including a lack of prosecution of other individuals potentially involved in the crime. There was no information about any progress made by the Public Prosecutor in identifying those responsible for planningher killing. Although some progress was made to protect human rights defenders through the National Mechanism to Protect Human Rights Defenders, Journalists, Social Commentators and Justice Officials, efforts to ensure their comprehensive protection remained insufficient. New provisions of the Criminal Code on terrorism and related criminal offences approved by Congress in February and September were defined in an overly broad and vague manner, contrary to the principle of legality.

In tertiary education , a clear trend is emerging that favours women - - with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men .	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.

In contrast , the Footprint takes a scientific approach by showing us where we stand .	The 21st Century already has some challenges in store for us, as well as for our children and grandchildren. We currently (2010) use over 50 percent more ecological services than the Earth can renew. A growing population - which, according to official estimates, could reach between 9 and 10 billion by the middle of the century - is increasing the demand for resources. Additionally, there is the fact that the inhabitants of emerging countries such as China, Brazil, Indonesia and India are increasingly emulating resource-consuming Western lifestyles, which are unsustainable. The situation is serious. It is certainly conceivable that climate problems will develop into a major threat to economic stability or that fisheries will be further depleted and eventually collapse altogether. These are but two examples. A moralistic dialogue between hope and terror makes little sense, however, in solving this challenge. In contrast, the Footprint takes a scientific approach by showing us where we stand. When businesses, cities or countries recognize how much biocapacity they need and how much they have at their disposal, they are able to make more informed decisions.	In contrast, the Footprint takes a scientific approach by showing us where we stand.	A big foot on small planet? accounting with the ecological footprint.

Some stakeholders have expressed concerns related to the proposed prohibition on the sale of ""very high alcohol content"" products and the ""strict"" labeling of liquor beverage products, as these terms are undefined in the policy document. No amendments to the Liquor Act had been introduced as of March 2019. In December 2017, the Department of Health issued amendments to its regulations relating to health measures on alcoholic beverages (Amendment Regulations Relating to Health Messages on Container Labels of Alcoholic Beverages (R1458)). The regulations, which will enter into force December 22, 2020, require that the health warnings printed on the labels of alcoholic beverages be increased in size to oneeighth of the total container size, as opposed to one-eighth of the label.

Weddings presented households with substantial costs , but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor .	Expenses related to cultural activities Households struggling to access food via rice farming strategies remained saddled with other income stresses. These could be large significant events such as weddings or repeat small-scale household expenditures, e.g., for medicine. Weddings presented households with substantial costs, but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor. As a result, scarce financial resources were not invested into enhancing returns from rice farming. For example, one farmer interviewed could not afford fertilizer for the 2014 main monsoon rice growing season (kharif season) because of paying for his daughter's wedding, with predictions of lower yields and shortage of food later in the year (SSI:13). The costs of weddings often exceeded rice farmers' financial capabilities, resulting in loan taking or sales of land. The knock-on effect is reduced investment in rice cropping, increased loan taking, or asset sales serving to reduce rice cropping households' long-term climate resilience.	Weddings presented households with substantial costs, but because of their cultural importance farmers often prioritized saving income for this endeavor.

Resource-rich countries face similar pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and the commodity booms of the last few years have only made these pressures stronger. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance are needed to jump-start development, cope with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact on export diversification.77 An enabling business environment. Finance, infrastructure, and business regulations set the quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase, is the top constraint in low-and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets have the potential to allocate resources toward more productive uses, thwart the channeling of resources to those with political connections or economic power, and expand financial in- those jobs. If this is the case, policies should remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily removed, offsetting them may be an option, but the costs and benefits of doing so need to be carefully assessed.

The TAM17, UFL13, FAM51 and NCS19 projects have trained a total of six Peanut CRSP External Evaluation Report 2005 - 15 - scientists. One student completed a Ph.D. degree and five completed M.S. degrees. Institutions and scientists in the U.S.A. and host countries have benefited from training in new procedures and techniques. Expertise in data collection, software development and modeling has been gained in UFL13 and NCS19. UGA28 has contributed to improved transformation techniques resulting in greater recovery of transgenic plants with better fertility. TAM17 has refined the introgression of useful traits from wild species, the identification of markers for useful traits, fatty acid and oil quality assay capabilities, and molecular biological techniques. FAM51 has characterized biochemical responses to drought and has identified drought-resistant genotypes. Screening techniques have been improved, and markers for identification of drought tolerant genotypes have been identified. Proteins are being evaluated for their anti-microbial activity against Aspergillus flavus. Items of equipment have been made available to some host countries and include vehicles, computers, digital cameras, and Global Positioning Systems (UFL13 and NCS19). In addition, labor saving devices for planting, harvesting, and shelling peanuts have been supplied to collaborators in Senegal, Ghana, Guyana, and Bolivia. 2.2.4 technology transfer. A significant improvement in technology transfer has been apparent during this second phase of the program. Notable achievements are the adoption of improved production practices extended through field days, workshops and farmer training activities in countries such as Ghana (UFL13 and NCS19), and Bolivia (UFL16) where yields have been increased two-fold. In Guyana (UFL52) the CRSP presence has resulted in a dramatic increase in area planted and production (five fold). The use of farmers as trainers is a very positive development, notably in Ghana (UFL13 and NCS19), Bolivia (UFL16) and in Guyana (UFL52) following farmer field school methodology.

Learning mediated through edtech remains out of reach if electricity does not reach households , if families do not have computers or smartphones , or if internet access is not available ( at appropriate bandwidth and speed ) or is prohibitively expensive .	However, distance learning poses a real challenge for equity. Learning mediated through edtech remains out of reach if electricity does not reach households, if families do not have computers or smartphones, or if internet access is not available (at appropriate bandwidth and speed) or is prohibitively expensive. Where limited access is available, boys are likely to be prioritised over girls. The digital gender divide means that there are multiple factors leading to gender-based digital exclusion. These include access-based challenges, affordability, lack of or lower levels of education, skills, and technological literacy, and inherent gender biases and socio-cultural norms (OECD, 2018). While smartphone use has grown rapidly, the GSMA found that in 2018 only 23% of sub-Saharan Africa's population used mobile internet regularly; as incomes are threatened, the cost of data may also become prohibitive (GSMA, 2019). Further, children without a safe and quiet space to study, or parents/carers who support educational learning, will be further disadvantaged.

For example, only rarely do sexual and reproductive health clinics and AIDS clinics have access to sign language interpreters for the deaf.153 Distance to health-care facilities is also a barrier for many persons with disabilities. Public transport is often inaccessible and unreliable, while private transportation can be prohibitively expensive. 151,152 The need for some persons with disabilities to have someone accompany them on the health visit not only increases transportation costs, but also raises issues of confidentiality for many.

This would necessitate new partnerships involving the private food industry (focusing on small-to medium-scale businesses), the public (government entities), and public (or NGOs) extension providers, health workers, traders, and other stakeholders, including donors. ITA should continue to provide research support and coordination to ensure sustainability and quality of the products produced in Senegal. The Peanut CRSP project at NCATSU includes emphasis on development of aflatoxin-free value-added peanut foods, feeds and nutraceuticals from peanut products and co-products suitable for the Senegal and U.S. markets. Work is examining the use of aluminosilicate clays (Attapulgite) to reduce levels of aflatoxins in cottage industry peanut paste. The results are very promising. It is recommended that this work be expanded to include that of Peanut CRSP project OKS55. The combined effort could focus on the aflatoxin problem throughout countries in West Africa. Proper funding would be required to assure success of the program. - 181 - The Peanut Collaborative Research Support Program External Evaluation Panel 2005 Report Annex 3 Annex 3.

Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development .	Education is a core human right1 and an essential tool for achieving sustainable development.2 It is an investment in human capital that confers benefits to both individuals and societies, allowing them to reach their fullest potential. Education is indispensable for closing the gap between women and men in respect to social and economic opportunities and is a key to empowering women and allowing them to become agents of change in economic, social and political spheres. It also improves women's chances of leading a healthy life and passing on the benefits to future generations.3 This chapter presents evidence-based analysis of progress in the education of girls and boys, and women and men, over the period 1990 -2012. Overall, the data show remarkable progress 1 United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948. 2 United Nations, 1994. 3 UNESCO, 2014. in participation in education and literacy levels. Substantial progress has been made in the achievement of universal primary education, and girls and boys around the world participate equally in primary education in most regions of the world. While the overall progress in secondary education is encouraging, it lags behind primary education. In addition, gender disparities are wider and occur in more countries at the secondary than at the primary level. Among positive global trends, the evidence shows that, girls--once they have access to school--tend to do better than boys in terms of progression at the primary and secondary levels and beyond. In tertiary education, a clear trend is emerging that favours women--with enrolments increasing faster for women than for men. However, gender disparities persist in the fields in which men and women choose to study. Women continue to be underrepresented among graduates in the fields of science and engineering in most countries.

Trade in services can be expected to expand rapidly in the coming years. Until recently, it was thought that only labor-intensive tasks would be relocated to developing countries, allowing production in industrial countries to focus on capital-or skill-intensive tasks.44 However, developing countries are now exporting not only traditional services, such as transportation and tourism, but also modern and skill-intensive services, such as financial intermediation, computer and information services, and legal and technical support.45 Skilled jobs performed by accountants, programmers, designers, architects, medical diagnosticians, and financial and statistical analysts are increasingly outsourced by firms in industrial countries.46 In India, the number of such skilled white-collar jobs has grown rapidly.47 However, some of the service jobs seen as skilled in developing countries are considered unskilled in industrial countries.48 India was a developing world pioneer in building a modern export-oriented services sector, but other countries--Brazil, Chile, China, and Malaysia, to name a few--have also seized the opportunity.49 But outsourcing does not only happen between industrial and developing countries. In the United States (the largest offshoring economy), 85 percent of the service trade is with other industrial countries.50 Twothirds of service sector exports from developing countries are actually South-South trade.51 Developing countries tend to specialize in certain activities within the services sector. For example, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Uruguay are strong in professional and ICT-related services; Chile in distribution and transportation services; Mexico in communication and distribution services; and Sub-Saharan African countries in professional services.52 This diversity in specialization will likely lead to both competition and cooperation, involving different segments of the services sector, rather than a headon collision between industrial and developing countries.

By their very nature, the complex dynamics of migration can never be fully measured, understood and regulated. However, as this report shows, we do have a continuously growing and improving body of data and evidence that can help us make better sense of the basic features of migration and how they are changing - as well as understanding how the context in which migration is occurring is evolving.

The first time an export plan is developed, it should be kept simple. It need be only a few pages long because important market data and planning elements may not yet be available. The initial planning effort itself gradually generates more information and insight. As you learn more about exporting and your company's competitive position, the export plan will become more detailed and complete.	What personnel and company resources will be dedicated to exporting?

Type D: Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities. This type includes two main subsets: (1) indigenous peoples' areas and territories established and run by indigenous peoples and (2) community conserved areas established and run by local communities. The subsets, which may not be neatly separated, apply to both sedentary and mobile peoples and communities. IUCN defines this governance type as: protected areas where the management authority and responsibility rest with indigenous peoples and/or local communities through various forms of customary or legal, formal or informal, institutions and rules. These can be relatively complex. For instance, land and/or sea resources may be collectively owned and managed while other resources may be managed individually or on a clan basis. Different indigenous peoples or communities may be in charge of the same area at different times, or of different resources within the same area. Rules generally intertwine with cultural and spiritual values. The customary rules and organizations managing natural resources often possess no statutory legal recognition or sanctioning power. In other cases, however, indigenous peoples and/or local communities are fully recognised as the legitimate authority in charge of state-listed protected areas or have legal title to the land, water or resources. Whatever the structure, the governance arrangements require IUCN recognises four broad types of governance of protected areas, any of which can be associated with any management objective: A. Governance by government B. Shared governance C. Private governance D. Governance by indigenous peoples and local communities 3. Governance that the area under the control of indigenous peoples and/or local communities has identifiable institutions and regulations that are responsible for achieving the protected area objectives.

Furthermore , part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture , following the lower ( relative ) demand for staples as incomes rise , will be offset by the increasing demand for higher-value and processed agricultural products as countries and their populations get richer .	There are also caveats to the somewhat more pessimistic perspective from the demand side. While Engel's Law holds globally, its strength at the national level depends on the tradability and comparative advantage of the countries' agricultural commodities. Furthermore, part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture, following the lower (relative) demand for staples as incomes rise, will be offset by the increasing demand for higher-value and processed agricultural products as countries and their populations get richer. This creates new jobs on the farm, but increasingly also offthe farm, in the expanding agricultural value chains and agribusinesses that is in extended agriculture. The latter effects are currently largely hidden in the numbers as they are largely incorporated in the manufacturing (food processing, machinery) and service (storage, transport, wholesale, retail) sectors of the national accounts. Yet, it is argued that it is exactly the extent to which countries manage to transform their agriculture away from staple crops, as they get richer and their staple crop productivity reaches sufficiently high levels, which determines whether they can generate productive employment for the poor and sustain the pace of rural poverty reduction.	Furthermore, part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture, following the lower (relative) demand for staples as incomes rise, will be offset by the increasing demand for higher-value and processed agricultural products as countries and their populations get richer.

Prepare in advance to make your trip smoother and more productive. * Schedule meetings before leaving the United States. Determine whether an interpreter will be required and, if so, make all necessary arrangements before arriving. Business language is generally more technical than the conversational speech that many travelers can handle--and mistakes can be costly. The U.S. Commercial Service can assist in locating qualified translators. * Prepare new business cards in as many languages and sizes as necessary. In most countries, exchanging business cards at the first meeting is considered good business manners. As a matter of courtesy, it is best to carry business cards printed both in English and, if applicable, in the language of the country being visited. * Prepare for different weather conditions. Seasonal weather conditions in the countries being visited are likely to be different from conditions in the United States. * Address health care issues. Plan appropriately with respect to prescription drugs, health insurance, vaccinations, and other matters, including dietary needs and preferences. * Find out about the electrical current in each of your destinations. A transformer, plug adapter, or both may be needed to demonstrate company products, as well as your own electronics--such as laptops or tablets for presentations. * Think about money. U.S. banks can provide a list of automatic teller machines overseas, exchange rates, and traveler's checks. * Consider transportation. Be aware of public and private transportation available in each country you'll be visiting and have a plan for getting around. Arrange as many needs as possible (e.g., hiring a driver) before you arrive. * Prepare for differences in culture.

While they contribute to 50 percent of the overall export value, export crops are only about a quarter of the value of total agricultural output. Food crops make up the rest (75 percent). Two in five farmers grow both cash and food crops (44 percent). About one-third grows only cash crops --they are richer on average. One in four (24 percent) grows only food crops --they are poorer on average. Traditionally, cash crops have received the most attention. These numbers would suggest greater attention to food crop growers and raising food crop productivity. This could also help raise labor productivity among women, who tend to be more engaged in the food cropping system 54 (Camara 1984; Chaleard 1988).

This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across sectors, firm types, and over time. It also explores how the wage growth path is related to labor productivity and other firm-level characteristics. The analysis helps answer the following questions: (a) Are wages higher in large or small firms, firms creating jobs versus non-job creators? (b) Do wages increase with productivity, including productivity within firms and across sector? (c) How does this wage-productivity relationship vary by the extent of market competition? First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in wages across and within sectors, even after accounting for skill composition. Not surprisingly, most sectors pay better than agriculture. Somewhat unexpectedly, the food manufacturing sector has one of the lowest average wage. The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23) are by far the highest-paying sectors. Those in the public sector (75) are also among the highest-paying jobs, lending support to the argument that in many developing countries including Coted'Ivoire, high public wages might impose a wage floor effect for skilled workers in the private sector. This observation is consistent with the finding in Chapter1 that for the more educated --those at least upper-secondary education --public jobs are more prevalent that private wage employment in the formal sector.

It highlights that the job-generating and poverty-reducing powers of agriculture are further conditioned by initial conditions ( agro-ecological potential and land distribution ) , production modalities ( large versus small scale ) and agricultural policies .	Third, income generation in agriculture is more poverty reducing. Cross-country evidence has convincingly shown that GDP growth in agriculture is more poverty reducing than GDP growth originating outside agriculture.32 This holds especially when it concerns extreme poverty, when most of the poor live in rural areas, earning their living in agriculture,33 and when land is more equally distributed, such that poor smallholders can put both their assets (labor and land) to work, benefit from them directly, and do so in large numbers. These cross-country empirical regularities are confirmed in Asia (for example, China)34 as well as in recent African case studies. For instance, two-thirds of the 4 percentage point reduction in the poverty headcount during 2005-2009 in Uganda could be accounted for by the increase in earnings among individuals who were working primarily in agriculture in 2005 and continued doing so through 2009.35 This followed because a large share of the population stayed in agriculture (49 percent) and many of them were poor, such that even a small drop in their poverty rate corresponded to a large number of people exiting poverty. The bulk of the sharp drop in poverty in Ethiopia during 1996-2011 could similarly be ascribed to growth in the agricultural sector.36 Yet, income generation in agriculture does not always or automatically lead to poverty reduction. In Brazil, for example, growth in agriculture did not contribute much to poverty reduction.37 Land in Brazil is unequally distributed, and its agricultural boom of the past two decades has largely been driven by large-scale, highly mechanized, skill-intensive agriculture (much of it following the development of the Cerrado for soybean exports to China). It highlights that the job-generating and poverty-reducing powers of agriculture are further conditioned by initial conditions (agro-ecological potential and land distribution), production modalities (large versus small scale) and agricultural policies.

Significant improvements in access to antenatal care have been achieved (table 2.5). In 2014, 83 per cent of pregnant women in the developing regions had at least one antenatal care visit, an improvement of 19 percentage points since 1990. Some developing regions have reached almost universal antenatal care coverage. Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Asia and SouthEastern Asia all have antenatal care coverage of over 90 per cent. African countries, especially, have advanced. Between 1990 and 2014, coverage increased from 50 to 89 per cent in Northern Africa and from 68 to 80 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. However, only little more than half of pregnant women in developing regions had the recommended minimum of four antenatal care visits.110 Furthermore, information on the quality of care is scarce.

Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3.

In DRC, children and adults risked their lives and health working in cobalt mines for a dollar a day. In South Africa, Lonmin Plc, a UK-based platinum mining giant, allowed its workforce to live in squalor in Marikana, in spite of making legally binding commitments to build 5,500 new houses over 10 years before. No one was held to account for the killing in 2012 of 34 people protesting against poor conditions at the mine. At the same time, there were growing signs of public pressure, action and demands for corporate accountability in various countries. In June, a landmark civil case was launched against Shell in the Netherlands - accusing it of complicity in the unlawful arrest, detention and execution of the Ogoni nine, hanged by Nigeria's military government in 1995. International organizations called for Shell to be investigated for its part in these serious human rights violations committed by the Nigerian security forces in Ogoniland in the 1990s. Some governments took positive steps. The DRC government committed to end child labour in the mining sector by 2025, in what could be a significant step towards eradicating the use of children as young asseven in dangerous mining work. Ghana ratified the UN Minamata Convention on Mercury, which aims to protect workers from toxic liquid metal by reducing mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining and to protect children from exposure.

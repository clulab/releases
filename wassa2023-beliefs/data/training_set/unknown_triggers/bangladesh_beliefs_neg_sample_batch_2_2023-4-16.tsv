Benefits to the Host Country include improved technologies , particularly new varieties and support production technologies .	Benefits to the Host Country include improved technologies, particularly new varieties and support production technologies. New cultivars, particularly with improved yield and quality, and multiple disease resistance, such as TSWV and leaf spot resistance, will be of considerable benefit. Improved production will result in increased farmer's income, especially the small-scale producers in poorer areas. Processors and consumers will benefit from better quality, nutritionally superior, and safe foods (aflatoxin-free), especially for children. Increased production will stimulate alternative uses in the domestic market or for export. Improved pest and disease resistance will reduce the use of pesticides and risk of environmental degradation and is good for the health of farmers.

This could contribute to strengthening dialogue about learning assessment system at the country level .	STRENGTHENING THE FOCUS ON LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS IN GPE'S OPERATIONAL WORK Until now, the quality assurance process for education sector program implementation grants (ESPIGs) has considered the funding model requirement met if the country had at least one comparable large-scale learning assessment over time. However, the comprehensive and systemic vision underpinning Indicator 15 can also be applied to assess if the requirement is met in a more system-oriented manner. For this purpose, the GPE Secretariat has developed a tool that is built largely from the Indicator 15 definition and methodology. It considers issues of system quality in relation to both large-scale assessments and public examinations (as for Indicator 15), but it goes further by examining classroom assessment as well. A pilot is planned to assess the use of this tool for both evaluation of the funding model requirement and Indicator 15 data collection in the future. This could contribute to strengthening dialogue about learning assessment system at the country level. 22. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Madagascar and Mali have participated in a diagnostic or thematic PASEC evaluation in the past, but 2019 will mark their first time participating in the full international PASEC.

Apprise Audit United Nations University International Organization, China https://cs.unu.edu & https://www.apprise.solutions As the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted supply chains around the world, stakeholders have been engaging the Apprise Audit team to discuss poten7al modifica7ons to the applica7on as they adapt and adjust its opera7onal usage in the evolving circumstances. For example, due to travel restric7ons between and within countries, some auditors have been unable to complete rou7ne factory inspec7ons where they u7lized Apprise Audit. The absence of these inspec7ons may leave workers more vulnerable to exploita7on as mechanisms to ensure accountability and compliance are interrupted. Although designed as a tool to be administered by a frontline responder and used by workers, stakeholders have expressed interest in modifying Apprise Audit to allow workers to instead self-administer the ques7onnaire. In other cases, local audit teams are able to visit factories, and there has been interest from stakeholders in adding new ques7ons to the Apprise Audit ques7onnaire to inquire about COVID-19 related ma]ers. These could include ques7ons regarding the availability of hand-washing facili7es, mask distribu7on and usage, adherence to social distancing guidelines and any other protocols mandated by governments or corpora7ons that are applicable in factories.

The disruption and delay that conflict and fragility can cause to a child 's education may be one reason why progress is so much slower on lower secondary out-of-school rates than it is on lower secondary completion rates .	The disruption and delay that conflict and fragility can cause to a child's education may be one reason why progress is so much slower on lower secondary out-of-school rates than it is on lower secondary completion rates. At the same time, primary completion rates are also increasing more slowly than lower secondary completion rates, making universal primary education a distant goal for many FCACs. This is not only an injustice for the children who are excluded from primary education, and a constraint on the growth of lower secondary completion rates in the future: It represents a risk of fueling instability in these countries, as education has been shown to reduce the risk of armed conflict and build resilience.29 FCACs especially facing challenges in getting more children into school and completing basic education include the Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Liberia, Mali and South Sudan--and the latter four have seen deteriorating rates in recent years.30 Cases of backward movement are causes for concern, and imply a need for greater support to help meet the challenges present. FCACs such as Afghanistan, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, and Somalia do not appear on most lists and charts in this chapter because of the lack of recent data availability, but their progress--as well as data issues--deserve attention as well.

Complex institutional mechanisms and processes are employed to share management authority and responsibility among a plurality of (formally and informally) entitled governmental and non-governmental actors. Shared governance, sometimes also referred to as co-management, comes in many forms. In ""collaborative"" management, decisionmaking authority and responsibility rest with one agency but the agency is required - by law or policy - to inform or consult other stakeholders. Participation in collaborative management can be strengthened by assigning to multi-stakeholder bodies the responsibility of developing technical proposals for protected area regulation and management, to be submitted ultimately to a decision-making authority for approval. In ""joint"" management, various actors sit on a management body with decision-making authority and responsibility. Decisions may or may not require consensus. In any of these cases, once decisions about management are taken, their implementation needs to be delegated to agreed bodies or individuals. One particular form of shared governance relates to transboundary protected areas, which involve at least two or more governments and possibly other local actors."

Education Cannot Wait is the first global fund dedicated to education in emergencies and protracted crises. Currently, 75 million children are being deprived of their childhood, education and the chance to prepare for a productive adulthood. Hit by conflict and disasters, they are denied the opportunity to make the most of their lives. Yet, until now, education in emergencies and protracted crises has fallen between the cracks - not taken seriously enough when funding humanitarian aid and thus leaving education dramatically underfunded at a mere 3.4 per cent of humanitarian appeals.

Food security means access by all people at all times to adequate food required to live an active, healthy life. Its essential elements are both availability of food and the ability of the people to acquire it. National self-sufficiency in food may not ensure food security because the poor may not have enough income to buy adequate food. India, for example, is self-sufficient in rice because it does not need to import it. Yet, onethird of the Indian population cannot afford to buy basic food. Maintaining a stable supply of basic staples (through production or imports) at affordable prices for the poor, while maintaining incentives for production growth for farmers, is a key element in sustaining food security.

Migration can also exacerbate environmental and economic problems in receiving areas. For example, urban areas attract migrants seeking better lives. High in-migration contributes to crowding and environmental/ sanitation issues in slums. Studies also point towards urbanization as a force driving regional warming (heat islands) which can exacerbate drying trends, among other problems.6 Some of these cities, such as Dhaka, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Shanghai and Tianjin, Alexandria and Cairo, Mumbai and Kolkata, Jakarta, Tokyo and Osaka-Kobe, Lagos, Bangkok, New York City, and Los Angeles, are located in areas exposed to sea level rise. Sea level rise could motivate resettlement, forced migration, or other forms of human mobility.7 Environmental change has a multiplier effect on other migration drivers.8 As an illustration, land degradation in Niger has undermined the resilience of farmers to recurring drought.9 More erratic weather, rising sea level and other climate change impacts will exacerbate both migration pressures and environmental degradation.10 What is certain from empirical and theoretical research on environmentally-induced migration, in all its varieties, is that environmental change is one of many contributing factors.

Rice development often acts as an entry point for the development of the agricultural sector as a whole by enhancing household food security , reducing production risk , enhancing income , and averting natural resource degradation .	"Warda is an autonomous Intergovernmental Research Association of 17 countries in West and Central Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. WARDA was founded in 1970. Since 1986, WARDA has also been a member of the CGIAR. WARDA's mission is ""to contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in poor rural and urban populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, through research, partnerships, capacity strengthening, and policy support on rice-based systems, and in ways that promote sustainable agricultural development based on environmentally sound management of natural resources."" Rice is a unique and highly political commodity in Africa. Because of its ease of preparation, low preparation costs, low price, and steady supplies (through imports), rice consumption is increasing rapidly, providing food security for Africa's poor. Because of its large genetic diversity, it tolerates extreme soil and weather conditions, allowing farmers to produce food in adverse environments. Rice is also an integrating crop. Rice development often acts as an entry point for the development of the agricultural sector as a whole by enhancing household food security, reducing production risk, enhancing income, and averting natural resource degradation. WARDA will therefore seek to contribute to poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa through integrated sustainable development of the rice sector, particularly through technology development. WARDA's ultimate beneficiaries are rice producers and consumers in West and Central Africa. WARDA's more immediate beneficiaries are its research and development collaborators, such as national agricultural research and extension systems and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)."

This will help build bridges between indigenous knowledge and scientific expertise , and stimulate the formation of networks between farmers and other inlandvalley development stakeholders .	Inland valleys have very complex, dynamic, and diverse human, social, natural, and physical dimensions and interconnections. This complexity needs to be understood to determine options for improved and integrated natural resource management. Given the diversity of inland-valley ecosystems, a bottom-up social learning process will be critical. Only then can sustainable and lasting impact on food security in the region be achieved. A participatory learning and action research approach among inlandvalley development stakeholders (farmers, change agents, extension, research) at the grassroots level is required. This will help build bridges between indigenous knowledge and scientific expertise, and stimulate the formation of networks between farmers and other inlandvalley development stakeholders. It will also be instrumental to the development of an INRM framework and curriculum for farmer learning for inland valleys in West Africa. WARDA is using integrated rice management as an entry point to INRM for inland valleys. A complete curriculum has been developed, containing a facilitators' manual and a technical manual dealing with all management interventions from land preparation to harvest and postharvest issues. The Inland Valley Consortium (10 West and Central African countries hosted by WARDA that focus on intensified but sustainable use of inland valleys) forms the foundation of the inland-valley research and development platform that is being built at regional and national levels.	This will help build bridges between indigenous knowledge and scientific expertise, and stimulate the formation of networks between farmers and other inlandvalley development stakeholders.

In others, governments can support the private sector in creating more of these jobs. Sometimes this can be achieved by removing constraints that impede the creation of jobs with high development payoffs. When this is not possible, policies can be more proactive and bypass the constraints, provided that the gains to society from doing so outweigh the cost. developing countries where formal sectors are small, funding these programs through general taxation is increasingly discussed,108 but any taxes create distortions. In the end, there is no substitute for affordable social protection benefits that are valued by workers. The main issue is coherently integrating social protection and social assistance to minimize gaps and overlaps.	Priorities: Realizing the development payoffs from jobs In addition to ensuring that the fundamentals support growth and that labor policies are adequate, decision makers can help realize the development payoffs that come from jobs.

"The Chinese authorities continued their unprecedented crackdown on dissent with a ruthless campaign of arbitrary arrests, detention, imprisonment and torture and other ill-treatment of human rights lawyers and activists. The authorities persisted in the use of ""residential surveillance in a designated location"", a form of secret incommunicado detention that allowed the police to hold individuals for up to six months outside the formal detention system, without access to legal counsel of their choice, their families or others, and placed suspects at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. This form of detention was used to curb the activities of human rights defenders, including lawyers, activists and religious practitioners. The government also continued to imprison those trying to commemorate peacefully the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 3-4 June 1989 in the capital, Beijing, in which hundreds, if not thousands, of protesters were killed or injured after the People's Liberation Army opened fire on unarmed civilians.

Moreover, clean and modern forms of energy can also bring benefits to many persons with disabilities worldwide, given that they may spend extended periods at home due to mobility challenges, may need more time for self-care at home, or because they are kept hidden due to stigma or shame, and may thus suffer higher exposure to indoor pollution caused by the use of solid fuels for cooking or lighting.

In 2015 , the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16 .	Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education. Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for household enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills enable individuals to better manage their finances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15-34-yearolds in Coted'Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20-64-year-olds, 38 percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Coted'Ivoire. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective implementation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school. Supporting complete enrollment will require significant investments to meet a substantial increase in coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.

Household air pollution may especially be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, where in 2013 more than half of the population still used solid fuels for cooking and heating. Even in the Americas and Europe, the regions where use of solid fuels is the lowest, the population using solid fuels is still significant at 25 per cent in the Americas and 23 per cent in Europe.350 Furthermore, available data from 14 developing countries, around 2010, show that in all countries a higher proportion of households with persons with disabilities than without persons with disabilities cooks with wood or coal (Figure II.73). On average, 53 per cent of households with persons with disabilities versus 46 per cent of households without persons with disabilities use these traditional forms of energy for cooking. The percentages of households with persons with disabilities that cook with wood and/or coal vary from 1.4 per cent in Iran to 97 per cent in Tanzania.

Education contributes both to the occupations where individuals work, as well as the productivity in these occupations. Patterns of occupational selection are rather strong in Coted'Ivoire. Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agriculture, and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary education or more. The share of nonagricultural self-employment is relatively stable across levels of education, although it slightly decreases at secondary levels and above (Figure1.10). Education is a key determinant of access to certain types of job. As such, stronger gender differences in educational attainment contribute to the strong gender differences in occupation. Box 1.4 further describes the likelihood of employment in the main types of employment given individual characteristics (gender, education) while controlling for other situational factors (social origin, region of residence). Results show that the descriptive patterns of occupational selection by educational level are strong.

The FFC system is a third food-related category under the Food with Health Claims system , parallel to two other premarket government approval systems , Foods for Specified Health Uses ( FOSHU ) and Foods with Nutrient Function Claims ( FNFC ) .	"In Japan, nutritional supplements are regulated as a part of a loosely defined ""health food"" subcategory of foodstuffs, unlike in the United States, where nutritional supplements are regulated independently. Japan has taken steps to streamline import procedures and to improve access in this market. However, many significant market access barriers remain, including a 12.5 percent tariff on vitamin imports. Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency (CAA) started implementing a new system for Food with Functional Claims (FFC) as of April 1, 2015. The FFC system is a third food-related category under the Food with Health Claims system, parallel to two other premarket government approval systems, Foods for Specified Health Uses (FOSHU) and Foods with Nutrient Function Claims (FNFC). These processes apply to both FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 293 imported and domestic products. Producers of most nutritional supplements are generally unable to obtain FOSHU approval or FNFC designation due to FOSHU's costly and time-consuming approval process and FNFC's standards and specifications, which limit the range of nutritional ingredients such as vitamins and minerals that can qualify for FNFC. Vitamin and mineral products designated under the FNFC system are excluded from the FFC system. In 2016, a CAA expert panel considered including such products in the FFC but ultimately elected against inclusion, in part due to strong opposition from consumer groups. U.S. industry remains concerned that the 2015 FFC regulations on health food and dietary supplements are not in line with global best practices."

Coordination failures arise when markets fail to correctly signal the future payoffs of investment projects, such as large-scale infrastructure projects, and the private sector tends to underinvest on its own.

OPHI Working Paper 58 www.ophi.org.uk 3 This technical paper was written by researchers from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) to document the piloting and development of the WEAI so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings. The index evolved in late 2010 and early 2011 out of discussions among US government agencies involved in the Feed the Future Initiative regarding the need for an indicator to monitor women's empowerment. The discussions initially revolved around using a gender perceptions index but eventually focused on an index similar to the multidimensional poverty indexes being developed by OPHI. Following the definition of 5DE in agriculture by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), work began at IFPRI in June-July 2011 to develop questionnaire modules that could be used to elicit responses on each of these domains. The full survey--with household and individual questionnaires, administered to a primary male and a primary female respondent in each household 4 --was piloted from September to November 2011 in Feed the Future zones of influence in Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda. Index development took place from November 2011 to January 2012. Qualitative interviews and case studies with individuals, as well as a technical consultation with outside experts in January 2012, provided further input into the choice of indicators that comprise the index. The WEAI itself was launched on February 28, 2012, at the 56th session of the Committee on the Status of Women at the United Nations, New York, and subsequently in three separate presentations in March in London, New Delhi, and Washington, DC.

Part 2 Ecological accounting is the sum of the Footprints for all resources harvested and all waste generated within the country 's geographical borders .	"Part 2 Ecological accounting is the sum of the Footprints for all resources harvested and all waste generated within the country's geographical borders. For example, it would include the Footprint needed to manufacture products that are exported and consumed by people outside the country. This includes all the area within a country necessary for supporting the actual harvest of primary products (cropland, grazing land, forest land, and fishing grounds), the country's infrastructure and hydropower (built-up land), and the area needed to absorb fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions generated within the country (Carbon Footprint). The consumption Footprint differs from the production Footprint through trade: a country's consumption Footprint also contains the biocapacity of imported products and services. When biocapacity is made available to other countries through exports, this is reflected in the consumption Footprint of the importing country. When the Footprint of a country exceeds the biocapacity of the area available within that country, it runs an ""ecological deficit"" and we call it an ""ecological debtor."" Conversely, an ecological surplus exists when the biocapacity of a region exceeds its population's Footprint. Those countries with more biocapacity at their disposal than their population uses, in net terms, have an ""ecological surplus"" and are called ""ecological creditors"". Ecological surplus or deficit is analogous to a trade surplus or deficit. In a global economy, it is important to understand whether a country has a trade surplus or deficit. In the same way, knowledge of its ecological balance sheet also reveals important information. To maintain high-quality results when conducting Footprint analysis, Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have developed international standards. The standards are designed to ensure that Footprint assessments are produced consistently and according to communityproposed best practices.

Understanding changes in scale , emerging trends and shifting demographics related to global social and economic transformations , such as migration , help us make sense of the changing world we live in and plan for the future .	In most discussions on migration, the starting point is usually numbers. Understanding changes in scale, emerging trends and shifting demographics related to global social and economic transformations, such as migration, help us make sense of the changing world we live in and plan for the future. The current global estimate is that there were around 272 million international migrants in the world in 2019, which equates to 3.5 per cent of the global population.1 A first important point to note is that this is a very small minority of the world's population, meaning that staying within one's country of birth overwhelmingly remains the norm. The great majority of people do not migrate across borders; much larger numbers migrate within countries (an estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009).2 That said, the increase in international migrants has been evident over time - both numerically and proportionally - and at a slightly faster rate than previously anticipated.3 The overwhelming majority of people migrate internationally for reasons related to work, family and study - involving migration processes that largely occur without fundamentally challenging either migrants or the countries they enter. In contrast, other people leave their homes and countries for a range of compelling and sometimes tragic reasons, such as conflict, persecution and disaster. While those who have been displaced, such as refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), comprise a relatively small percentage of all migrants, they are often the most in need of assistance and support.

Agriculture , mainly at a subsistence level , makes up almost the entire GDP , although only about 13 % of the land is arable .	Rice yield has stagnated since 1995. In some irrigated areas, a yield decrease has been reported. The following are the major constraints to sustainable rice production in Burkina Faso: * Drought in upland areas and drought and flash floods in rainfed lowland (or inland swamp) areas because of irregular weather * Heat-induced sterility during the off-season in irrigated areas * Cold-induced sterility in December * Dominant use of NPK fertilizer formulated for cotton and not adapted to the rice crop * Inadequate and irregular input supplies: seeds, fertilizer, and credit * Lack of small farm equipment, especially for postharvest operations * Lack of effective farmer organizations and cooperatives * Poor maintenance of irrigation facilities * Lack of a well-defined rice policy * Poor road networks and marketing systems * Labor shortage because of competition from other agricultural activities * Weak research and extension support BURKINA FASO, previously Upper Volta, is a landlocked country bordered by Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Togo. Its 11.6 million people (in 1999) live in an area totaling 274,000 km2, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the Sahel. The land consists of rolling plains dissected by valleys formed by upper reaches of the Volta River. Agriculture, mainly at a subsistence level, makes up almost the entire GDP, although only about 13% of the land is arable. Further, substantial desertification has occurred as a result of previous inappropriate farming techniques used for peanuts and cotton for export. Deforestation has also been rampant, resulting in a lack of fuel wood.	Agriculture, mainly at a subsistence level, makes up almost the entire GDP, although only about 13% of the land is arable.

Additionally, C&A Foundation's work with the Organic Cotton Accelerator (OCA) has been critical to move the entire industry, as has our continuous engagement with governments, which has yielded initial positive results in terms of policy level support Q What have been the lessons learnt in the journey above? Even though there is renewed interest in organic cotton, challenges remain. While Q&A with Anita Chester each of the regions that we work in are unique in their agro-climatic and socioeconomic contexts, they experience a common thread of challenges. Lack of access to good quality nongenetically modified (non-GM) cotton is easily the greatest obstacle that holds back organic cotton. This is not just a problem in India; it is a challenge even in countries where GMOs have not been approved. This is not surprising as research has mostly been biased in favour of GM cotton seeds, and there has been limited investment and research on indigenous cultivars.

Cultivating a larger area of land (p < 0.05) and engaging in nonagricultural formal employment (p < 0.1) increased the odds of rice harvests meeting household needs for a longer period of time (Table 3). Owning land (p < 0.05), operating a larger area of land (p < 0.05), and being able to sell fruit produce (p < 0.05) reduced the odds of households using a larger share of their rice harvest for own consumption (Table 3).	Cultivating a larger area of land (p < 0.05) and engaging in nonagricultural formal employment (p < 0.1) increased the odds of rice harvests meeting household needs for a longer period of time (Table 3).

This approach focuses on identifying activities that may hold latent comparative advantage and on removing the constraints that dissuade private firms from taking up these activities. In fact, there are many informal industrial clusters in urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. They produce garments, leather shoes, simple metal products, and furniture, among other things, though seldom for export.17 These clusters have spontaneously developed, suggesting a potential comparative advantage in these industries. Reducing logistics costs, removing red tape, and addressing coordination issues could create the necessary conditions to attract foreign investors to these clusters, especially at a time when wage increases in coastal China are encouraging the relocation of some industries where low labor costs are a key competitive factor (box 6.1).18 Jobs, which start to trigger agglomeration effects and make connections to the global economy, are good jobs for development in agrarian countries. To create more of these jobs and become centers of economic dynamism, cities need to be more functional. But even in the most optimistic scenario, it will take time to complete the urbanization process, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority for reducing the high poverty levels.

However, there are no significant difference over time in the gender break-down in the sector. 75 The data from employment survey makes it hard to categorize employment in terms of tradable and non-tradable sectors. However, it is clear that small-scale retails activities (such as selling personal or food products) dominate nonagricultural self-employment in Coted'Ivoire.

The partners in Thailand , under the leadership of Kasetsart University scientists , have developed an excellent cadre of trainers who have good technical knowledge and training skills .	The partners in Thailand, under the leadership of Kasetsart University scientists, have developed an excellent cadre of trainers who have good technical knowledge and training skills. They have developed team-work with local agricultural extension workers and farmers' and women's associations at the village-level to showcase the benefits derived from the adoption of Peanut CRSP technologies. The study tour portion of the training courses exposed the participants to actual field situations, including the constraints met by villages in developing their enterprise, and how these were solved. The active involvement of extension workers and beneficiaries brought about a new dimension to training and technology transfer activities. The outputs went beyond research reports and papers. The project facilitated the production of extension materials such as brochures, leaflets, and posters, and the development of a Peanut CRSP website at KAPI in Kasetsart University, for general public access to peanut technology and training information. There has been significant leveraging of funds from the Thai government, which has been fully committed to the successful implementation of the project since Phase 1. The Thai Princess's Royal Project has supported several poor, isolated villages that are now producing clean and healthy products that are generating cash for the family. Other donors who have provided funds for training like USAID and FAO. Opportunity for accessing training funds from Thai AID and the Ministry of Industry is being pursued by Kasetsart University to ensure sustainability of funding in the future. The Host Country Project Investigators indicated that the continued support of Peanut CRSP would allow them to continue to generate government funds for training.

Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.

During the course of this research each country was assessed on nine qualitative indicators focussed on the education system to understand how the English language benefits individuals. These included: the proportion of English speakers; how adequately educated the workforce is; government expenditure on education; the usage of Internet and mobile phones. For the purposes of this study several interviews were also conducted with government bodies, universities and other educational institutions.

How jobs contribute to living standards , productivity , and social cohesion varies with a country 's level of development , its demography , its endowments , and its institutions .	How jobs contribute to living standards, productivity, and social cohesion varies with a country's level of development, its demography, its endowments, and its institutions. Jobs agendas are thus inherently country specific. By combining the various features of an economy, however, it is possible to build a typology of jobs challenges. It includes agrarian economies, conflict-affected countries, urbanizing countries, resource-rich countries, small island nations, countries with high youth unemployment, formalizing economies, and aging societies. Because the nature of the challenges varies, what makes a job good for development in one context may not be so relevant in another. And in some circumstances, tradeoffs emerge. The jobs that do the most to defuse tension in the short term may not do much for productivity, or those with the highest productivity impact may not lead to a broad-based improvement in living standards. Identifying good jobs for development helps visualize these tradeoffs.

The ideal world is not a Footprint world - an interview with Mathis Wackernagel Part 2 Ecological accounting information .	What consequences can this have? Some people have been living on land * where livestock is grazed or fields are cultivated. What happens to them when the State leases or sells these areas to foreign investors? South Korea recently acquired 689,000 * ha of land in Sudan. The United Arab Emirates has reserved 400,000 ha in the same country. Libya is growing wheat in Mali. How can low-income countries, which can no longer feed themselves and lack the funds for investing in new agricultural technologies, overcome such problems? In Sudan, investors export 70 percent of * the harvest while, at the same time, the country is the largest recipient of international food donations. Or: Between 2007 and 2011 the World Food Program of the United Nations will spend the same amount for aid deliveries to Ethiopians threatened with hunger as foreign investors have paid for land acquired there. How does this fit with the previous examples? You can see that these situations are complex and the issues are intricately linked. Suppose you have the job, as a negotiator for the United Nations, to create a win-win situation out of this. How can both sides, the investing nations and the nations selling their land, profit from equitable trade agreements? Develop ideas, approaches, and rules which could lead to such a situation? You will enter into negotiations with both parties. Prepare yourself: Which of your suggestions are imperative in the face of an increasingly resource-constrained world? The ideal world is not a Footprint world - an interview with Mathis Wackernagel Part 2 Ecological accounting information. We need accounting systems, not merely for the monetary dimension, but for ecological services as well, so that we can better manage our natural capital.

This section sheds light on existing institutional roles and strategies for the sector , as well as entry points to set up a more supportive business environment for the household enterprise sector .	A discussion of the informal sector would not be complete without addressing the issue of interactions between household enterprise operators and the state. In the literature, government failures have been identified as a key factor contributing to the spread of informality, especially in developing economies. In this context, informality is viewed as a deliberate rational choice in response to the relative costs and benefits of formal versus informal status (see Diop and Niang 2012, for an exhaustive list of other references). In other terms, institutional settings do influence individuals' decisions to operate formal or informal enterprises. When discussing government failures in this context, the literature indicates three factors affecting firms' choice of becoming or remaining informal: access to public services, the regulatory and tax environment, and the enforcement of regulations (Diop and Niang 2012). This section sheds light on existing institutional roles and strategies for the sector, as well as entry points to set up a more supportive business environment for the household enterprise sector.

Beyond labor policies 293 on the composition of employment. Economic downturns lead to transitions to informal employment or to household-based activities, and not necessarily to joblessness. Hence, research focuses on how macroeconomic fluctuations affect the share of informal employment, rather than the unemployment rate.3 Country case studies of the impact of the global crisis have confirmed the resilience of employment in developing countries. But macroeconomic stability is not less relevant there: while aggregate fluctuations do not greatly affect the number of workers employed, they do affect the earnings of those at work as well as their access to basic social protection instruments.4 Macroeconomic instability is often the outcome of unsustainable budget deficits and lax monetary policy. In the 1980s, Brazil plunged into a debt and high-inflation crisis that slashed its economic growth and halved the share of exports in its GDP. Triggered by high international interest rates in the late 1970s, the crisis then was compounded by the difficulty of keeping spending by subnational governments in check. Tight budgets and rigid monetary policy rules may not be a magic wand, however. Budget deficits are more or less worrisome depending on how quickly an economy is growing, whereas down. Labor standards, rules for international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), and migration agreements are among the instruments available to manage these international spillovers. Inter national organizations have a role to play in coordinating the important global project of producing and using high-quality data on jobs, on which sound policy making must rest.

Measures to monitor trade in precursor chemicals and prevent their diversion into illicit channels are key components of all strategies to prevent or curb illicit manu facture of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances .	"257. Measures to monitor trade in precursor chemicals and prevent their diversion into illicit channels are key components of all strategies to prevent or curb illicit manu facture of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 258. The mechanism for the monitoring of licit trade and the prevention of diversion is laid down in article 12 of the 1988 Convention, which has been complemented over the years by a series of resolutions at various levels of the international drug control system. The fundamental assumption underlying the system of international precursor control is that chemicals that can be used as drug precursors are licit commodities and that any transaction involving them is therefore presumed to be legitimate unless there is suspicion or evidence that the chemical concerned is to be used for illicit purposes. As such, ""the procurement of chemicals necessary to manufacture drugs is one of the few points ... where drug trafficking intersects with legitimate commerce. Regulation of legitimate commerce to deny traffickers the chemicals they need is one of our most valuable tools in the battle against drug criminals.""14 259. INCB has reviewed the achievements, progress and challenges of international precursor control in its annual reports on precursors.15 Over the past 25 years, since the entry into force of the 1988 Convention on 11 November 1990, States have succeeded, through the Convention and the oversight work undertaken by INCB, in substantially reducing the diversion of substances listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 Convention from international trade into illicit drug manufacture. After a quarter of a century, the 1988 Convention enjoys near universal adherence by States worldwide. Through its provisions and requirements, the Convention has served to establish, in 14 Chemical Action Task Force, Status Report for the 1992 Economic Summit (Washington, D.C., June 1992), p. 11. 15 SEE E/INCB/2011/4, E/INCB/2012/4, E/INCB/2013/4 and E/ INCB/2014/4."

For the vast majority of people, their work is the main source of income, especially in the poorest countries. And jobs-related events are the most frequent reasons for families to escape or fall into poverty. Furthermore, as earnings increase, individual choices expand--household members can opt to stay out of the labor force or to work fewer hours and dedicate more time to education, retirement, or family. Opportunities for gainful work, including in farming and self-employment, offer households the means to increase consumption and reduce its variability. Higher crop yields, access to small off-farm enterprise activities, the migration of family members to cities, and transitions to wage employment are milestones on the path to prosperity.

Verena: Well, I think I can answer this on three levels. The first level is that, with the Footprint, I found a communication tool with which I can compare and contrast things. The first time I had the chance to evaluate something practically using the Footprint was at the COP 9 in Bonn. How many politicians flew there and what an effort was expended! I thought to myself that the total expenditure, this negative influence which arose from the conference should be calculated and weighed against the decisions that were reached there. Was the number of positive decisions at least worth so many flights by the politicians?

An effective isolation policy is in place for confirmed cases (either institutional or at home) and is achieving high coverage and compliance; high-dependency care capacity has been augmented After community transition has become established, recommended guidance is that those with confirmed infection isolate (either at home or in institutional facilities) (WHO, 2020j).

There has been limited reliance on self-isolation due to the difficulties of implementing this in congested urban settlements where it is unrealistic for a person to be kept separate from others. However, similar issues have arisen as for quarantining international arrivals, with gaps in the quality and capacity of isolation facilities limiting effectiveness. As COVID-19 spreads to rural areas, self-isolation may become more feasible because there is more space. Some countries have sought to boost capacity through mobilising the private sector, although in some cases the private sector has been unwilling to engage due to fear of infection.

A core set of basic skills, both cognitive and social, is necessary for productive employment, and they cannot just be acquired on the job. Without such generic skills, the prospects of improving employment opportunities and earnings are thin.

Annex1 : Socio-economics, Gender and Policy Projects - 61 - Knowledge of methods used in conducting economic analysis was gained through the use of the new software and interactive exchange visits to Alabama and Bulgaria. Plans for producing publications were developed. The PIs jointly arrived at the realization that analytical tools necessary for this project would need to be rebuilt based on assumptions appropriate for a noncentrally controlled economy. Also, assumptions relative to farm unit size and managerial capabilities of the new farm owners would need to be retooled. Hence, technology transfer and technology transformation would result from the CRSP endeavor. ENEA was enabled to inaugurate better collection and use of farm level data, including the use of coding and data entry. This process became repeatable on a yearly basis and the focus shifted to a more rigorous system of data analysis. This new capability at data management has been used to increase the production of technical papers to disseminate the results. The papers encompass a range of topics, including the impact of technical innovation through new varieties, the pricing and marketing of agricultural products (peanut), optimizing farm planning and poverty levels, technical efficiencies in peanut production/processing, and a range of descriptive analyses. On the U.S. side of the technical benefits/achievements ledger, there were several outcomes: The University of Connecticut (UCONN) PI and his assistants gained additional experience in collecting, managing and analyzing data in situations with developing country conditions imposed.

Strong productivity growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversified the cash crop mix, but there has been no real diversification yet into high-value agricultural products. The expansion of rice, cotton, and cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective (Figure7). Rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive crops in Coted'Ivoire. Cotton and cashew producers make most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive employment. An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Vegetable production is also highly labor intensive, but its potential has so far not been fully exploited. Overall, these trends are promising, but scope for improvement remains.

Fifth, the dietary transformation following income growth and urbanization also opens up new demand for agricultural products and employment on, and increasingly also, offthe farm in the value chains. As countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well as purchased and packaged products increases. After Engel's Law, this is the second large Law of Demand, named after Bennett. This also opens up new jobs opportunities, directly in the production of these products (dairy, meat, fruits, and vegetables), and indirectly in the associated chains (storage, transport, processing, packaging, wholesale, and retail). The production of high-value agricultural products tends to be more labor intensive (see also Figure3.6), while jobs in the agricultural value chain (especially in agro-processing) are often taken up by women (Table 2.2). Together they add better earning and more inclusive jobs, mitigating the decline of jobs in staple crop production as increasing labor productivity in staple production releases labor (given less than unit income elasticity of demand for staples) and the structural transformation proceeds.

GLOBAL TUBERCULOSIS REPORT 2019142 The tuberculosis (TB) epidemic is strongly influenced by social and economic development, and by health-related risk factors. For example, numbers of TB cases and deaths started to decline in western Europe, North America and some other parts of the world around the turn of the 20th century, in association with growth in incomes, improvements in housing and better nutrition (1, 2). The fastest declines in western Europe occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, in the context of universal health coverage (UHC), rapid social and economic development, and the availability of effective drug treatments.

"Energy use The energy used to make tobacco products is reported by some companies (see Table 1). Manufacturing intensity refers to how much of a given measure - such as energy, CO2 emissions, water use, or waste production - is needed or created per unit of product (127). For example, from 2009 to 2013 JTI required roughly 10% more energy per cigarette, 5% more CO2 emissions per cigarette, but 10% less water per cigarette than other companies according to a comparison of these companies' annual reports. 16/ To b a c c o a n d i t s e n v i r o n m e n t a l i m p a c t : a n o v e r v i e w For comparison, the combined energy use of Starbucks' more than 22 000 coffee houses is 1392 gigawatt hours per year (132) - roughly equivalent to Altria's annual energy use. Combined, the tobacco companies' energy consumption is equivalent to building around 2 million automobiles. Predictably, tobacco companies claim to be ""greening"" their energy use. For example, in its 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Report (129), Altria states that it ""converted coal-fired boilers to natural gas boilers at three manufacturing facilities, significantly decreasing Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions. This also eliminated a significant coal ash waste stream."" These kinds of measures are touted as reducing the ecological impacts of the manufacturing process, but Altria operates other manufacturing facilities in the United States, and it is not know whether others were converted. In addition, natural gas is not a clean replacement - it also has a large ecological footprint."" There are also issues around the data formatting. Reporting per million cigarettes only, instead of absolute numbers, obscures rising overall environmental costs, as the company produces more cigarettes each year. While during the 2000s and early 2010s the standard unit of measurement for intensity was ""x amount of [water, CO2, energy, etc.] per million cigarettes produced,"" a recent trend has been to obscure the amount of environmental impact per cigarette produced, by using a variant of proportional calculation: measuring intensity in environmental costs per million of US dollars or British pounds in net tobacco revenue (128)."

In addition , the K-State team was interested in identifying needs in geospatial and farming systems research , capacity building , gender , nutrition , appropriate scale mechanization and effective communication strategies for the local partners .	To develop a successful proposal grounded in country-led and national priorities, Kansas State University (K-State) held three special events inviting potential partners to participate in an interactive meeting to assess Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) on various components of sustainable intensification (SI). The meetings were designed to seek input on identification of a geographical focus, existing knowledge, priorities, gaps, and the potential for partnerships. In addition, the K-State team was interested in identifying needs in geospatial and farming systems research, capacity building, gender, nutrition, appropriate scale mechanization and effective communication strategies for the local partners. These participatory events produced volumes of useful information that serves as the foundation, focus, and rationale for the proposed SIIL. As indicated in the proposal, the selection of the of the geographical focus, countries, partners, and areas of inquiries were based on the country-defined priorities and with active engagement of the various stakeholders, value chain partners, government organizations, national agricultural research systems (NARS), international centers including Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centers, nongovernmental agencies (NGOs) and private industry. This report provides an overview of the facilitated sessions, the methodology, the SWOT analyses from each event, as well as participant documentation from the sessions. The report is organized by providing a summary table of the results from the combined SWOT analyses sessions that provide the evidence for the areas of inquiry that SIIL will concentrate, along with the individual results from each country. The results sections include the agenda from each event, the participant list, and the results from the meetings. Interestingly, despite the geographic difference of the regions the SI needs were very similar.

Permanent cultivation of upland rice is practiced in many Asian and Latin American countries .	Permanent cultivation of upland rice is practiced in many Asian and Latin American countries. This is characterized by orderly intercropping, relay cropping, and sequential cropping with several crops. The largest area of permanent upland rice cultivation is in eastern India. In the Chhattisgarh Plateau area of Jharkand and Bihar, rainfall will support only a single upland crop per season. Rice may be grown continuously or rotated with legumes and pasture. Rice yields in continuous production tend to be very low (around 1 t/ha) because of nematode buildup and other biotic factors that are not well understood, but yields in rotation with legumes may exceed 2 t/ha. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, upland rice is usually double-cropped with gram, mustard, or other upland crops. Because the risk of crop damage or loss resulting from drought or pests is high, and because upland rice farmers are usually poor and have limited access to credit, most apply few inputs of animal manure, organic matter, chemical fertilizer, and pesticide to upland rice crops. This is particularly true in areas where farmers 22 Rice almanac produce rice on both lowland and upland fields.

Development often entails the movement of labor from rural , agricultural , and mostly subsistence activities to urban , nonagricultural , and mostly market-oriented activities .	Jobs are transformational PART1 Introduction to Part 1 Economic development is about improvements in living standards supported by productivity growth. It also involves social change associated with urbanization, integration in the world economy, and the drive toward gender equality. All of these transformations are related to jobs. The development process is about some jobs becoming better and others disappearing, about people taking jobs and changing jobs, and about jobs migrating to other places within and across countries. Development often entails the movement of labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly subsistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and mostly market-oriented activities. This movement transforms the lives of families and communities, the organization of firms, and the norms and values of societies. It can boost productivity and improve living standards and also affect the cohesiveness of society. Jobs are thus a key driver of development. * Living standards: Jobs provide earnings opportunities to lift people out of poverty, raise their consumption, and contribute to individual well-being more broadly. * Productivity: Through job creation and destruction within sectors and reallocations across sectors and countries, jobs are also at the root of economic growth. * Social cohesion: Jobs define who people are in many ways; by shaping values and be-DEVELOPMENT JOBS LIVING STANDARDS PRODUCTIVITY SOCIAL COHESION haviors, they can influence trust and civic engagement.

China is by far the largest T&T economy in Asia-Pacific and the 13th most competitive globally (up two spots from 2017). It welcomes more international visitors than any other country in the region and its T&T industry benefits from a large and growing domestic market. The cornerstone of China's competitiveness is its exceptional natural resources (4th) as well as the TTCI's highest score for cultural resources. The nation has the greatest number of UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites in the world as well as impressive wildlife (6th). It also ranks first on intangible heritage and cultural and entertainment digital demand, second for sports stadiums and eight for business events. Fairly low hotel prices (25th) and reduced ticket taxes (58th to 35th) help minimize the cost of staying and traveling within and to China. Moreover, travel is facilitated by an extensive list of air carriers (7th) that have produced the second-largest airline capacity in the world. Intra-country travel is also made easier by one of the world longest railway networks, which gets relatively positive marks for quality (17th) and efficiency (25th). However, given China's future tourism potential and needs, more investment needs to be diverted to enhancing the quality of roads (42nd), airports (53rd) and ports (55th).

"When the Footprint of a country exceeds the biocapacity of the area available within that country , it runs an "" ecological deficit "" and we call it an "" ecological debtor ."	"Part 2 Ecological accounting is the sum of the Footprints for all resources harvested and all waste generated within the country's geographical borders. For example, it would include the Footprint needed to manufacture products that are exported and consumed by people outside the country. This includes all the area within a country necessary for supporting the actual harvest of primary products (cropland, grazing land, forest land, and fishing grounds), the country's infrastructure and hydropower (built-up land), and the area needed to absorb fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions generated within the country (Carbon Footprint). The consumption Footprint differs from the production Footprint through trade: a country's consumption Footprint also contains the biocapacity of imported products and services. When biocapacity is made available to other countries through exports, this is reflected in the consumption Footprint of the importing country. When the Footprint of a country exceeds the biocapacity of the area available within that country, it runs an ""ecological deficit"" and we call it an ""ecological debtor."" Conversely, an ecological surplus exists when the biocapacity of a region exceeds its population's Footprint. Those countries with more biocapacity at their disposal than their population uses, in net terms, have an ""ecological surplus"" and are called ""ecological creditors"". Ecological surplus or deficit is analogous to a trade surplus or deficit. In a global economy, it is important to understand whether a country has a trade surplus or deficit. In the same way, knowledge of its ecological balance sheet also reveals important information. To maintain high-quality results when conducting Footprint analysis, Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations have developed international standards. The standards are designed to ensure that Footprint assessments are produced consistently and according to communityproposed best practices. They aim to ensure that assessments are conducted and communicated in a way that is accurate and transparent. land types used in ecological ."

Subtracting the difference in agricultural participation across age cohorts among the three least-developed countries, which are still at the cusp of their structural transformation (Ethiopia, Malawi, and Niger), as an indicator of a 'normal' age gradient, would reduce Coted'Ivoire's age gradient to about 10 percentage points (from 14.6 in 2008).	The rate of decline in agricultural engagement currently observed across Coted'Ivoire's age cohorts is overall consistent with this pattern.43 Nonetheless, a note of caution is in order.

"The experience of exile and life after it is also examined in the dossier ""Living, thinking, writing in exile"" (33/1, 2017) coordinated by the historian Ralph Schor, who strives to understand the paths and identity choices of a particular category of exiles: writers and thinkers. Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily in the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. Articles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to understand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive data from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their literary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of oneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer's perspective. Some varia articles 340 Appendices focus on the links between film and migration experiences in countries with a film industry. In what way do cinema and photography open up new discursive spaces?

The government has provided some support , with export processing zones , bonded warehouses , and special treatment of garments at ports .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

In the Mahanadi, we found that the lack of offfarm employment opportunities is a constraint for rice farmers. Without viable, alternative livelihood strategies farmers rely on rice cropping and a mix of different coping strategies despite the persistent vulnerability of rice cropping to climate hazards. Rice cropping in the Mahanadi Delta occurs in an economic environment with few options available to generate income for investment into farming. With limited use of remittances reinvested into rice farming and a lack of suitable local government support to enhance farming activities, resilience is further undermined. This exemplifies how a set of underlying contextual factors work together to keep rice cultivation in a lowlevel state that is sensitive to climate impacts, does not generate the resources farmers need to respond to future climate impacts, and requires farmers to engage in coping activities to sustain livelihoods.

Language is one of the most useful tools we have as humans. Without it we could not think of thoughts expressible to others, nor could we engage in the activities that commonly take place in the society we build ourselves (Di Pietro, 1994). Language is very important in education. The high status of English within a global economy of languages has meant that English language education is increasingly being promoted in international development initiatives. A broad goal of English language programs is that of developing the communicative ability to convey and interpret a message via written or spoken modalities to another person. In our country, there is no doubt that we still have not established a standard of education in schools and colleges. There are too many problems in our country that have to be eradicated to embrace a comprehensive education system through which we can expect ourselves to be a richer nation. We must not forget that students today will become the key members of our country who would be responsible for the overall development of our country. If we do not have good teacher, there is no way we could expect to have a balanced society in future.

The Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) emerged out of a meeting of concerned organizations and individuals in 1996. It was designed to foster collaboration and action to address the ecological, economic, and social harm caused by invasive alien species. The first phase of GISP (1997-2000) focused on building a knowledge base on the issue of invasive alien species. This phase was driven by an international consortium of experts working as volunteers. Among the significant outputs were a global strategy on invasive alien species (McNeely ET Al., 2001) and invasive Alien Species: A toolkit of best prevention and management practices (Wittenberg & cock, 2001). The second phase of GISP (2000 - present) is designed to build upon the products of Phase I and foster greater international awareness of the problems caused by IAS. In Phase II, GISP will work with nations and regions on appropriate, cooperative measures for preventing, controlling, or eradicating IAS through six working groups, organized around the following topics: 1. National and regional facilitation and cooperation 2. Communication, education and outreach 3. Global information management 4. Pathway Management 5. Evaluation and assessment 6. Law and policy Phase II operates through an Executive Board, Advisory Panel of IAS experts, a formal Secretariat with paid staff (based in South Africa), and partnerships among countries and international organizations.

The vast majority of attacks registered against human rights defenders remained unpunished, as a result of multiple obstacles hindering investigations and trials. There was little progress in the investigation into the killing in March 2016 of Berta Caceres, the Indigenous environmental defender and cofounder of COPINH. The public hearings of eight suspects detained in relation to the case were postponed on multiple occasions. Independent experts revealed a lack of due diligence in the investigations, including a lack of prosecution of other individuals potentially involved in the crime. There was no information about any progress made by the Public Prosecutor in identifying those responsible for planningher killing.

Trade agreements are a potential instrument for international coordination on rights. They can incorporate incentives for attention to voice and working conditions by linking trade access to the adoption and enforcement of labor laws and standards. Whether linking rights to trade actually leads to better outcomes for workers on either side of a trade agreement is less clear. Labor clauses can be used as a protectionist tool, undermining trade and employment opportunities in developing countries. Moreover, in the absence of capacity and institutions to monitor and enforce compliance, trade agreements on their own can be weak instruments.

It reflects the costs associated with narrow-body and wide-body passenger plane arrival and departure at the major international airports in each country. Charges include landing, terminal navigation and passenger and security charges as listed in the IATA Airport and Air Navigation Charges manual. Ticket taxes applicable to international travel were applied as described in the IATA List of Ticket and Airport Taxes and Fees manual. Per-passenger charges were calculated by applying a 75% load factor to a typical seating configuration of each type of aircraft. Value-added taxes (VATs) were calculated based on an average ticket price for each country, applied to half of the departing passengers, because the VAT is normally charged only on itineraries originating in the country concerned. A higher score indicates a lower level of charges and taxes.

In 49per cent of the 160countries assessed there exist provisions prohibiting employers from employing pregnant or nursing women in dangerous work, and another 21per cent of countries stipulate that these workers are not obliged to perform dangerous work. If a significant risk exists at the workplace, legislation often requires that employers take protective measures to address those risks by transferring a woman to other safe tasks or allowing her to take leave early.

Similar analysis for 18 countries in Latin America using the 1990 Latinobarometro survey confirms these findings. On the whole, the education of the worker and the circumstances he or she was born into play important roles in explaining inequalities in access to jobs, and the role of education is especially important for regular employment in the formal sector.50 * * * The interaction of jobs and social cohesion is not linear or simple to disentangle. This is an emerging area for further research across disciplines. The effect of jobs on trust and civic engagement at the individual level suggests that exchanges The exclusionary nature of networks is highlighted by the experience of migrants moving from rural areas to cities. Migrants often choose destinations where they have connections. But if they do not, they can be uprooted from family and community ties that provide economic and social support, including access to jobs. They may also lack the information needed to integrate into their new destinations. Migrants moving across borders or regions, internally displaced persons or refugees fleeing from conflict or returning after a peace agreement, and soldiers demobilized after conflict may be particularly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportunities. This is a concern in conflict situations as well as in contexts of structural transformation, when massive numbers of people move from rural to urban areas.45 Networks also do not reach many among the self-employed, especially home-based workers who work in isolation and domestic workers who lack opportunities to interact with others.

ENSURING THAT INTERNAL INSTALLATIONS ARE SAFE THROUGH MANDATED INSPECTIONS OR LIABILITY REGIMES Regulatory compliance is as essential as the rules themselves. In 2009, a fire caused by ineffective grounding and aging cables destroyed the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Accra, Ghana. As is often the case in economies where there is a shortage of qualified engineers and a large informal sector, although regulation existed--Ghana's National Wiring Code--it had not been observed. In Kenya, the informal sector, also known as jua kali, is extensively involved in the manufacturing sector. A study of electrical safety management in Kenya's informal sector shows that most jua kali operators do not follow electrical safety regulations and lack the appropriate equipment for electrical services.22 Despite the information prescribed in electrical codes and other regulation, technical audits often reveal faults in design, installation and maintenance. Inspections provide an incentive to comply with regulation. Initial inspections --carried out before the facility becomes operational--can help identify and fix any nonconformity of the installation.23 In economies where private sector electricians make the external connection to the network, nearly all require that the utility inspect the connection works ahead of the electricity turn-on. Similarly, in about 70% of economies covered by Doing Business inspections of a new building's electrical wiring are compulsory.

"The issue of violence is a recurring theme in the latest dossiers. The importance of this issue reflects the tragic consequences of migration policies in particular contexts or crises, and the emergence of work around migrants' journeys. The dossier ""Speaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europe"" (33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cecile Canut and Anaik Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language approach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration to Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered in multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, etc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their production from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) or their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they return to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of the discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. This perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting sociospatial inequalities in the era of globalization."

Training duration should be feasible, acceptable and affordable in the context of a specific jurisdiction, while long enough to ensure that the desired level of competencies and expertise is achieved. As these vary substantially based on the role that CHWs play, it is expected that CHWs with a polyvalent role and working on a full-time or regular basis (that is, those delivering more complex interventions or a wide range of primary health care services) would require longer training than those providing a single focused service on a more occasional basis. Table 3 provides selected examples of pre-service education that is considered by national policy-makers to be of appropriate duration (typically several months) in relation to the learning objectives of CHWs with a polyvalent role. CHWs with a more limited set of responsibilities have a shorter pre-service education (for example, 23 days for accredited social health activists in India) (67).

Policies also try to promote job creation in more environmentally friendly industries. Jobs in enterprises that produce wind mills for electricity generation, construct water and soil conservation systems, and plant and manage trees fall in this category. These are often called green jobs, with different definitions attached to the term. Industries matching the most common definitions of green jobs tend to be relatively small in many developing countries, with Brazil and China notable exceptions (box 5.6).58 Pending a precise quantification of environmental spillovers from jobs, it is likely that the activities with the greatest potential to mitigate adverse environmental damage in develop- for cost efficiency, bringing smaller local companies into the value chain. Contracting out provides opportunities for small and microenterprises to also reap the benefits of knowledge spillovers.52 Research can also shed light on the obstacles preventing the productivity spillovers from globally integrated jobs from materializing. Crosscountry analysis shows that the degree of labor market flexibility, barriers to firm entry, and infrastructure development substantially influence the impact of openness on growth.53 Knowledge spillovers hinge on the ability of the local economy to absorb them--human capital and research and development capacity are important. Local firms need a certain level of production and technological capabilities to be selected as suppliers by foreign companies. When technology gaps between local firms and foreign companies are large, productivity spillovers are less likely to occur.54 Environmental impacts. Jobs that overuse natural resources or damage the environment are less productive than their direct output might suggest. The environmental damage they create imposes a negative spillover on others, resulting in a lower net contribution to aggregate output. Natural resources such as the atmosphere, water, forests, and soil provide services useful for economic activities and necessary for human life, but they are often overused because their cost from a private point of view falls short of their true social cost.55 The emission of greenhouse gases is an example of a negative spillover.

When a growth strategy may not be sufficient Focusing on the aggregate relationship between growth and employment downplays some of the most important channels through which jobs connect to development. The very notion of employment as derived labor demand does not reflect the situation of the many working people in developing countries who are farmers and self-employed. The focus on the labor market as the transmission chain between growth and employment also does not capture the interaction of working people with others in households, at the workplace, and in society more broadly. Focusing solely on the relationship between growth and employment may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender equality, support urbanization, or contribute Growth strategies or jobs strategies? 88 WO R L D D EV E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3 In practice, however, tradeoffs between the three transformations can amount to more than just lags and gaps. Depending on the nature of the jobs challenges facing a country, tensions may emerge between growth that generates jobs for living standards and growth that generates jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion. Examples abound: * In agrarian economies, increasing productivity in smallholder farming is fundamental for poverty reduction, given the share of the population living in rural areas. But urban jobs in activities that connect the economy to world markets and global value chains are necessary for growth. With limited resources to support both, a tradeoff between living standards and productivity may arise. * In resource-rich countries, massive investments in extractive industries support accel- to peaceful collective decision making. Understanding how to enhance these positive spillovers from jobs might be difficult when only aggregates are considered.

But jobs may neither pull nor build skills to a significant degree, even if the foundational cognitive skills are in place. This occurs in situations where the benefits from agglomeration and global integration are present but not adequately exploited. Countries undergoing rapid urbanization often have sizable knowledge spillovers to reap but may fail to move up the value-added ladder. If so, they can be caught in traps of low productivity and low skills.110 Such traps arise when skills are insufficient to spur innovation and the demand for skills is too low to encourage their acquisition. In those cases, more relevant schooling and skill building at the secondary, technical, and likely higher levels are needed as a prerequisite for the creation of good jobs for development. tation and can have cascading ripple effects.104 In Singapore, India's Tata group was the first international company to partner with the Economic Development Board in 1972 to establish a company-owned training center for precision engineers.

Geodiversity provides the foundations for life on Earth and for the diversity of natural habitats and landscapes. Many individual geological features and landforms have cultural or iconic values for humans, which influence the way that we view surrounding natural or semi-natural habitats. Geodiversity has also had a profound influence on many aspects of cultural landscapes, built environments and economic activities. Protection of geodiversity can be in response to a range of interests, including those associated with important fossil sites; reference sites for geoscience; spectacular features linked with tourism; and landforms that have particular cultural or spiritual values. Geodiversity can contribute to sustainable economic development through tourism associated with geological features. Understanding the functional links between geodiversity and biodiversity is particularly important for conservation management in dynamic environments, where natural processes (e.g., floods, erosion and deposition) maintain habitat diversity and ecological functions.

For example , light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women , with significant impacts on reducing poverty .	Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on reducing poverty. If a boom is under way, the development payoff of new manufacturing jobs Ensuring that rights and standards are upheld requires a focus not only on implementing acquired rights but also on expanding their reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of formal laws and regulations. Associations of informal workers can play a key role in informing them, helping them access legal mechanisms, and offering them collective voice. But often, information alone is not enough: garment workers in the Lao People's Democratic Republic reported that they were told about their basic conditions of employment, but they did not always understand the details, nor how to enforce their rights.46 Not only can organizations of informal workers support workers in learning about and accessing rights and standards, but they can also bring cases to court on behalf of individuals and groups.47 The quality of institutions for accountability affects the extent to which labor rights are enforced in practice.48 Because court proceedings are often lengthy and costly, alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes, including conciliation, mediation, and arbitration prior to court hearings can expand access to justice and grievance redress.49 These alternative mechanisms are especially valuable to workers who cannot access the court system due to high costs or other barriers.	For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on reducing poverty.	World Development Report 2013: Jobs	World Bank	2012

Other factors of production are critical for explaining poverty reduction through jobs , particularly in rural areas .	Other factors of production are critical for explaining poverty reduction through jobs, particularly in rural areas. Studies from Uganda and Pakistan, using rural data spanning 4 and 10 years respectively, show that higher agricultural productivity, the growing commercialization of agriculture, and an increase in cash crop production contributed substantially to poverty reduction. The increase in the price of cash crops over this period also helped.12 Improvements in land rights and better access to input and output markets, due to infrastructure investments, also raised the odds of escaping poverty, particularly in Uganda. All of these factors affect the labor productivity of farmers but originate in land markets or food markets rather than labor markets.

Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State , as well as the regional and global community .	"ChaPTER i. ThE hEalTh aNd wElfaRE of maNkINd 5 27. One of the most serious challenges includes the loss of state control to organized criminal groups. Impunity and ungovernability pose a challenge to the collective security and well-being of any State, as well as the regional and global community. When state structures become involved with and affected by violence and systemic corruption, drug trafficking can further weaken the efficacy of Governments to the point of creating ""failed State"" conditions at the national or subregional level. Given the enormous amounts of money available to drug traffickers, law enforcement agencies are especially vulnerable to the threat of corruption, and that threat is greatly exacerbated when law enforcement agents are inadequately paid. 28. One of the most recent challenges to the international drug control system is that posed by the use of the Internet for drug trafficking. States must do more to enable the investigation of such illegal operations in order to ensure that such operations are identified, restricted and eliminated and that the international postal system is not used for illicit drug shipments. Internet pharmacies and other dispensing methods that physically separate the prescriber or provider from the patient pose a particular risk and require the development of more effective regulatory approaches. In such systems of supply, it is more difficult for prescribers and dispensers to evaluate the needs of patients to ensure that the prescriptions will be used for legitimate medical purposes so as to protect the health and well-being of the individual. States should be mindful of the challenges that such methods for the supply of medications may pose."

Not all parents have good digital skills, so they can't always help their children with online learning. We help children to master technology through remote support. The sustainability of the project is due to several factors: 1. Shortage of qualified IT specialists in many countries of the world, which indicates the demand for high-quality specialized educa1on now and in the future; 2. Stable demand for high-quality services for the addi1onal development of children in the field of digital technologies: According to the company's own marke1ng research, the number of children in the world who regularly ahend training centers in the field of digital technologies is growing by about 6-10% annually; 3. Addi1onal fullfledged educa1on in the format of an IT school. The project program implies long-term comprehensive training, which is designed for a period of up to 9 years and can take place in parallel with the basic educa1on and in addi1on to it; 4. Team of qualified specialists involved in the implementa1on of the project. The project team consists of specialists in programming and IT, management, marke1ng, and pedagogy. The total number of employees and developers is about 100 people; 5. Constant adjustment and upda1ng of the training program through the introduc1on of modern educa1onal modules, relevant training plaKorms, as well as interes1ng and non-standard tasks and projects for selfimplementa1on;6. Sources of stable financial flows: The volume of financial revenues of the company is formed through three permanent channels: training in its own divisions, the implementa1on of franchises (lump-sum contribu1ons), and regular payments by exis1ng franchisees (royal1es); 7. The possibility of replica1on of the project in any locality (popula1on size does not maher);8. The project's target audience is children and adolescents aged 6-14 (children at this age are especially suscep1ble to new knowledge, are interested in modern technologies, and ac1vely use gadgets, but use them mainly for entertainment) and their parents (they care about quality educa1on of their children, and precisely at the age of 6-14 invest the core capital in their development).

The environment in the country is more open and Thai trainers are very willing to share information and their expertise to Asian and international collaborating scientists. There are examples of successful promotion and commercialization of Peanut CRSP technologies, especially at the village-level involving small-scale entrepreneurs who mainly women. The Thai government has provided consistent supports for this project for the past 10 years. The ongoing impact study of past training courses would provide ways to improve the training program. Thailand is already the focal point for training Asian scientists and there are active village-level technology transfer activities to show participants. Participating countries in other regions should consider sending participants for training of trainers to Thailand and to get experience in field application and benefits derived from Peanut CRSP technologies. General: Peanut CRSP to enhance technology transfer and beneficiaries training in all Peanut CRSP projects. The experience in Thailand and the Philippines showed that active involvement of beneficiaries, through training and actual application, facilitated the promotion and commercialization of Peanut CRSP technologies.

"Interview with IBA: ""There has been an increase in English education in the last four years, and this will increase further in future. We provide training to students who are weak in English, so this will also result in the number of students familiar with English increasing."" English considered important to educational achievement English-medium schools are typically private schools that teach a state-set curriculum in English. The system is widespread in Pakistan, as all state universities require candidates to pass an in-house English language test. This underlines the importance of good English to a student's academic success. Levels of English are likely to improve over the next five years, following the government's decision to convert Urdu-medium schools to English. Every interviewee from educational institutions and companies said that demand for English language in the workplace will continue to rise, and this, coupled with government policy and individual ambition, will boost levels of fluency. The Pakistani Government is taking several steps to improve English teaching in the public education system: * In July 2010 the government appointed 50 English teachers to fringe parts of Islamabad such as Jaba Tall, Jaglot and Noorpur Shahan. This was accompanied by an increase in the fiscal budget allocated to education. * Efforts are being made to train teachers in English to ease the conversion of Urdu-medium schools to English. However, an article from Associated Press - 'Pakistan Sees Surge in Private Schools Over Failing Government System' - published in November 2009, noted that: ""Feudal structures in the rural areas [...] give landowners an incentive to keep farm workers uneducated and submissive."" This suggests that the improvement of rural education is likely to remain an uphill struggle. * At tertiary level, in a bid to improve the standard of English in public universities, the government launched Phase I of the English Language Teaching Reforms (ELTR) project in 2004. The ELTR has to date provided training to 1,540 teaching staff and updated teaching resources at 64 state-funded universities. Phase II of the ELTR project, launched in May 2010, aims to train another 1,400 teachers by 2013."

Without it we could not think of thoughts expressible to others, nor could we engage in the activities that commonly take place in the society we build ourselves (Di Pietro, 1994). Language is very important in education. The high status of English within a global economy of languages has meant that English language education is increasingly being promoted in international development initiatives. A broad goal of English language programs is that of developing the communicative ability to convey and interpret a message via written or spoken modalities to another person. In our country, there is no doubt that we still have not established a standard of education in schools and colleges. There are too many problems in our country that have to be eradicated to embrace a comprehensive education system through which we can expect ourselves to be a richer nation. We must not forget that students today will become the key members of our country who would be responsible for the overall development of our country. If we do not have good teacher, there is no way we could expect to have a balanced society in future. And if there are not enough good teachers in English, then there would be imbalance that the urban area students will be good at English, but students in rural areas would always be deprived of getting or learning English properly. The main objectives of teaching English in Bangladesh are to enable students to understand simple commands, instructions and requests in English and also carry them out. (national curriculum and textbook boards 2006). Most of the students of rural schools are unable to attain the primary English language competencies due to prevailing challenges in our education system. The main objective of this research is to find out the challenges and problems and prospects of English language teaching in rural areas in context of Bangladesh.

"The soon-to-be-launched New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) was said to make extensive provision for cooperative work on IAS within its draft programme on biodiversity conservation. In the afternoon, the two groups addressed three further questions: G. What are the existing resources that can be utilized to achieve regional cooperation? H. What additional resources are needed? i. Who needs to be involved? When and where? The results of these two groups deliberations on these three questions were then presented in plenary to all the workshop participants. Following this, the results of the two groups independent deliberations were integrated by a small task group. Their integration is presented below. It was agreed that the overall goal of the current workshop was ""Developing Regional Activities with Tangible Outputs."" National activities are implied within this, but what is sought is a not the sum total of national activities, but rather the beginnings of a regional strategy to address IAS. We should therefore define key issues to form a platform upon which we can have a major regional process (including a high-level workshop) that will lead to a comprehensive regional strategy. That will take time, and our focus here is to prioritize activities to kick-start the process. The following activities (Table 1) have been identified by delegates in answering the questions posed in the workshop sessions. What is now being sought is whether the synthesis team has done justice to the workshop outputs, in putting forward these priorities in terms of a joint commitment to regional activities with tangible outputs."

Both TIB surveys and a BBC Survey in 2005 confirmed that Bangladeshis have very little trust in the police. The major problems for the police include the role that politics plays in the transfer and posting of police officers. Working conditions are quite poor, and training and career opportunities reserved for senior level officers police do not attract sufficiently skilled and motivated staff. There is no support system for police and their families, housing and medical facilities for lower ranks are poor and welfare benefits in the case of accidents or death are not distributed in a timely manner. Other concerns relate to operational issues, e.g. the excessive workload and lack of operating budget for police stations.78 77 Ferdous J., From Rule of Law to Legal Empowerment of the Poor in Bangladesh: Towards an Agenda for Change. 78 Centre for governance studies. 2006.

Larger firms , state-owned enterprises , and businesses that import goods prioritized by the government 's development plan , as well as priority manufacturing export sectors ( textiles , leather , and agro-processing ) , and emergency food importation generally have priority access to foreign exchange .	The Central Bank of Ethiopia (known locally as the National Bank of Ethiopia, or NBE) administers a strict foreign currency control regime, and the local currency (the Ethiopian birr) is not freely convertible. All imports, exports, and outgoing foreign payments require a foreign exchange permit. Ethiopian commercial banks are licensed to issue these permits, except for coffee. Private banks are required to manage their foreign exchange transactions through correspondent banks. The central bank carefully monitors the foreign exchange holdings of these banks and closely manages the exchange rate. For the past six years, the central bank has allowed five to six percent depreciation of the domestic currency per year. The central bank unexpectedly devalued the domestic currency by 15 percent in early October 2017, following a serious foreign currency shortage. The central bank has allowed exporters, foreign investors, and domestic investors that generate foreign currency to acquire external loans and suppliers' credit upon prior registration and approval by the bank. Larger firms, state-owned enterprises, and businesses that import goods prioritized by the government's development plan, as well as priority manufacturing export sectors (textiles, leather, and agro-processing), and emergency food importation generally have priority access to foreign exchange. Despite priority status, they too are affected by the chronic foreign exchange shortage in the economy. In comparison, investors in non-priority sectors and less well-connected importers, particularly smaller, new-to-market firms, face long delays in arranging trade-related payments. On occasion, they may never be allocated any foreign currency at all. The unreliability of foreign currency supply in Ethiopia's banks hampers the ability of all manufacturers to import and restricts repatriation of profits.	Larger firms, state-owned enterprises, and businesses that import goods prioritized by the government's development plan, as well as priority manufacturing export sectors (textiles, leather, and agro-processing), and emergency food importation generally have priority access to foreign exchange.

The prospects for U.S. service suppliers in China should be promising, given the size of China's market. Nevertheless, while the United States maintained a $40.2 billion surplus in trade in services with China in FOREIGN TRADE BARRIERS | 109 2017 (latest data available), the U.S. share of China's services market remained well below the U.S. share of the global services market. In 2018, numerous challenges persisted in a range of services sectors. As in past years, Chinese regulators continued to use case-by-case approvals, discriminatory regulatory processes, informal bans on entry and expansion, overly burdensome licensing and operating requirements, and other means to frustrate the efforts of U.S. suppliers of services to achieve their full market potential in China. These policies and practices affect U.S. service suppliers across a wide range of sectors, including banking, securities and asset management, insurance, electronic payments, cloud computing, telecommunications, online video and entertainment software, film production and distribution, and express delivery. In addition, China's Cybersecurity Law and related draft and final implementing measures include mandates to purchase domestic information and communications technology products and services, restrictions on cross-border data flows and requirements to store and process data locally, all of which undermine U.S. services suppliers' ability to take advantage of market access opportunities in China.

While judicial reforms are moving forward , bribes , extortion , and political considerations continue to influence outcomes in court cases .	Corruption remains a substantial barrier to doing business in Kenya. U.S. firms continue to report they find it difficult to succeed against competitors willing to ignore legal standards or engage in bribery and other forms of corruption. Corruption is widely reported to affect government procurement tender processes at both the national and county level. The government has not implemented anti-corruption laws effectively. U.S. firms routinely report direct requests for bribes from all levels of the Kenyan government. The Kenyan government began an anticorruption campaign using the Ethics and Anticorruption Commission (EACC) and Office of the Director of Public Prosecution to open cases against high profile offenders. While some cases brought to light by the EACC have resulted in convictions, no high-profile cases have ended in conviction. Despite efforts to increase efficiency and public confidence in the judiciary, a backlog of cases and continuing corruption - both perceived and real - reduce the credibility and effectiveness of Kenya's judicial system. While judicial reforms are moving forward, bribes, extortion, and political considerations continue to influence outcomes in court cases. An Employment and Labor Relations Court exists in Kenya, but it is plagued by long delays in rendering judgments. As such, foreign and local investors risk lengthy and costly legal procedures.

The operation of leasing does not require a strong lending infrastructure. Indeed, as Berger and Udell (2006) underline, a weak regulatory environment that does not support the use of collateral and bankruptcy rights may encourage the use of alternative instruments, where the lender owns the asset. At the same time, leasing can be difficult to implement in countries that lack a national asset register, as illegal on-selling of leased assets is easier, or with weak laws on repossession, which undermine the ability of the lessor to repossess the asset in the case of default (USAID, 2009). 140. The development of leasing also depends on the rules that govern the institutions offering lease services. Leasing companies are typically non-deposit taking institutions and are therefore subject to less stringent capital requirements than banks, which may allow them higher leverage. On the other hand, the cost of money can be higher for these institutions, as they have to source funding from more volatile and expensive markets (Gallardo, 1997). In some countries, however, minimum capital requirements are imposed on non-bank lessors, implying limitation of lending to a proportion of their net asset value. 141. Tax regulation may affect leasing decision of firms, although the empirical evidence is not conclusive in this regard (Lasfer and Levis, 1998). In principle, tax breaks can make the leasing option advantageous over bank financing, particularly in the case of operational lease. In this case lessees can offset their full lease payments against income before tax, compared to the depreciation allowance or the interest charges on bank loans. In the case of finance lease deduction applies only to the interest component of the payment. The overall tax benefits of finance lease, however, depend on the type of asset leased and the rules over depreciation, which can be claimed by the lessee in its balance sheet. In addition, lessors may be able to pass on to lessees some tax benefits related to their depreciation charges as owners of the asset leased, by lowering their financing costs (Gallardo, 1997).	On the other hand, the cost of money can be higher for these institutions, as they have to source funding from more volatile and expensive markets (Gallardo, 1997).

Jobs are transformational PART1 Introduction to Part 1 Economic development is about improvements in living standards supported by productivity growth. It also involves social change associated with urbanization, integration in the world economy, and the drive toward gender equality. All of these transformations are related to jobs. The development process is about some jobs becoming better and others disappearing, about people taking jobs and changing jobs, and about jobs migrating to other places within and across countries. Development often entails the movement of labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly subsistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and mostly market-oriented activities. This movement transforms the lives of families and communities, the organization of firms, and the norms and values of societies. It can boost productivity and improve living standards and also affect the cohesiveness of society. Jobs are thus a key driver of development. * Living standards: Jobs provide earnings opportunities to lift people out of poverty, raise their consumption, and contribute to individual well-being more broadly. * Productivity: Through job creation and destruction within sectors and reallocations across sectors and countries, jobs are also at the root of economic growth. * Social cohesion: Jobs define who people are in many ways; by shaping values and be-DEVELOPMENT JOBS LIVING STANDARDS PRODUCTIVITY SOCIAL COHESION haviors, they can influence trust and civic engagement.

Aspects of Service Exports Services can be crucial in stimulating goods exports and are critical in maintaining those transactions. Many U.S. merchandise exports would not take place if they were not supported by such service activities as banking, insurance, and transportation. The many obvious differences between services and products include differences in tangibility and customer involvement. Because services are intangible, you may find that communicating a service offer is more difficult than communicating a product offer. Also, services frequently must be tailored to the specific needs of the client. Such adaptation often necessitates the client's direct participation and cooperation. Involving the client, in turn, calls for interpersonal skills and cultural sensitivity on the part of the service provider.

Despite these obstacles , agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance .	Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case that is important to understand, especially given its starting point. The government has provided some support, with export processing zones, bonded warehouses, and special treatment of garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have made it easier to move around the country. But government has not played the leading role in the transformation. Corruption is a problem and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution associated with the development and diffusion of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture through industrialization, and social policies made garment industry has been an important part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. About 3 million women are working in this sector, which has a strong export orientation. Construction has been an important employer for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing by about 10 percent every year.37 Light manufacturing opens up opportunities for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest. Firms demand some education but it is generally limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some education but only 28 percent had secondary schooling or more.38 These education levels are considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so opportunities in the garment industry stimulate schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To the extent that women's educational attainment and labor market participation rise, the status of women in society is enhanced.

"The increase in material published is undoubtedly related to the salience of migration in policy, political as well as public spheres. We have witnessed the increasing use of migration - or more correctly at times, anti-immigration - as a political tool, despite the existing evidence base showing that there has not been substantive changes in migration (levels or processes) to warrant such significant shifts in the public debate (see chapter 5 of this report for discussion). It is understandable that researchers, working on academic or applied research, or in white or grey literature, have been inspired to seek and report the truth during a period in which we witnessed ""fake news"" and ""disinformation"" increasingly take hold in public debates on migration globally. 156 Migration research and analysis: Growth, reach and recent contributions Consistent with the findings of World Migration Report 2018, there is certainly a strong case to be made for playing to the strengths of the different types of research published on migration. Some of the highest quality blogs on migration, for example, are based on carefully elaborated and conducted studies, and insightful analysis drawing on years of research. They also are able to garner significant interest, with data clearly showing extended reach to wider audiences that lay beyond the scientific. The use of blog platforms by influential migration academics to communicate their empirical and theoretical research findings to policy and general audiences demonstrates the relevance of the form. We are also seeing recognition of this in the calculation of how research impact is measured. The growing use of altmetrics, for example, which measure a journal article's reach in non-academic publishing, points to the increasing need to extend knowledge based on rigorous research and analysis into wider audiences. However, this should not be at the expense of the bedrock provided by scientific research, with its focus on meeting high quality standards."

Angel investing is increasingly encouraged and supported by policy makers in many countries , as a way to mobilize financial resources and entrepreneurial expertise towards dynamic new ventures .	Policies 405. Angel investing is increasingly encouraged and supported by policy makers in many countries, as a way to mobilize financial resources and entrepreneurial expertise towards dynamic new ventures. In most cases, supply-side measures have been introduced, which mainly take the form of tax incentives and public co-investment. Given the local dimension of angel investing, in some countries, such as the US and Canada, support is provided at the local level rather than at the national level. 47 see www.eban.org 406. Front-end and back-end tax incentives aim to increase the number of BAs as well as the amount of capital invested. Typically, incentives are conditional on the shares being held for a minimum number of years or the capital gains being reinvested in new ventures. For instance, in 2008, Italy introduced tax relief for business angel investments, which consists of a tax exemption for capital gains on the sale of a startups' undertakings, provided that the start-up is less than seven years old, that the investor holds the shares for at least three years, and that the capital gains are reinvested in another start-up in the next two years (OECD, 2014b). 407. Japan has introduced an angel tax system since 1997, which comprises reduced taxation on capital gains and carry forward of losses. However, as angel taxation was only used for a small amount of investments, to further increase angel funding, the system was amended in recent years with the introduction of an income exemption system, whereby, under specific conditions, BAs can deduct from their annual income an amount of money substantially equivalent to the investment carried out in the same year (OECD, 2011a). 408. Another common supply-side measure consists in the creation of co-investment funds, which match public funds with those of private investors that are approved under the scheme. In some cases these funds target all seed and early stage investors, including also VC funds (see Box 9), but there exists also programmes that are especially focused on BAs. In the UK, the Angel CoFund invests amounts of GBP 100,000 to GBP 1 million into SMEs with high growth potential, working in partnership with syndicates of experienced BAs.

Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions , and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle .	"Part 2 Ecological accounting How do we live, produce and consume? The Footprint does not only quantify the availability and consumption of a country's natural resources, it also can measure sustainability at the personal, city, and institutional levels. There are a variety of ways to calculate a sub-national Footprint. Regional or municipal average per capita Footprints are calculated by scaling the national results up or down, based on the differences between national and local consumption patterns. This can be done using the ""inputoutput approach"" based on monetary, physical or hybrid input-output tables for allocated overall demand to consumption categories. Sub-national Footprint accounting can raise questions about our personal actions, and it helps us make decisions for a more sustainable lifestyle. Tools, such as the Ecological Footprint personal calculator foster our creativity and test our personal consumption habits. Although national and regional policies are critical in building a sustainable economy, we as individuals can also make our mark: We elect our political representatives, choose our mode of transport, and we decide what products to consume. It is pertinent that we demand more sustainable actions from our decision makers, and ourselves, at communal, national and global levels. In Part 5 of this brochure we will look further into national and global Ecological Footprint results. In the following text, we will examine the Footprint dimensions, calculation developments and case studies. the personal ecological Footprint Do you have a car, and if yes, how much do you use it? How often do you eat meat products? In what kind of a house do you live? Is it a single-or multi-family dwelling? How much do you spend on electricity per month? Such are the questions you will encounter when calculating your personal Ecological Footprint online. At the end of the quiz, you are presented with the number of global hectares needed to support your given lifestyle. This number is then converted into how many planet Earths would infobox: Footprint calculator There are many different Footprint calculators available, on vast numbers of Web sites."

Most countries have their own definitions of education levels that do not easily correspond to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels. Consequently, the UIS works with countries to map their education systems to the ISCED classification with a view to improving cross-country and -temporal comparisons. Despite UIS' guidance to countries to exclude data on programmes designed for people beyond regular school age, adult education data may still be included for a few countries, which may slightly affect the comparability of their enrolment data with those of other countries.

In Guyana , the gender composition of workshop participants has varied depending on the topic offered .	In Guyana, the gender composition of workshop participants has varied depending on the topic offered. When value-adding and postharvest processing technologies were discussed, about 65% of the participants were women, while attendance at field days focused on production practices were dominated by men. Most of the small-scale processors that provide peanut butter to the lunch program of the local schools are women. Women, children, and indigenous peoples are usually disadvantaged groups in rural farming areas in most developing countries. Because of the great importance of peanut to these people and the opportunity for this crop to contribute to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) on gender equity, the Peanut CRSP could become a flagship program for gender equity efforts. To assure that the highest possible gender equity benefit is achieved, Peanut CRSP projects should include (in their design) strategies to ensure that women, children, and indigenous groups benefit directly from future technological interventions (i.e., disease-resistant peanut varieties, aflatoxinfree peanut products, etc.) by Peanut CRSP. Additional experience working on gender issues in Peanut CRSP research in a host country like Uganda would enhance gender awareness in research in agriculture and health-related issues that Peanut CRSP could build upon to improve its collaborative work in developing countries.

This project falls into two discrete parts at the University of Georgia (Dr. David Wilson, CO-Principal Investigator) and at the University of Wisconsin (Dr. Nancy Keller, CO-Principal Investigator). These parts are to be considered separately as follows: (1) Concerning the work undertaken at the University of Georgia, there is unquestionably a need in developing countries for low-cost robust methods of analysis for aflatoxins. There are Project UWI49F - 135 - requirements both to screen out highly contaminated peanuts to remove from the food chain and in some cases to screen for purposes of export. Existing commercial affinity column based semi-quantitative screening methods work extremely well but are very expensive due to the high prices of imported affinity columns. Using the VICAM system of clean-up on an affinity column then brominating and measuring fluorescence in a small fluorimeter, the aim has been to replace the affinity column with a low cost alumina-based column which can be made from locally available materials. Using acetone extraction, bromination and fluorescence measurement a limit of detection of 5 ppb for total aflatoxins has been achieved and 300-400 samples can be analyzed per day. The approach does need validation and it is recommended that this should be carried out with a major involvement of developing countries.

Of the 158 countries with data for 2012 (or the latest year over the period 2005-2012), 74 attained gender parity in adult literacy, 4 countries showed disparities to the disadvantage of men and 80 to the disadvantage of women. Women's literacy rates were less than two thirds those of men's in 22 of those countries, four of which are located in Southern Asia (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan), one in Western Asia (Yemen), and the rest in sub-Saharan Africa.55 The vast majority of young men and women have basic reading and writing skills The vast majority of young people (aged 15 to 24) in the world are literate. Over the period 1990- 2012, the global literacy rate for young women rose from 79 to 87 per cent and from 88 to 92 per cent for young men (figure 3.17). This reflects increased participation in formal schooling among younger generations. Youth literacy is almost universal in the more developed regions, in Eastern Asia and in the Caucasus and Central Asia; it is close to being universal in Latin America and in South-Eastern Asia. In parts of the world where many boys and girls do not attend school or drop out, youth literacy rates are much lower than global averages. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the rates are among the lowest in the world, only 64 per cent of young women and 76 per cent of young men are literate. In Oceania and Southern Asia, young men and women have attained basic literacy skills at rates significantly lower than the global averages for each sex.

The sharing of inputs , better labor matching , and knowledge spillovers are the main forces behind the geographical concentration of industries and economic activity in urban environments .	Agglomeration effects. The spatial concentration of activity is a strong driver of productivity growth in developing countries. Effects can materialize within sectors (localization economies) or between sectors (urbanization economies). The sharing of inputs, better labor matching, and knowledge spillovers are the main forces behind the geographical concentration of industries and economic activity in urban environments. The sharing of inputs facilitates the emergence of specialized producers of intermediate goods and services. Proximity allows firms to more easily find workers to fill positions. Knowledge spillovers allow firms to learn about new technologies, products, and practices from other firms operating in the vicinity. These agglomeration effects signal a difference between the private and social values of jobs.

19d27943-fc0e-11ed-88fc-93f4be02dfa8	neigbor32.txt	Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities.	Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities .	Data and analysis can be used to identify misaligned incentives, indicated by a gap between the individual and the social value of jobs. Several research areas deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can measure the tax burden that applies to capital and labor and assess the crosssubsidization between individuals or firms. The methods of labor economics can uncover gaps between the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings, or between the social and individual returns to schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, or the locations where job creation would have a greater impact on reducing poverty. Productivity studies allow for quantifying the spillovers from employment in foreign-owned investment companies, or in cities. Environmental studies shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs. And valA simple approach to setting policy priorities follows five steps (figure 19): * Step one: What are good jobs for development? Assessing the development payoffs from jobs in a particular country context is the first step in identifying priorities. The nature of those jobs varies with the characteristics of the country, including its phase of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges are not the same in agrarian economies, resource-rich countries, conflict-affected countries, or in countries with high youth unemployment. And the jobs with the greatest development impact differ as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. * Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under way, the development value of new manufacturing jobs might materialize. But it might not if, for example, inadequate urbanization policies limit the establishment of new firms.

Help improve tobacco control worldwide. The American Cancer Society Global Cancer Control department and the Economic and Health Policy Research (EHPR) program in the Intramural Research department are working to end the worldwide tobacco epidemic through research and programs. In 2016, the two teams launched a global tobacco taxation initiative that promotes the Sustainable Development Goal of a 30% reduction in smoking prevalence by 2025. This program actively seeks to engage specific cancer organizations, most of which have not been previously involved in this area, particularly in LMICs, and also provides capacity building and technical assistance to interested organizations and governments. Further, because issues around illicit trade in tobacco products have been closely tied to tobacco taxation, the initiative takes advantage of the EHPR's knowledge and experience to help governments navigate the challenges around implementing tobacco taxation successfully amid tobacco industry opposition.

Our analysis strongly suggests that a range of interacting contextual factors prevent the emergence of resilient , high-return rice cropping livelihoods .	Investigations have been made into the use of resilience as a concept to guide development. These studies have focused on the following: identifying which economic units are or are not resilient; the differential impacts of shocks on these units; and the responses of different economic units to these shocks (Hoddinott 2006, Carter et al. 2007, Akter and Mallick 2013, Constas et al. 2014, Alfani et al. 2015, Jain et al. 2015, Cisse and Barrett 2016). Analysis of this nature enables interventions to be targeted to increase the resistance of farmers to hazards, e.g., flood resistant seeds (Dar et al. 2013) or enable ex post coping (e.g., Akter et al. 2016). Our work builds upon the arguments of Bene et al. (2016a) and Enfors (2013) in highlighting the importance of contextual factors to explain resilience in farmers. Our analysis strongly suggests that a range of interacting contextual factors prevent the emergence of resilient, high-return rice cropping livelihoods. Agricultural interventions need to take into account these contextual factors to shift rice cropping onto a trajectory toward resilience. Our context-based analysis shows how rice cultivation and the prevailing social norms, formal institutions, and economy interact to shape coping capacity and the distribution of resilience. We argue that context based studies that explain how resilience occurs and resilience measurement studies that monitor economic units pre-and postshock are complementary. Contextbased studies can explain why differential levels of postdisaster resilience occur. Such complementary analysis will likely lead to more sustainable and effective resilience building interventions.	Our analysis strongly suggests that a range of interacting contextual factors prevent the emergence of resilient, high-return rice cropping livelihoods.

In 2012, the EU approved the applications for use of two terms, ""cream"" and ""classic,"" but the EU's delayed application approval process for other terms continues to be a significant concern. The United States has repeatedly raised this issue in the WTO TBT Committee in recent years and also has pursued bilateral discussions. Beyond approving the two terms, the EU has not taken any visible steps to address U.S. concerns. In 2013, the Commission started discussions with the Member States on a possible simplification of wine labeling set out in Regulation 607/2009. In May 2018, the EU notified to the WTO draft regulations related to wine labeling. However, the draft regulations do not appear to resolve the concerns, particularly as relates to the use of ""traditional terms.""

Spain 's main points of attraction are its excellent natural ( 9th ) and cultural ( 3rd ) resources , with the latter being its greatest advantage relative to the rest of the world .	Selected Country/Economy Analysis Spain remains the most competitive economy in the world when it comes to T&T. The nation is the second-most visited destination in the world and has developed an economy that is focused on tourism, with over half of internal T&T spending coming from international visitors. Spain's main points of attraction are its excellent natural (9th) and cultural (3rd) resources, with the latter being its greatest advantage relative to the rest of the world. The country is a centre for international meetings (4th) and sporting events and has the strongest combination of intangible culture and heritage sites (1st) in the world. The number of UNESCO-recognized Natural Heritage sites has also increased (11th to 9th), helping to boost the attractiveness of its natural assets (23rd to 10th). Servicing travellers is an exceptional tourism infrastructure (3rd), including a high hotel density. Intra-country travel is supported by quality railroads (11th) and roads (13th), while good port infrastructure (12th) could help the cruise industry. The nation's many international arrivals can rely on strong air transport infrastructure (10th), which includes a wide range of operating airlines (5th) that provide a considerable route capacity (8th). Moreover, like much of higher-income Europe, the country performs well in areas related to its overall enabling environment (33rd), with a solid global relative advantage on ICT readiness (27th) and security (16th).

In a fourth study , from Ethiopia , certification was one among many topics discussed with interviewees who represented a scoped community mobilization project ( 98 ) .	"To reduce CHW drop-out rates and to ensure a sense of commitment to service, an earlier review suggested that CHW programmes should set up clear appointment and deployment strategies for CHWs who pass the final exam at the end of a training and receive a certificate of course completion (13). However, there is little formal evidence that suggests that certification improves outcomes. In this section, the guideline explores the evidence and provides policy guidance on competency-based, formal certification for CHWs who have successfully completed pre-service training. 7.5.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that the very limited evidence points to a positive, though largely untested, potential of formal credentialing of CHWs. While credentialing may in theory negatively impact equity (by limiting the number of CHWs authorized to practise to those awarded a formal licence, thereby restricting access to services), in many contexts it can be a pathway to greater competency of CHWs (and hence improved patient safety through better quality of care). Further, it can enhance credibility, recognition and employability of CHWs. On this basis, the GDG supported a conditional recommendation in favour of formal certification. 7.5.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.5) addressing the question - ""For community health workers who have received pre-service training, should competency-based formal certification be used versus not?"" (96) - identified four eligible qualitative studies that reported on how certification processes were perceived by small, non-representative samples of CHWs. Two studies were conducted in the United States, one of which reported on state-based credentialing of CHWs occurring in four states (68), while the other summarized certification experience from New York City (97). A national view on certification was also included in a study from the Islamic Republic of Iran, where certification is the norm and is required to achieve employment as a CHW (75). In a fourth study, from Ethiopia, certification was one among many topics discussed with interviewees who represented a scoped community mobilization project (98)."

The Republic of Moldova is continuing to strengthen law enforcement , border protection , regional cooperation and information-sharing to prevent drug trafficking within and through the country .	(F ) Republic of Moldova 184. A mission of the Board visited the Republic of Moldova in May 2015. The objective of the mission was to review the drug control situation in the country and the Government's compliance with the three international drug control conventions to which the Republic of Moldova is a party. 185. Since the last INCB mission to the country in 1996, the Government has made significant progress in some areas of drug control. The Permanent Committee on Drug Control and the Republican Narcology Dispensary have taken measures to fully implement the provisions of the international drug control treaties. In particular, the Government has taken noticeable steps to address the emerging problems generated by increasing levels of drug abuse and the need to provide the affected population with adequate treatment, including opioid substitution therapy. In order to ensure the adoption of targeted and effective drug control policies, regular national surveys on drug abuse, particularly among youth, may be of benefit. 186. Despite the progress achieved, significant challenges remain. The Republic of Moldova continues to be used as a transit country for illicit drug shipments and precursor chemicals trafficked through its territory to markets in Europe. The Republic of Moldova is continuing to strengthen law enforcement, border protection, regional cooperation and information-sharing to prevent drug trafficking within and through the country. 187. The availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances used for medical purposes in the country is very low. The Government may need to assess the requirements for those substances, identify possible impediments to their availability and ensure that narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are available to those in need in adequate quantities.

The risk of living in poverty declines with the acquisition of basic cognitive skills, especially numeracy and literacy, and the associated enhancement in earning opportunities. Skills, especially cognitive abilities, are strongly related to productivity growth, more so than school attendance rates.71 They also are closely associated with structural transformation, especially for low-and lower-middle-income countries where they create opportunities for people outside of agriculture.72 Across 1,500 subnational regions in 110 countries, education emerges as the critical determinant of knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurship.73 And skills can shape how jobs link people to neighbors, communities, and societies.74 But around the world, available skills are not fitting well with the demands of the economy. Skills mismatches are arguably growing rather than shrinking. Albeit not easy to pinpoint, up to one-third of the employed in countries as diverse as Brazil, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania are either under-or over-qualified for the work they do.75 Managers of registered, formal firms around the world judge workforce skills as an obstacle of above-average importance in the production process.76 In countries at all development levels, skills obstacles are also judged to be more acute now than in the first half of the 2000s (figure 5.13).

Education influences access to employment opportunities. Education contributes both to the occupations where individuals work, as well as the productivity in these occupations. Patterns of occupational selection are rather strong in Coted'Ivoire. Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agriculture, and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary education or more. The share of nonagricultural self-employment is relatively stable across levels of education, although it slightly decreases at secondary levels and above (Figure1.10). Education is a key determinant of access to certain types of job. As such, stronger gender differences in educational attainment contribute to the strong gender differences in occupation. Box 1.4 further describes the likelihood of employment in the main types of employment given individual characteristics (gender, education) while controlling for other situational factors (social origin, region of residence). Results show that the descriptive patterns of occupational selection by educational level are strong.

The recent political rapprochement with Eritrea, along with the GOE's recent purchase of a 19 percent share of Berbera Port in Somaliland, which is being developed by DP World, could also provide alternative routes to transport goods to markets, and should eventually improve logistics.	Most goods continue to be transported by trucks to the Port of Djibouti; Ethiopia's government-owned trucking companies dominate the market, and the overall number of trucks is insufficient to meet demand.

Data collection by CHWs is a potentially meaningful yet still underresearched pathway towards improving community health services ( 14 ) .	"For the latter purpose, the inherent assumption is that enhanced expertise and skills will translate into improved service delivery, thereby improving the outcomes of community health interventions. Data collection by CHWs is a potentially meaningful yet still underresearched pathway towards improving community health services (14). This potential should be balanced with data ownership, access and individual patient confidentiality issues. 7.11.2 Rationale for recommendation The GDG noted that most published evidence supports a role for CHWs in data collection and use, and this finding is consistent with the broader literature on health information systems and quality improvement. As the evidence base is characterized by a low level of certainty and considering that the most appropriate strategies may vary by context, the GDG adopted a conditional recommendation in favour of the policy option under consideration. Recognizing the potential pitfalls of overburdening CHWs with data collection tasks, the GDG focused on identifying enablers for successful CHW contributions to data collection, collation and use. 7.11.3 Summary of evidence The systematic review (Annex 6.11) on the question - ""In the context of community health worker (CHW) programmes, should practising CHWs collect, collate, and use health data versus not?"" (168) - identified as eligible for inclusion eight quantitative, four qualitative and two mixed methods studies, conducted in seven sub-Saharan African countries and Brazil, Cambodia and the United States."

As households get richer , the demand for food as a share of total spending goes down and so does the demand from agriculture for labor .	As households get richer, the demand for food as a share of total spending goes down and so does the demand from agriculture for labor. It has been widely observed across history that as countries develop, the share of agriculture in the economy and employment declines (Figure2.1). These structural and occupational transformations at the macro level reflect people's demand behavior at the micro level, that is, their relatively larger demand for non-food than for food as they get richer.15 As a result, the share of spending on food declines as incomes rise (widely known as Engel's Law), even though, in absolute terms, spending on food still increases. At the macro level this translates in a declining share of agriculture in GDP as countries develop, as well as a declining share of employment in agriculture.	As households get richer, the demand for food as a share of total spending goes down and so does the demand from agriculture for labor.

The main challenge facing resource-rich countries is to spread the wealth in ways that do not undermine productivity growth and social cohesion spillovers. Good jobs for development in this context are those that generate output (as opposed to just absorbing it) outside the extractive industries sector. Incentives for firms to create jobs and for people to work are important if the economy is going to diversify its export base. The abundance of foreign currency can be a constraint because of exchange rate appreciation. The experience of some countries, most notably Norway, shows how sovereign funds that are used for long-run investments can manage this foreign currency problem.

The spatial concentration of activity is a strong driver of productivity growth in developing countries.

International economics analyzes the resource allocation and innovation impetus provided by employment in export sectors and foreign-owned companies .	Several disciplines in economics and in the social sciences focus on the channels through which spillovers from jobs occur, even if they may not articulate it that way. One core focus of labor economics is to assess earnings differentials and their causes, including discrimination, uneven bargaining power, regulation, and taxation. The public finance literature also evaluates the impact on employment, capital intensity, and earnings of taxes and subsidies, including those used to finance social insurance contributions. Gender studies examine the economic, social, and cultural determinants of gender discrimination and their relationships to employment. Poverty analyses study the poverty and inequality impact of job distributions and different growth patterns. Economic geography uncovers the productivity impact of spatial concentration of jobs. International economics analyzes the resource allocation and innovation impetus provided by employment in export sectors and foreign-owned companies. Environmental economics measures and values the negative (and positive) impacts of employment in different sectors, or using different techniques, on the natural resource base. Identity economics researches how behaviors and norms are influenced by the relationship between people and their peer groups, including through their jobs. The field of equity analysis has started to examine BOX 5.4 Economics and the social sciences deal with spillovers from jobs, under different names the degree to which job outcomes are shaped by the circumstances in which individuals are born, as opposed to their ability or effort.

"Beyond labor policies 313 QUESTION 9 Creative destruction, the mainstay of economic growth, happens to a large extent through labor reallocation. As workers move from jobs in low-productivity farms and obsolete firms to jobs in more dynamic economic units, output increases and the economy moves closer to the efficiency frontier. Differences in productivity across economic units underlie this creative destruction process. Such differences can reflect a healthy ecosystem driven by competition which offers the basis for efficiencyenhancing job reallocation. Market imperfections and government failures may hinder labor reallocation, however, resulting in a wider dispersion of productivity and many missed opportunities for growth.120 Stringent regulations that obstruct the movement of workers from low-to high-productivity areas or that prevent their separation from obsolete firms are a case in point. These regulations may stem from good intentions, such as containing congestion in cities or providing earnings stability to workers. But their cost in productivity growth can be substantial. Regulations of this kind do not sit on the efficiency ""plateau"" where labor policies are mainly redistributive; they are rather on the cliff, and have unambiguously negative effects on economic efficiency."

The current Peanut CRSP Grant began in 1996 with program adjustments made in 2001 based on the 2000 EEP Review. The peanut CRSP uses a value-chain approach developed around five thematic or cluster areas: (1) food safety and nutrition; (2) production efficiency; (3) socioeconomics and policy; (4) Post-Harvest and utilization; and (5) information, training and technology transfer and management. Program content assured that the Title XII expectations of impact in the host (developing) countries with benefits to the United States (U.S.A.) would be achieved. Plans were developed to resolve major constraints to the host countries and U.S.A. peanut sector and to ensure that social and gender issues were addressed. This 2004-2005 review concluded that the Peanut CRSP had been highly effective in developing technologies through research in the five thematic/cluster areas, and the technologies transferred to farmers, entrepreneurs, and key stakeholders have resulted in significant impacts in the host countries and the U.S.A.

Some of the ex-Desh workers joined new garment factories established by affluent businessmen , while others founded trading houses , which then BOX 3 .	The garment industry in Bangladesh illustrates how important it is to learn advanced management practices, marketing, and technologies from abroad. When Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up with Bangladesh's Desh Ltd. to produce garments for export in Bangladesh in 1979, the South Asian country had no modern industry. Little more than 20 years later, the industry was generating more than US$12.5 billion in export revenue. Women accounted for 80 percent of its 3.6 million workers Arguably, a wide set of factors, from financial innovation to policy support, contributed to this development success. But it began in 1979, when Desh sent 130 newly recruited, educated employees to Daewoo's garment factory in Korea, where they participated in an eight-month intensive training course covering topics from sewing skills to factory management, quality control, and international procurement and marketing--skills that they then applied in the Desh factories in Bangladesh. Within a few years, almost all the trainees had left Desh to start their own garment businesses.

A large number of students receive private supplementary tutoring in English in Bangladesh. Payment-based private supplementary tutoring has also spread all over the world, both in developed and developing countries-from east to the west. The aim of this study is to find out the reasons and necessity of private tutoring in English for Bangla medium school students in Bangladesh. Besides, It will be also investigated that private tutoring has any positive effects or not. To conduct this research, thirty five respondents were surveyed successfully with a written questionnaire. And classroom observation was done successfully to find out where there was any lacking in English teaching or not. The findings from the survey show that most of the primary level learners receive private tutoring and they are satisfied with the English lesson provided by their private tutor rather than their school teacher. But learners should not fully depend on private tutor. Private tuition has both positive and negative effects. Parents and learners should recognize the importance of private tutoring in English and also be aware about negative effects of it.

Farmers , although few women appear to be involved , will benefit from improved food security and higher income through adoption of new technologies .	There has already been a major impact in production in a very short time. Increased production has impacted negatively, as over-production has already occurred. However, there is potential for increased local consumption, and alternate uses and new products need to be investigated. There is interest, and potential benefit, from developing cottage industries, where peanut products could be used in school feeding projects. The children dislike the powdered milk currently used. The increased production already achieved has stimulated the industry, and raised interest in exports. Traders from Georgetown have shown interest, and sales into these markets have resulted in 20% increases in net returns. However, distances from the port and poor road communication operate against realizing this potential. Farmers, although few women appear to be involved, will benefit from improved food security and higher income through adoption of new technologies. Processors and consumers will benefit from better quality, nutritionally superior, and safe foods, particularly for children. Development of alternate uses may help to overcome over-production.

Technology transfer has been achieved through partnerships with multiple stakeholders .	The program has also focused on the connection between agriculture and health (particularly aflatoxin and immunity in humans) now being recognized as important by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The earlier discoveries of enterosorption of aflatoxin are providing a totally new approach to the management of this problem in developing countries. Major impacts have been realized in the animal feeding industries worldwide and the importance of this research has been recognized by BIFAD. The program has been successful in adapting cutting edge science to host country problems. Contributions have been made in biotechnology, health science, food technology, and socio-economic analyses. International exchanges have benefited U.S. agriculture through improved germplasm, integrated pest management, and non-traditional peanut products. The early decision to work across the full value chain of the crop was visionary, since the program is already addressing the new USAID Peanut CRSP External Evaluation Report 2005 - 31 - strategic plan. One of the lessons learned from the past program was to match projects addressing production with projects creating demand. The extensive list of achievements and benefits to both the U.S.A. and the host countries is an indication of the quality and commitment of scientists participating in the program. Technology transfer has been achieved through partnerships with multiple stakeholders. The Peanut CRSP has been very successful in expanding its budget, and in leveraging funds from other sources.

Beijing lawyer Jiang Tianyong, who went missing in November 2016 and ""confessed"" at a trial in August to fabricating the torture account of lawyer Xie Yang by Chinese police and attending overseas workshops to discuss changing China's political system, was sentenced in November to two years' imprisonment for ""inciting subversion of state power"".

Beijing human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, held in incommunicado detention since the beginning of the crackdown, was still awaiting trial at the end of the year, charged with ""subverting state power"". In January, an interview transcript with Xie Yang was published in which he said he faced torture and other ill-treatment during detention. Xie Yang was released on bail without a verdict in May after his trial. On 26 December, the court announced his conviction on the charge of ""inciting subversion of state power"" but ruled that he was ""exempt from criminal punishment"". He remained under surveillance."

Part 2 Ecological accounting in 2005 Africa had an ecological reserve of 0.4 gha per person. The reserve will likely not persist, however, as the per capita biocapacity of Africa decreased by about one-fifth between 1990 and 2003 alone, driven by an expanding population.

The average Footprint of an African measured 1.4 gha in 2005, a reduction of 20 percent since 1961, and is the smallest of all the world's regions.

Winners and losers The obvious winners of globalization are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered tasks have migrated. Outsourcing and offshoring, along with the attendant transfer of new technologies and advanced management methods, contributes to productivity growth and improvements in living standards. The development of more efficient industries and services encourage a reallocation of labor toward more productive uses. It also stimulates the subsequent development of other interrelated industries and sectors through backward and forward linkages. The development of a modern services sector can lead to greater coordination in value chains and make a further subdivision of tasks and the reorganization of production possible, leading to economies of scale.55 Multiple actors--including multinationals, civil society organizations and consumers in industrial countries--are increasingly active in efforts to improve working conditions and workers' rights in developing countries. To the extent that such efforts bear fruit, enhanced export opportunities improve workers' well-being.56 In all these ways, significant trickle-down effects can have widespread benefits for recipient countries.

The development of credit risk assessment technologies has favoured the consolidation and broader diffusion of POF. POF, factoring and trade finance, as we know them today, date back to the Middle Ages, to the business practices of English factors in the 14th through the 17th centuries, as England grew from an agrarian economy to a modern commercial economy. These practices evolved out of experiences of banks in 13th century Italy, which were grounded in factoring practices of the Roman Empire5. Throughout centuries, POF was provided by financial intermediaries engaged in a relationship model with customers, where the purchase order would act as sufficient collateral to finance the project (Davidson, 1986). In recent decades, particularly since the 1990s, the advances in technological platforms to assess risk facilitated the development of POF as an instrument to fund SMEs (van der Vliet et al., 2013), without restricting this to the relationship lending business model.

It is important to stress the BRI is not a trading bloc as such. However, it does contain within it a number of trading blocs and these interact with the EU and NAFTA blocs. Some part of the success of the BRI strategy will ultimately turn on the 'connectivity' dividends of China's infrastructure investment for facilitating commerce between these blocs and with other countries generally. Some very preliminary evidence is set out based on a gravity model of bilateral trade and explained in Annex A. The dependent variable (Xijt) is the exports from origin country i to destination country j at time t, so that there is a large sample of every country's exports to all of the others.

Radio, a long-standing method of communicating with farmers, has helped them to obtain better farm-gate prices by providing information on commodity prices. Internet stations with agricultural market information (e-Choupals) have done the same in Madhya Pradesh, India. Mobile phones have allowed fishermen and onshore buyers in Kerala, India, to communicate supply and price information, resulting in higher profits, lower consumer prices, and less waste. Among grain traders in Niger, the introduction of mobile phone coverage in two markets reduced the price variation between the two, ultimately increasing traders' profits, decreasing prices paid by consumers, and increasing total welfare. Cell phone coverage also reduced within-year price variation for producers.

Article 20 (Research, surveillance and exchange of information) and Article 21 (Reporting and exchange of information): There is an important but as yet unmet need for surveillance, research, and exchange of information on the accumulation of tobacco smoke in both the indoor and outdoor environment. It is particularly important from an international perspective, given the significant variation between countries and locations with different levels of tobacco consumption and tobacco policies. Differences observed in thirdhand smoke levels in Spain, China and the USA point to the potential impact of tobacco control policies on third-hand smoke to reduce smoking prevalence and de-normalize tobacco use. Scientific evidence suggests that cotinine and other tobacco smoke constituents should also be monitored to better understand their implications - how they enter, accumulate in and pollute water, become embedded in indoor environments, and affect human health long after the cigarettes have been smoked. Greater focus on this Article should also be leveraged to encourage more research, surveillance and exchange of information in low-and middleincome countries on the environmental impacts of tobacco agriculture.

This area is expressed in global hectares, hectares with world-average biological productivity. Footprint calculations use yield factors to take into account national differences in biological productivity (e.g., tonnes of wheat per UK hectare versus per Argentina hectare) and equivalence factors to take into account differences in world average productivity among land types (e.g., world average forest versus world average cropland).

This would require raising yields through greater use of fertilizer , seeds , and mechanized implements , shifting the crop mix to more valuable crops and increasing the amount of land under cultivation .	There is clear upside potential for five major sectors of the Nigerian economy:  Retail and wholesale trade. Based on an expanding consumer class in Nigeria, retail and wholesale spending could rise strongly over the next few decades. This could make this the largest sector of the economy in the longer term and provides a particularly good opportunity for producers of fast-moving consumer items such as juices, which could grow by more than 10% per year up to 2030.  Agriculture. The sector, which is now the largest at 22% of GDP, could more than double in size by 2030. This would require raising yields through greater use of fertilizer, seeds, and mechanized implements, shifting the crop mix to more valuable crops and increasing the amount of land under cultivation.  Infrastructure. On average, the value of a nation's core infrastructure--roads, railways, ports, airports, the electrical system--is about 70% of GDP; in Nigeria, core infrastructure is estimated to be only around 35% - 40% of GDP. Its road network lags well behind other emerging economies such as China and even India. On a per capita basis, Nigeria has one-third the residential buildings of Indonesia and one-sixth of the commercial space. Between core infrastructure and real estate, total infrastructure investments in Nigeria could be as high as US$1.5trillion between 2014 and 2030. 26 World Bank: Ease of Doing Business Report, 2014 Will the shiftin global economic power continue? PwC  30  manufacturing. Manufacturing in Nigeria remains at a relatively early stage of development, contributing only around 7% of GDP in 2013. It has, however, achieved strong growth recently, with output rising by 13% per year from 2010 to 2013. Based on current trends, this could yield a four-fold increase in manufacturing output by 2030.  Oil and gas. While the oil and gas sector is expected to grow relatively modestly compared to other sectors, and remains vulnerable to global price fluctuations as seen recently, its success is still important for the Nigerian economy. With the right reforms, liquids production could increase from 2.35m barrels a day on average now to over 3m barrels a day by 2030, while natural gas output could grow at around 6% per annum to 2030.

For rice , cotton , and cashew nuts , the productivity increase has started .	For rice, cotton, and cashew nuts, the productivity increase has started. The overall objectives of the 'Agriculture for Jobs Agenda' are to enhance agricultural labor productivity in existing crops, to diversify the agricultural output mix, and to add value. In recent years, a beginning has been made on each of these fronts. Among staple crops, progress has been especially noticeable for rice, with FAO statistics suggesting annual yield gains in the order of 20 percent (Figure3.4). In light of the much lower yield levels recorded in the micro data, such a growth rate seems somewhat large and deserves further scrutiny.56 Nonetheless, irrespective of the exact growth rate, progress in rice production since the 2008 world food price crisis is real and consistent with concerted government efforts to boost domestic rice production (see section 3.3). Yield growth was negative however among other staple crops (such as roots and tubers). It reflects the longstanding neglect of staple crops in favor of cash crops and presents an area of attention, also in light of the poverty rates among food crop growers. Among cash crops, yield growth has also been revived, especially in cotton and cashew, indicating diversification beyond cocoa, though the production of coffee and pineapples declined (not reported in Figure3.4).

They are self-governed by indigenous institutions within their territories and the protected areas contained therein , in application of arrangements established with system-level protected area authorities .	The main distinguishing features of indigenous peoples' protected areas have to do with the sociopolitical arrangements that are established between indigenous peoples and national authorities for the government of lands and resources in indigenous peoples' lands. Basically such features are that: 1. They are based upon the collective rights of the respective indigenous people, nation or community to lands, territories and resources, under national contexts; 2. They are established as protected areas in application of the right of self-determination, exercised mainly through: * Self-declaration of the protected area by the indigenous people or nation with collective territorial rights on the area; * Free, prior and informed consent of the people, nation or community with territorial rights on the area, in cases where the designation proposal is originated in government agencies, conservation organizations or other actors. 3. They are based on ancestral or traditional occupation; 4. Occupation, use and management are connected to and dependent upon the broader socio-cultural and political structure of a people or nation, which includes their customary law and institutions; 5.

Thai Aid could leverage Peanut-CRSP funding and future training on peanut could be funded through the TICP Program in the other collaborating countries. Peanut CRSP scientists and the Management Entity should support the Thai Project Team to pursue this opportunity. Kasetsart University-KAPI could access the Small-and Medium Enterprises Fund from the Ministry of Industry to support training activities. The objective is to train staff from private industry for 10-15 days on processing technologies and on good industry practices. The experience in partnering with private food companies using the Industry Incubator Model, developed in the Philippines in collaboration with Peanut CRSP, would be useful for the Thai trainers involved in this project. Training of South East Asian Scientists: An international training course on Peanut Processing and -Uutilization Technologies was held in September 2003. Participants included 13 scientists (6 women and 7 men) from 9 countries: Bulgaria (2), Cambodia (2), Indonesia (1), Lao PDR (1), Malaysia (1), Mayanmar (1), Philippines (2), Thailand (2), and Timor-Leste (1). Similar topics, as the Thai nationals training, were covered, including the use of Eliza kits to detect aflatoxin in peanut. The trainees visited villages where Peanut CRSP technology transfer activities were ongoing (Nakornrachasrima and Udorn Thanee Villages, Khon Kaen), and Suwan Research Farm where peanut experiments were conducted. Exposure to actual field/village situation facilitated the learning process and allowed the participants to meet with village processors and extension workers. Participants in the international training, held in 2003, paid their own travel cost and hotel accommodation.

"The result of such loss leads to social tensions, and sometimes violent conflict.

We will examine some of these examples more closely after page 39. Suggestions for further work: Have you understood the principle of overshoot? Imagine, for example, you take a second job in a bakery. You must get up every morning at 3 a.m. After a certain amount of time, your ability to perform your day job really begins to suffer, probably because you are much too tired. Is this overshoot? Consider other situations from your everyday life, your family, your community, or on a global level in which overshoot can occur (even when we don't call it that in everyday conversation)."

There are countries and territories where all nature is sacred and protected areas can form smaller entities as part of larger sacred landscapes .	Many protected areas contain sites of importance to one, and sometimes more than one faith or spiritual value systems, including both sacred natural sites and built monuments such as monasteries, temples, shrines and pilgrimage trails. Even in systems of protected areas in the most secularized countries of Europe, which were established using only ecological criteria, it is estimated that between 20-35 percent include significant cultural or spiritual values. There are countries and territories where all nature is sacred and protected areas can form smaller entities as part of larger sacred landscapes. Managers have to ensure that these spiritual values are protected alongside natural heritage. However, sacred sites are currently not effectively reflected in protected area designations and management plans, and existing policy and legal frameworks do not adequately support sacred (natural) sites. There is sound and widespread evidence that sacred natural sites have been providing effective biodiversity conservation, often for hundreds of years. Sacred sites may exist in more or less natural ecosystems, cultural landscapes or managed landscapes and when they occur in protected areas they need to be fully incorporated into management strategies in cooperation with the relevant faith and community groups.

Thus the project can move on to the next phase which is to gain further data on human safety , and to test efficacy of NS clay in naturally exposed people in Ghana .	The second study was undertaken to test humans for responses to exposure to NS clay without the exposure to aflatoxin. The information gained from this study, coupled with the chronic and sub-chronic toxicity studies in rats will serve as the basis for use of NS clay in long-term human intervention trials in populations at high risk for aflatoxicosis in Ghana. A randomized and double-blinded phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine the safety and tolerance of NS clay in humans and establish dosimetry protocols for long-term efficacy studies. Volunteers (20 - 45 yr in age), were clinically screened for confirmation of their health status. Fifty subjects (23 males and 27 females) were randomly divided into two groups: the low-dose group received six capsules containing 1.5 g/day, and the high-dose group Project TAM50 - 145 - received 6 capsules containing 3.0 g/day for a period of two weeks. NS clay capsules were distributed to each participant three times a day at designated sites. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after the study for laboratory analysis. Each participant completed the trial and compliance was 99.1%. All laboratory analyses, including hematology, minerals, vitamins A and E, and concentrations of selected electrolytes have been completed. Clinical and sub-clinical analyses, before and after NS clay exposure, have also been evaluated.

The association between food insecurity and gender is more prevalent in developing countries .	Using the FIES at the individual level can capture disparities in food security between women and men, including those due to intra-household differences in resource allocation and feeding priorities. Preliminary results from 117 countriesk show that women are more likely to be food insecure than men in 26 per cent of countries, and men in 12 per cent of countries. In the remaining countries, women are as likely as men to be food insecure. The association between food insecurity and gender is more prevalent in developing countries. The proportion of developing countries where women are more likely than men to be food insecure increases to 39 per cent, while for men, it remains at about the same level, at 13 per cent. However, at the completion of data collection exercises in the countries implementing the scale, further analysis is needed to confirm the validity of a global experience-based insecurity scale and ensure cross-country comparability of results, including from a gender perspective. a A first draft of this box was prepared by the FAO Statistics Division.

The use of ICT, such as apps to share the latest information, including to support clandestine border crossings, together with the consolidation of social media platforms to connect geographically dispersed groups with common interests, has raised valid questions concerning the extent to which technology has been used to support irregular migration, as well as to enable migrants to avoid abusive and exploitative migrant smugglers and human traffickers.25 Due to the ever-increasing access to emerging technology at low cost, migrants have also developed applications to support better integration in receiving countries, while maintaining social links and financial support to their families and societies back home, including through the increasing prevalence of ""mobile money"" apps."

Weeds are an almost universal companion of rice in the tropics. In many situations, weed growth is prolific and weeds are a major constraint to crop yield. Weeding is a major production cost, with estimates of 50-150 person-days per hectare required for manual weeding, depending on the number of weedings and type of rice culture. For many farmers, weeding requires the greatest labor input during the agricultural cycle, and labor is often not available when weeds are most damaging to the crop.

Important challenges remain, but Vietnam is The Republic of Korea effectively used policies to bring out the agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by 2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than 10 million people today, was a motor for the country's overall growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value added. Land development programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration of Korea's urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic. The country invested massively in skills to support its structural transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.

From Dublin to Shanghai, competitiveness initiatives increasingly involve cities, more than countries. This shift is a result of agglomeration effects: the level playing field evokes a flat world, whereas urbanization policies correspond to a world with spikes of economic activity. Dynamic cities may offer more favorable tax treatment, easy access to land, simplified administrative procedures, and sup- Industrial policy is an approach to state economic stewardship in which direct support is given to particular sectors in pursuit of national goals.

Similar analysis for 18 countries in Latin America using the 1990 Latinobarometro survey confirms these findings.

This is an emerging area for further research across disciplines. The effect of jobs on trust and civic engagement at the individual level suggests that exchanges The exclusionary nature of networks is highlighted by the experience of migrants moving from rural areas to cities. Migrants often choose destinations where they have connections. But if they do not, they can be uprooted from family and community ties that provide economic and social support, including access to jobs. They may also lack the information needed to integrate into their new destinations. Migrants moving across borders or regions, internally displaced persons or refugees fleeing from conflict or returning after a peace agreement, and soldiers demobilized after conflict may be particularly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportunities.

It is vital because exporters wish to be paid when goods are shipped while importers do not want to pay before they receive the merchandise. This can be a major problem in view of the fact that cargos from Europe to Asia may take up to 80 days. Financial institutions can help to bridge the gap between importers and exporters by providing payment solutions while taking the credit risk. Very little international trade is actually paid as cash in advance.

These categories can further be defined as either internal or external factors .	In order to seek input from a variety of participants in Eastern and Southern Africa, meetings were held in three different locations. The first meeting was held at SG Resort in Arusha, Tanzania on 27th and 28th March, 2014 in partnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Selian Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) in Tanzania. Twenty-four participants (10 females and 14 males) attended the Tanzania event. Each agenda reflects the availability and needs from the host country, and therefore have slight variations in regard to time and sequence. The Tanzania event was scheduled for two days. Each event covered similar topics as described above, and all three covered a SWOT analysis exercise. Participants were asked to brainstorm ideas and compile feedback on various aspects in regard to SI. For clarification purposes, a SWOT analysis is a strategy commonly used in strategic program planning. It provides a simple framework for an entity to scan both the internal and external environment. The SWOT analysis provides information that is helpful in matching the entity's resources and capabilities to the environment in which it operates. It also acts as a filter to reduce the information generated through the exercise to a manageable number of key issues. As the name implies, a SWOT analysis consists of four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. These categories can further be defined as either internal or external factors. Strengths and weaknesses are often internal to an entity. Opportunities and threats tend to be external factors, often beyond the control of the FtF Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab (SIIL) -1 - SWOT Analysis Report - Tanzania entity/organization, but that impact and/or influence operations. The following matrix presents the components of the SWOT analysis.	These categories can further be defined as either internal or external factors.

Sustainable community transmissions - - multiple chains of person-to-person transmissions in a community without direct link to travel - - have emerged in many countries , including the United States .	C virus (i.e., can spread between humans and other animal species) shares a high degree of genomic similarity to coronavirus in bats and to SARS-CoV in humans.4 Because this is a new viral challenge to humans, there is no preexisting immunity in humans and everyone is assumed to be a susceptible host to COVID-19.5 The most recent data show that COVID-19 is likely to be more contagious but less likely to cause severe clinical symptoms and deaths than SARS and MERS. A Chinese clinical study recorded 72,314 COVID-19 cases diagnosed by February 11, showing an overall CFR of 2.3 percent, with 81 percent of cases being mild. The CFR jumped to 8 percent among patients 70- 79 years old and to 14.8 percent among patients 80 years old and older.6 Most COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms, similar to a flu. People with mild symptoms might not go to the hospital or even necessarily know that they have the disease but could still carry the infection; accordingly, person-to-person transmission is not limited to hospital settings, which is what happened in the SARS and MERS cases. COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets and fomites (contact with contaminated surfaces). Data synthesis from several preliminary reports on COVID-19 indicates a coronavirus patient, on average, can transmit the disease to three people without intervention (compared with one for the common influenza, two for Ebola, and 18 for the measles).7 The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that such transmission in China occurred most often at the household level, as 78 percent to 85 percent of disease clusters were family clusters.8 The moderately high infectivity, mild clinical symptoms, uncertain incubation period, no human immunity, and possibility of asymptomatic healthy carriers may mean that the novel virus is likely to cause worldwide transmissions. At the time of this testimony, there have been COVID-19 case reports on every continent except Antarctica, while China still has the majority of the reported cases and deaths. Sustainable community transmissions--multiple chains of person-to-person transmissions in a community without direct link to travel--have emerged in many countries, including the United States.

Education Table C28 presents the types of nurses and educational requirements for entry into nursing programs in Eastern Europe. www.journalofnursingregulation.com 55Volume 10 * Special Issue * January 2020 Continuing Competence Most of the reporting jurisdictions require continuing education or training. Bulgaria and Greece do not have a requirement of continued competence for nurses. Russia has the most robust requirements for continued competence of the Eastern European jurisdictions. Every 5 years, all medical professionals are required to receive special training, which includes improvement of qualifications and reexamination. A certificate is issued following the examination. This certificate is the document that grants permission to continue practicing in a nursing role. This system is currently in the process of being reformed. The new procedure will require annual reexamination, as well as proof of continuing education. In addition, there are requirements regarding state of health such as regular health checks. For those who practice in pediatric care, applicants must have a lack of criminal record in specific areas. Bosnia and Herzegovina require annual seminars, courses, expert meetings in nursing and midwifery, and on-the-job training. Nurses in Estonia must have 60 hours of employer-provided training every year. The NRB in Lithuania requires at least 3 years of legal nursing practice during the past 5 years and 60 hours of mandatory advanced training during the past 5-year period or 160 hours of nursing advanced training on or after 5 years. Annual continuing professional development is mandatory in Romania. Serbian nurses must attain 168 points in order to satisfy continuing education credits--half of the total points must be derived from where the health professional is employed and the remaining half of the total points are attained via participation in external continuing education programs.

The Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) emerged out of a meeting of concerned organizations and individuals in 1996. It was designed to foster collaboration and action to address the ecological, economic, and social harm caused by invasive alien species. The first phase of GISP (1997-2000) focused on building a knowledge base on the issue of invasive alien species. This phase was driven by an international consortium of experts working as volunteers. Among the significant outputs were a global strategy on invasive alien species (McNeely ET Al., 2001) and invasive Alien Species: A toolkit of best prevention and management practices (Wittenberg & cock, 2001). The second phase of GISP (2000 - present) is designed to build upon the products of Phase I and foster greater international awareness of the problems caused by IAS. In Phase II, GISP will work with nations and regions on appropriate, cooperative measures for preventing, controlling, or eradicating IAS through six working groups, organized around the following topics: 1. National and regional facilitation and cooperation 2. Communication, education and outreach 3. Global information management 4. Pathway Management 5. Evaluation and assessment 6. Law and policy Phase II operates through an Executive Board, Advisory Panel of IAS experts, a formal Secretariat with paid staff (based in South Africa), and partnerships among countries and international organizations.

We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions , and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort .	"Suggestions for further work: What changes occur when biological diversity decreases? Part 2 Ecological accounting humans and wild living plants and animals will increase. The question will become: Who gets the fish - the sea lion or the human? Can declining population trends in species be reversed? If we wanted to put a full stop to human activities that lead to endangered and extinct species, we would need to make drastic changes in our living habits. It would likely require taking portions of land used by humans, and returning them to their natural state. It would also require changing our eating habits significantly. We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions, and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort. Biological diversity is not equally distributed throughout the world. Many biodiversity hotspots lie in Central America and western Amazonia, in the Cape area of South Africa, and in the mountains and plains of East Africa. Other regions rich in biodiversity include the coastal regions and islands of the Mediterranean, Southwest China, and the bordering areas from Burma to Vietnam. Large parts of Madagascar also belong to this list, as do numerous islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. When faced with the extinction of valuable biodiversity, is it sufficient to view the Earth exclusively as potentially productive area for humans? Or is our planet more than a source of raw materials for human consumption and a carbon dioxide sink for human waste? To enable sustainable development, scientists, politicians and members of civil society will have to take action, individually and collectively, to protect the Earth's diversity of ecosystems, genes and species, while maintaining a high quality of life for humans. Suggestion for further work: a mental game Imagine that people and biodiversity are ""playing chess"". Both want ""the fish"", the ever decreasing natural resources."	We would need to protect the most ecologically valuable regions, and we might need to prioritize ecosystem health over our own comfort.

China prohibits the importation of remanufactured products, which it typically classifies as used goods. China also maintains restrictions that prevent remanufacturing process inputs (known as cores) from being imported into China's customs territory, except special economic zones. These import prohibitions and restrictions undermine the development of industries in many sectors in China, including mining, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, and communications, because companies in these industries are unable to purchase high-quality, lower-cost remanufactured products produced outside of China.

Country Notes Basic education (Enseignement fondamental) lasts for nine years and leads to the Brevet d'enseignement fondamental. Secondary education is compulsory and consists of a three-year cycle of study provided in secondary schools and technicums. There are two branches of secondary education: general and specialized and technical/vocational. Students in general secondary and specialized secondary education study for three years. Successful students are awarded the Baccalaureat de l'Enseignement secondaire in one of the various streams offered. The Baccalaureat gives access to higher education but some institutions require it to be of a certain type (science, arts, etc.). The objective of technical and vocational secondary education is to prepare students for active life and industry (technicians and qualified workers). Studies last between one and four years, according to the type of training undertaken and can also lead to the Baccalaureat technique and higher education.

Participation in primary education has been negatively affected by the crisis between 2002 and 2011 and Coted'Ivoire has not yet fully caught up with other countries in the region.106 Before 2002 Coted'Ivoire was almost on par with average primary education enrollment rates for developing countries in Sub-Saharan African. However, the gross enrollment rate (GER), which measures total enrollment relative to the primary age population, has deteriorated from 2002. In 2002 gross enrollment was 77 percent and it decreased to as low as 70 percent in 2007. While there was some catch-up in enrollment during the years of peace between 2008 and 2010, where the rate stepped back up to around 73 percent, the most significant improvement came after 2011 when the rate increased to 90 percent by 2014. In 2015, the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to 16. This should help close the gap in enrollment rates with respect to Sub-Saharan Africa, where the GER in primary education was 99.6 percent in 2013. In fact, some patterns in inequality in access to education are more pronounced in Coted'Ivoire than other Sub-Saharan African developing countries, and addressing access and enrollment in basic education remains an important policy consideration to ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school.

This chapter discusses policy entry points to maximize agriculture's contribution. It begins with a brief profile of smallholder agriculture in Coted'Ivoire and the opportunities and challenges it presents for inclusive employment within agriculture, and also further down the chain. The focus is on features of the agricultural system that are important from a jobs perspective and agricultural subsectors that are particularly promising for inclusive employment, but that have so far received less attention in national employment strategies. This is not to dismiss the important potential of export crops, but these have been discussed extensively elsewhere (WorldBank 2012; 2015). Furthermore, many of the challenges faced by these crops, are also akin to those faced in the rice chains, which are discussed in more detail.53 The chapter concludes with five policy entry points.

Gender plays a significant role in school progression and completion in most countries .	Poverty and other barriers further reinforce gender disparities in learning opportunities The reasons why children do not attend school vary, but they are often associated with poverty, ethnicity, social exclusion, living in a rural area or slum, geographic remoteness, disasters, armed conflict, lack of basic facilities and poor-quality education. These barriers often interact with gender to create even greater disadvantages in learning opportunities. Countries face different challenges and need different policies depending on their circumstances. Among interventions that have successfully been used to reach the disadvantaged and the marginalized, especially girls include: the abolishment of school fees; increased education budgets; social cash transfers, especially to support poor families, making it easier for them to send their children to school; increasing attention to ethnic and linguistic minorities; overcoming conflicts that keep children out of school because of hostilities; and improving the quality of education.15 School progression at the primary level In order to achieve universal completion of primary education, it is important that all boys and girls of primary school age attend school and progress through primary education. High levels of repetition and drop out hinder a considerable number of children from transitioning to secondary education. Difficulty in progressing through the primary grades (repeating) or leaving school before completing the last grade of primary education (dropping out) occur for a variety of reasons, mostly related to the educational system and social and economic factors. Gender plays a significant role in school progression and completion in most countries. 15 UNESCO, 2014a.	Gender plays a significant role in school progression and completion in most countries.

In the national employment survey , it first appears that schooling is correlated with household enterprises ' productivity .	Formal education has mixed effects on productivity in household enterprises. In the national employment survey, it first appears that schooling is correlated with household enterprises' productivity. However, this effect works through a range of other factors, including the number of years in operation and hours worked a week, so that there is no remaining education premia after controlling for these factors (Table C.3, AnnexC). Earlier cross-country analysis also suggested limited returns to education in the sector (see Fox and Sohnesen 2012), although the majority of household enterprise owners have no formal education. Chapter6 in this report also shows that earnings premia for additional education are lower in nonagricultural self-employment than they are in wage employment. Still, qualitative informants acknowledge that basic education can contribute to run microenterprises through basic numeracy and literacy skills.82 Years of experience in operation are associated with higher productivity. One of the key differences between formal and informal enterprises is that formal enterprises have the ability to acquire skilled workforce or upgrade workforce whenever necessary, while microenterprises have limited scope for human capital changes. As indicated above, household enterprises' owners work alone most of the time and have limited formal education. Qualitative informants indicate during FGDs that they often compensate the lack of these skills with experience over time ('learning by doing')83 (Figure4.17). Estimates from the national employment survey also indicate that there is a positive and statistically significant nonlinear effect of age on household enterprises productivity (Figure4.18). The coefficient estimates range from 9.9 percent to 11.1 percent (Table C.3, columns 1 and 2).

The long-term consequences and costs of decoupling can be higher than is usually thought. During periods of massive structural change, the reallocation of workers out of declining industries can lead to large output losses because little alternative employment is available. The productivity of jobs in declining industries may be low, but it can still be higher than the alternatives. Similarly, during crises, firms might not be insolvent but rather illiquid. Death of inherently solvent firms could cause loss of firm-specific human capital and intangible assets, disruption of value chains, and damage to surrounding communities. While the provision of credit would be the preferred solution, identifying insolvent firms might not always be feasible and could be marred by transparency problems. Temporary job protection policies can be a workable alternative to provide a lifeline for struggling, but inherently solvent, firms.

The 2000 floods in Mozambique demonstrated clearly that it is easier to make an impact and carry out extensive recovery period activities when the disaster is high profile and the amount of money donated to the affected populations is large. In lower profile emergencies all the donated money is usually absorbed during the expensive relief period, leaving little room for maneuver in the recovery period. This was not the case in Mozambique where resources were pledged and have continued to arrive over the two year period post-floods. One of the main factors contributing to poverty in Mozambique has been identified as isolation 15 leading to lack of social infrastructure and restricted economic opportunities. The improvement in the infrastructures after the floods has led to real changes in household livelihood security. Although asset loss was a serious blow for households the improvement in the houses of people displaced through the floods has had a lasting positive psychological effect on the beneficiaries. Without fail, people were appreciative of the improved living conditions. True participation of affected populations continues to be a goal worth chasing but not yet reached. In the recovery period there is more time to allow for consultation. Consultation improved the nature of the interventions in this period, but participation leading to empowerment was rare, mainly due to the lack of transparency and equity between negotiating bodies.

These contextual factors undermine resilience in myriad ways often reinforcing low-return rice cropping that precludes wealth generation , necessitates coping , and does not provide farmers with resources to respond adequately to climate shocks .	Although the coping strategies undertaken by rice farmers partly contribute to the persistence of vulnerability, e.g., through depletion of assets, increases in, or maintenance of, debt, they do not fully explain why vulnerability occurs or persists. These coping strategies can be seen as symptoms of the absence of resilience; ultimately a range of contextual factors interact to maintain this low-productivity, low-resilience state of rice farming. These contextual factors undermine resilience in myriad ways often reinforcing low-return rice cropping that precludes wealth generation, necessitates coping, and does not provide farmers with resources to respond adequately to climate shocks. For example, the institutions governing land access mean many households operate small plots that do not generate sufficient returns because there is no surplus to sell. Thus small and insecure land holdings act as a break on income accrual and asset accumulation that can be used to smooth the impact of crop losses following climate hazards.

Other high-potential sectors include business activities ( ISIC 74 ) and transport services ( ISIC 63 ) , due to their high contribution to aggregate employment and a high labor intensity .	Incentives and support programs might benefit from taking into account sectoral potential for job creation. One measure that could help guide targeting is to consider the labor intensity in different sectors, particularly for unskilled labor. Table D.4 shows a breakdown along this line, where labor intensity is measured as the expenditure share of employment in value added output, which could be considered as the derived labor demand. Food manufacturing (ISIC 15), for example, is important for employment but as a relatively capital-intensive sector, its employment returns to the same amount of investments will be fairly limited. Other high-potential sectors include business activities (ISIC 74) and transport services (ISIC 63), due to their high contribution to aggregate employment and a high labor intensity. In addition, these are also network industries whose growth can have potential to improve services inputs to the rest of the economy. An alternative to ex ante targeting, given the difficulty to predict business success, is to identify emerging successful firms or sectors and consider policies to alleviate the constraints specific to those firms/sectors.

One of the major reasons is the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices .	While the intensification of crop-based agriculture has been associated with a significant increase in the use of inorganic fertilizer, the application of fertilizer per hectare is far lower in Sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region of the world. One of the major reasons is the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices. Fertilizer prices are usually two to three times higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and Latin America because of poor infrastructure and trade logistics.13 Another major constraint on fertilizer application is the lack of credit for smallholders, given that land ownership titles are seldom secured and hence cannot be used as collateral.14 Therefore, productivity growth in agriculture also requires a favorable investment climate including improved access to infrastructure and credit.15 troducing new varieties and so tend not to make the effort.

Winners and losers The obvious winners of globalization are the workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which industries and splintered tasks have migrated.

The development of more efficient industries and services encourage a reallocation of labor toward more productive uses. It also stimulates the subsequent development of other interrelated industries and sectors through backward and forward linkages. The development of a modern services sector can lead to greater coordination in value chains and make a further subdivision of tasks and the reorganization of production possible, leading to economies of scale.55 Multiple actors--including multinationals, civil society organizations and consumers in industrial countries--are increasingly active in efforts to improve working conditions and workers' rights in developing countries.

Consignment Consignment in international trade is a variation of the open-account method of payment in which payment is sent to the exporter only after the goods have been sold by the foreign distributor to the end customer. An international consignment transaction is based on a contractual arrangement in which the foreign distributor receives, manages, and sells the goods for the exporter, who retains title to the goods until they are sold. Payment to the exporter is required only for those items sold.

Sustainability does n't simply mean robust ecosystems , it ensures a long-term revenue stream for pioneer investors , those with the foresight to plan and make changes now to prepare for future resource constraints .	In a new era of resource constraints, new tools are needed for securing economic success and resilience. The good news is that with Ecological Footprint accounting, we now can track something we did not see before--the extent to which we are overdrawing our ecological accounts, and how far we are away from rebalancing this budget. This information provides a hopeful perspective, suggesting that even working with what we have now, it is well within our ability to secure long-term well-being for all of society. In addition, future-proofing our economies and refocusing our investment efforts can have tremendous payback. Sustainability doesn't simply mean robust ecosystems, it ensures a long-term revenue stream for pioneer investors, those with the foresight to plan and make changes now to prepare for future resource constraints. In fact, if we reverse population trends, improve resource efficiency measures, sufficiently reduce consumption and better manage our ecological assets to increase yields, then demand will no longer exceed supply. If we end overshoot, resource constraints by definition disappear.

More than one quarter of the world's conflicts occur in Asia and the Pacific,48 and in recent years violence has intensified. The region now hosts 3.3 million refugees. In 2019, the impact on civilians of the conflict in Afghanistan worsened, partly due to a series of deadly attacks on civilian targets, the escalation of air strikes and election violence. July 2019 was the single bloodiest month for civilians since records began in 2009. Neighbouring Pakistan hosts about 1.3 million Afghan refugees, while itself experiencing drought and insecurity from non-State armed groups.

Firm dynamics provide some evidence of the difficulties associated with job creation and employment growth in these countries. Rates of new firm registration are low in most countries in the region.83 And even when they do get started, small firms face barriers in growing into sizable companies. The vast majority of Tunisian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them are one-person entities, and only 0.4 percent have 100 workers or more. But these large firms account for more than one-third of all jobs, more than all the one-person firms combined. A study of their dynamics over a decade shows that micro-and small firms hardly ever become large firms. Moreover, one-person firms only very rarely graduate into the small size category, and many are likely to shut down.84 While countries with high youth unemployment may face a large youth bulge or education quality issues, problems are often on the demand side, with limited competition reducing employment opportunities, especially for highly skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa would have greater scope to generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased. This prospect is unlikely to materialize, however, as long as political connections remain more important than entrepreneurial capacity to enter they would make a major dent in the aggregate unemployment rate is unclear. Better matches between jobseekers and employment opportunities would result in large increases in total employment only if there were many unfilled vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle East and North Africa. Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and by increasing privatization and deregulation.79 Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for the most part.80 The problem is similar with training programs. Educated youth have the capacity to learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could even provide on-the-job training as needed. But training may not change aspirations.

Consequently, there is a need to improve competitiveness to keep arrivals coming to maximize the subregion's T&T potential. Within this context, the Balkans and Eastern Europe had one of the fastest rates of improvement in T&T competitiveness of all the subregions. Countries narrowed their gap with other subregions in areas related to natural and cultural tourism, building their case as a travel destination. Enhanced T&T prioritization, tourist service infrastructure and price competitiveness (the subregion's strongest relative advantage to the rest of Europe) have reinforced this case; Balkan and Eastern European countries are diverting more resource to the industry, making travel more convenient and less expensive. In part thanks to these trends, subregional arrivals picked up--as more airlines are now offering flights--thereby expanding route capacity. It's no surprise, then, that the subregion had the strongest growth on air transport infrastructure in Europe. However, the subregion still underperforms the global average on six pillars and the European average on all but price competitiveness, indicating a need for continued improvements. In particular, subregional Explore additional features of the report at http://reports.weforum.org/ttcr 39 The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019 players need to speed up their improvements on aspects related to enabling environment and ground infrastructure.

Lack of disaggregated data and research also impede the development of effective policies and programmes to promote inclusive education.

The approach has been applied in many educational disciplines, such as nursing, literacy learning, computer science, engineering, teacher education and business (Desplaces et al., 2009). It shares theoretical roots with entrepreneurial education in that both approaches have been stated to branch out from the educational philosophy of John Dewey (Giles and Eyler, 1994, Pepin, 2012). Still, very little research has been done on the interaction between them (For some exceptions, see Desplaces et al., 2009, McCrea, 2009, Litzky et al., 2009). Teachers interested in working with entrepreneurial education could probably learn much from service-learning initiatives, such as components of successful service-learning programs (Kenworthy-U'Ren et al., 2006) and factors that motivate and deter use of a service-learning approach in educational institutions (Abes et al., 2002).

It may also point to limited off-farm income opportunities in the rural areas to diversify, such that sorting is more dichotomous --either fully in agriculture; or fully outside agriculture, but further away, in the city where nonagricultural self-employment and wage jobs are concentrated (see subsequent chapters).

In contrast , countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being , particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence .	"If current trends continue, things will definitely not get easier. We are entering a period beyond oil scarcity: most resources humanity depends on might get tighter, including food and water. Resource distribution and good stewardship of natural assets will become a central challenge of the 21st Century. Countries and cities that prepare themselves for resource scarcity will be the winners. In contrast, countries and regions that possess scant natural resources and lack the economic resources will eventually face serious threats to their well-being, particularly if they have not curbed their resource dependence. Footprint analyses open new horizons and approaches to problem-solving. Against this backdrop the tool is, above all, useful for development cooperation. The Footprint is exceptionally effective in building an understanding of the relevance of ecological limits, as well as instrumental for educational work. For example, when students compare the average per capita Footprint of someone living in Germany or the USA to that of someone living in Mali or India, there will be inevitable questions and in-depth discussions. For many, the complex interactions emerging from globalization are made comprehensible for the first time via the Footprint. Footprint accounting is about charting a course for governments, corporations, cities and individuals. It is about priorities and, ultimately, about questions of how to live well. Following the guideline of ""living well within the means of one planet"", the Footprint does not divide the world into good and evil, and does not moralize. Instead, it simply informs us about who is consuming how much of the planet's ecological services, and how much is available where. This view of the world has proven to be sufficient for raising central questions and sparking the conversations that are needed to reverse current trends.

Food security means access by all people at all times to adequate food required to live an active, healthy life. Its essential elements are both availability of food and the ability of the people to acquire it. National self-sufficiency in food may not ensure food security because the poor may not have enough income to buy adequate food. India, for example, is self-sufficient in rice because it does not need to import it. Yet, onethird of the Indian population cannot afford to buy basic food.

Every 5 years, all medical professionals are required to receive special training, which includes improvement of qualifications and reexamination. A certificate is issued following the examination. This certificate is the document that grants permission to continue practicing in a nursing role. This system is currently in the process of being reformed.

The MoH also released guidelines for health workers on how to continue providing quality preventive and clinical services in light of the COVID-19 pandemic ( MoH Kenya , 2020c ) .	In Kenya, usage rates for essential routine medical services have been severely affected, even at this comparatively early stage of the outbreak. For example, in March 2020 immunisation, family planning, and HIV prevention and treatment services were down to 30 to 35% of their normal levels, while in-hospital delivery rates are reportedly down by over 50% (Global Citizen, 2020). Perceived reasons for reduced use of health facility services include community fear of facility-acquired infection, curfew and movement restrictions, and fear of police harassment. The supply of routine services has been limited by concern among health workers providing non-COVID-19 services about lack of protection, given that PPE is being prioritised for COVID-19 activities. Strategic decisions and prioritisation have also limited supply, including efforts to decongest facilities by seeing patients by appointment only, or solely for critical cases, suspension of all elective procedures by the MoH, and reallocation of healthcare staff from essential routine care to COVID-19.

In Brazil , nurses and advanced or specialized nurses possess authority to offer a nursing diagnosis .	Practice Although there is limited availability of data within the nursing profession across South America, authorized practice seems to vary depending on nurse type. In Argentina, nurses and licensed nurses both have prescriptive authority and may prescribe any medications. However, neither may refer patients for additional care, nor may they diagnose patients. In Peru, a nurse has a duty to administer healthcare in an emergent situation and, because of this, nurse specialists and general nurses may prescribe medication or refer patients for additional medical care. Both nurse types may diagnose patients. Ancestral midwives in Ecuador may refer patients for additional medical care, diagnose patients, and prescribe medicinal plants and natural remedies. In Brazil, nurses and advanced or specialized nurses possess authority to offer a nursing diagnosis. In addition, these types of nurses may prescribe medications according to protocols, clinical and therapeutic guidelines, or other technical regulations established by the federal, state, or municipal authorities. These protocols and guidelines are subject to the legal provisions of the profession. Prescriptive authority granted to nurses and advanced or specialized nurses is regarding medications previously established in each respective public health program and those routinely approved by each health institution. Nurses and advanced or specialized nurses, however, do not have the autonomy to request examinations and prescribe medications in isolated private practices. These types of nurses must be working within a health team in order to prescribe, diagnose, or refer and request examinations.

The supply of routine services has been limited by concern among health workers providing non-COVID-19 services about lack of protection , given that PPE is being prioritised for COVID-19 activities .	In Kenya, usage rates for essential routine medical services have been severely affected, even at this comparatively early stage of the outbreak. For example, in March 2020 immunisation, family planning, and HIV prevention and treatment services were down to 30 to 35% of their normal levels, while in-hospital delivery rates are reportedly down by over 50% (Global Citizen, 2020). Perceived reasons for reduced use of health facility services include community fear of facility-acquired infection, curfew and movement restrictions, and fear of police harassment. The supply of routine services has been limited by concern among health workers providing non-COVID-19 services about lack of protection, given that PPE is being prioritised for COVID-19 activities. Strategic decisions and prioritisation have also limited supply, including efforts to decongest facilities by seeing patients by appointment only, or solely for critical cases, suspension of all elective procedures by the MoH, and reallocation of healthcare staff from essential routine care to COVID-19. The MoH also released guidelines for health workers on how to continue providing quality preventive and clinical services in light of the COVID-19 pandemic (MoH Kenya, 2020c).

Urban consumption surveys in Burkina Faso, for example, have found that the poorest third of urban households obtains 33% of its cereal-based calories from rice.

The academic publishing system is largely focused on producing journal articles and books .	"It is important to highlight at the outset that there are fundamental differences in the publishing processes for academic and non-academic material, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The academic publishing system is largely focused on producing journal articles and books. This process typically involves multi-stage reviews and editorial comments involving authors, editors and reviewers. Most published academic research (""white"" literature) is behind paywalls (that is, not freely accessible), and often managed by commercial publishers. In contrast, the production of research and analysis publications outside of academic publishing (""grey"" literature) generally involves faster and simpler processes that are typically, although not always, characterized by more limited peer review. Contributions from grey literature (such as research reports, working papers and government/official documents) are usually freely available. A report such as this, designed to contribute to our collective understanding of migration and mobility in an increasingly interconnected world, would clearly be incomplete without describing the role of grey literature, which has been ""recognized as a key source of evidence, argument, innovation, and understanding"".6 The volume, diversity and growth of both white and grey literature preclude a systematic review of all the material produced and published on migration in 2017 and 2018. Instead, this chapter highlights examples of key contributions made during this period, published in English by a selection of academic journals and intergovernmental organizations. It provides an update to the chapter in World Migration Report 2018, including by focusing on different academic journals and intergovernmental organizations, and their key output in 2017 and 2018.7 The next section provides an overview of the different actors involved in migration research and analysis. The third section features recent, selected contributions from academia and intergovernmental organizations, and the reach and impact of some of the migration research materials published."

Each approach (fostering intrasectoral productivity growth versus intersectoral labor shifts) entails somewhat different policy interventions. Those focused on fostering intrasectoral productivity growth aim to get the macro-fundamentals and business environment right, which benefits all sectors, possibly complemented with targeted sectoral initiatives to increase labor productivity within sectors (for example, through technological development and capital accumulation). By affecting the difference in labor productivity between sectors, the latter also affect incentives for intersectoral labor movements. But intersectoral labor mobility can also be encouraged more directly, through the removal of barriers to cross-sectoral movements.

In contrast, in subSaharan Africa and Southern Asia, where the goal of universal primary education has not yet been achieved, the proportions of women and men without schooling or whose highest educational attainment is the primary level are significant, but modest for those whose highest educational attainment is at the secondary or tertiary level."

CHAPTER 9 A prerequisite for improved living standards is a policy environment conducive to private-sector-led job creation. Macro - economic stability, an enabling business environment, human capital, and the rule of law are all necessary ingredients. Adequate macroeconomic policies mitigate aggregate fluctuations and keep key relative prices aligned. The business environment provides the basic public goods needed for the private sector to operate: infrastructure, access to finance, and sound regulation. Human capital is formed through good nutrition, health, and education that builds human skills. The rule of law ensures the enforcement of contracts; it also includes the progressive realization of rights to avoid a situation where growth coexists with unacceptable forms of work. These are the fundamentals on which policies for jobs rest (figure 9.1).

In economies with a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 , Doing Business covers business regulation in both the largest and second largest business city .	Another assumption underlying the Doing Business indicators is that entrepreneurs have knowledge of and comply with applicable regulations. In practice, entrepreneurs may not be aware of what needs to be done or how to comply with regulations and may lose considerable time trying to find out. Alternatively, they may intentionally avoid compliance--by not registering for social security, for example. Firms may opt for bribery and other informal arrangements intended to bypass the rules where regulation is particularly onerous--an aspect that helps explain differences between the de jure data provided by Doing Business and the de facto insights offered by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys.6 Levels of informality tend to be higher in economies with particularly burdensome regulation. Compared with their formal sector counterparts, firms in the informal sector typically grow more slowly, have poorer access to credit and employ fewer workers--and these workers remain outside the protections of labor law and, more generally, other legal protections embedded in the law.7 Firms in the informal sector are also less likely to pay taxes. Doing Business measures one set of factors that help explain the occurrence of informality and provides policy makers with insights into potential areas of regulatory reform. a.

In order to seek input from a variety of participants in Eastern and Southern Africa, meetings were held in three different locations. The first meeting was held at SG Resort in Arusha, Tanzania on 27th and 28th March, 2014 in partnership with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and Selian Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) in Tanzania. Twenty-four participants (10 females and 14 males) attended the Tanzania event. Each agenda reflects the availability and needs from the host country, and therefore have slight variations in regard to time and sequence. The Tanzania event was scheduled for two days. Each event covered similar topics as described above, and all three covered a SWOT analysis exercise. Participants were asked to brainstorm ideas and compile feedback on various aspects in regard to SI. For clarification purposes, a SWOT analysis is a strategy commonly used in strategic program planning. It provides a simple framework for an entity to scan both the internal and external environment. The SWOT analysis provides information that is helpful in matching the entity's resources and capabilities to the environment in which it operates. It also acts as a filter to reduce the information generated through the exercise to a manageable number of key issues. As the name implies, a SWOT analysis consists of four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. These categories can further be defined as either internal or external factors. Strengths and weaknesses are often internal to an entity. Opportunities and threats tend to be external factors, often beyond the control of the FtF Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab (SIIL) -1 - SWOT Analysis Report - Tanzania entity/organization, but that impact and/or influence operations.

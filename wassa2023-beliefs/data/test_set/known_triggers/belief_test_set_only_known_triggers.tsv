They require reduced barriers to entry and means of managing risk that are not dependent on the direct involvement of government institutions. Farmers also require more differentiated levels of assistance that can incentivize less risk-averse producers to become more commercially oriented. Such upgrading might include the following: Enhanced government view of and clear role for the private sector in GoS rice strategies Reformed land concession procedures with clear criteria for granting land to new and existing producers willing to invest in land preparation and irrigation infrastructure Greater confidence in market mechanisms, such as MOUs and contracts, to manage risk and resolve conflicts Support services that are more transparent and widely available, especially for basic inputs, extension services, finance and equipment leasing Domestic rice is relatively unknown as a consumer product in Senegal's dominant urban markets, which are accustomed to buying imported rice. Preliminary research conducted by WARDA suggests that urban consumers appreciate the taste, freshness and swelling capacity of domestic rice. However, appearance, packaging and cleanliness are important characteristics that influence buying decisions. These findings are consistent with pilot efforts undertaken by PINORD to develop a brand for high-quality local rice. Branding strategies emphasizing the unique selling points of domestic rice and incorporating appropriate and attractive packaging are fundamental for penetrating urban markets.

The other varieties are still available locally, preserved by some families and sold in the bush markets; they are still present, too, in culinary memories. The women were able to accurately describe the characteristics of the grain and flour, the related agricultural practices (e.g. crop cycle, seasonality), the interests and disadvantages of cultivating the variety, and the management of seeds. This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women. All these varieties were local or peasant. A summarized description of the 8 most cited recession sorghum varieties and photographs can be found in Tables S1 and Fig. S3 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material. Briefly, the 3 most frequently cited varieties were Poordi (which means brown, the color of the seed), Mariam Sowdou (from the name of the woman who introduced and spread it) and Balieri (which means white). Yellow variety (Paaca) was also mentioned. The choice of cultivating one or another variety was guided by the length of the crop cycle (e.g. the Poordi cycle was 20 days shorter than the Balieri cycle) and bird attacks (e.g. the Balieri was less sensitive compared to Poordi). As a result, the Poordi variety was the most cultivated while its bitter taste (a protective factor against bird attacks) was less and less appreciated by the families. Among the 19 other varieties mentioned, the cultivation of most of them has been abandoned due to longer cycles (e.g. Bobo Jamm and Samba Souke). In addition, the decrease in flooding for several consecutive years has had consequences for the seed conservation of these different varieties. Because the maximum storage time is two years according to women involved in sorghum breeding, and because of the uncertainty of the next floods, women progressively stopped keeping seeds and preferred to buy them at the market or from neighbors. Nevertheless, some women did their best to save sorghum seeds.	Expanding and intensifying rice production consequences on agrobiodiversity management and diet quality.

These data support McDonald et al. (2006) who showed SRI yields to be commensurate with ``Best Management Practices'', though in the present study, each far out yielded FP. But while farmers appreciated the potential for high yields and water savings with ASRI, they described labor demands for multiple mechanical weedings as onerous. Weedings also fell at a time labor was already constrained by horticultural crop requirements. Similarly, farmers described the elevated herbicide dose used in RMPs as potentially costly, and indicated that because of poorly functioning agrochemical markets, larger volumes of herbicides might be difficult to reliably source. Farmers consequently proposed testing FASRI as a fourth treatment that borrowed from both ASRI and RMP. FASRI included transplanting two 11-14 day old seedlings hill-1 at 20 x 20 cm, intermittent irrigation and recommended fertilizer rates. Weeds were mechanically controlled once with a cono weeder around 18 DAT. Herbicides (6:1 Propanil to 2,4-D ratio) were applied 12-18 days later, but only at locations in the field were weed presence warranted action.

By using labor quantification exercises, farmers in the current study identified similar labor bottlenecks with horticultural crop activities, especially for mechanical weeding requirements in SRI (Fig. 4). However, while farmers appreciated weed control in RMP, they also noted that higher herbicide rates could be prohibitively costly. Farmers also indicated that rates greater than used in FP were not viable because of poorly functioning credit institutions and agrochemical supply chains that prohibit the timely and consistent supply of larger volumes of herbicides. The 2008 dry season trials also took place during a period of increasing fuel and electricity costs that mirrored a global spike in energy prices. Farmers at Guia-4 and Oumar Youness experienced rising diesel costs for irrigation towards the season's end. At Nianga, pump-station administrators mandated a 21% increase in water fees. These events stimulated farmers' interest in watersaving techniques, provided that weeds could be managed effectively without increasing costs.

In this regard, Berkes and Folke (1998), Folke et al (2003) and Holling (2001) described coupled social-ecological systems as co-evolved, with mutually dependent and interacting social and ecological components. Understanding these interactions in our study was key to deciphering the status and positions of actors and investigating their embedded knowledge. For example, the 'DIVA Fest,' which was a festive event held to present the results, was one of several opportunities to interact with the community. All the participants (75 people, including most of the women who were interviewed in the study) continued to provide information enriching our own survey. During this event, women further described and discussed their attempts to experiment with a new cultural association of sorghum and cowpea under irrigation. They also took advantage of the event to report the death of seedling plants due to warmer and polluted water. The women farmers also appreciated the synthesis of the researchers' results: they felt that they were understood (the study correctly reflected their point of view), that their knowledge was valued and that their difficulties were publicly expressed in a symbolic place like the town hall.

Demand for rice is clearly not an issue, given that there is huge potential for import substitution in the rice market in Senegal and the GOS is committed to controlling imports and prices, as necessary, to ensure the profitability of domestic production. Therefore the question is what is the potential on the supply side? Supply is largely constrained by how much irrigated land there is (i.e., irrigation infrastructure). Currently around 60,000 ha have access to irrigation for growing rice. It is difficult to get a precise estimate of how much additional land already has irrigation infrastructure in place that needs to be rehabilitated, and how much new land could be utilized. According to interviews, SAED personnel believe that up to an additional 60,000 ha could be rehabilitated. According to an interview with the head of the PNAR and other sources,40 the total potential in the SRV is 240,000 ha.

Lease financing by Locafrique was available for combines, tractors, graders, and factory equipment. This was a major innovation as Locafrique was willing to make loans with the machinery itself as collateral. In interviews, Locafrique management said that they found that because of substantial excess demand for machinery services, most loans were relatively risk-free; they were successfully able to make such loans based on business plans and the character of the borrower. Locafrique has steadily expanded the size of its business. According to PCE, by 2014 it was supporting CFAF 1.6 billion (or around $3.4 million) in leasing credit, with additional applications currently in process of CFAF 3 billion ($6 million).

First of all, as documented earlier, urban consumers prefer broken rice, sorted into categories of homogenous size and they value the cleanness and visual presentation of rice (Fall et al., 2007; Demont et al., forthcoming). In contrast, most of the local paddy rice is only transformed into milled rice at a small informal mill, but not cleaned and sorted (which rural women usually do at home) and it involves mainly intermediary and whole grain rice. Although studies show that urban consumers are willing to pay a higher price for good quality local rice, consumers in Dakar generally believe that local rice is of inferior quality (Fall et al., 2007). There clearly is a mismatch between the product demanded by the majority of Senegalese consumers and the product characteristics of domestic rice that is supplied to them.

For instance, there is no public equivalent of the afore-mentioned government-run agency set up in the region that is tasked with providing technical assistance to farmers and serves as a public investment arm in various infrastructures (dams, storage facilities, etc.). This public involvement, coupled with the unique irrigation potentials and arable land endowments of the region, is also synonymous with relatively great returns to private investment as well as the financial sector, as opposed to the rest of the country. The extent to which this attractive profile of the region is actually translated into greater financial inclusion has yet to be fully investigated.

Djibi Seye, farmer and straight-talking village elder from nearby Diadiam 3 There can be uneasiness between smallholder farmers and larger agricultural companies, but it is not evident in this case. ``My village had the choice of whether or not to work with CASL,'' Seye explains. ``They presented themselves properly to us. We can see the beneTts for ourselves, and for them. It is entirely voluntary for Diadiam 3 to work with CASL. In other projects of this kind, it is not always the case, but this company brings jobs, hope and reassurance to local people. If this was not the case, believe me I would be telling you.'' If the area was depressed before, there was good reason for it. Diadiam 3 has a legacy and Tnds a sense of purpose in food. ``This used to be a Tshing village,'' Seye continues. ``Stocks have been badly affected by invasive plant species.''

The former is an Entisol, a tropical soil with high iron content and low organic matter. The second is an Alfisol, which is more weathered and has higher clay, silt, and organic matter content. Local farming systems include a mix of compound and bush fields cultivated by rural households. Compound fields surround homesteads, are cultivated permanently, receive various amounts of amendments from rubbish heaps or livestock pens, and are typically planted with cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees. Bush fields are located at some distance from homesteads (ranging from 0.5 km to a few kilometers), and may be differentiated into upland or lowland fields, suitable to a variety of crops, such as millet, maize, groundnut or maize. They receive less input than the compound fields. In both communities, the main crops are millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Farmers in Bacfassagal also produce sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which are often intercropped with millet or peanut. In Paoskoto, wetter conditions allow farmers to produce maize, especially early-maturing varieties (the most popular one is an 80-day variety known as Early Thai). Rainfed rice (Oryza sativa) is also cultivated in valley bottoms and some farmers grow water melon and pumpkin in compound plots. In both communities, farmers usually plant millet prior to the rain, applying varying amounts of organic manure and, sometimes, chemical fertilizers. Peanut and maize are generally sown after a few big rains when farmers believe that the rainy season has really started. In Paoskoto, farmers tend to use fertilizers and pesticides on peanut and maize, though they mentioned the high price of chemical inputs as a constraint.

Food web interactions among insect pests of rice and their numerous natural enemies in paddy fields - in the absence of high pesticide applications - can be very complex, often resulting in low but stable insect populations. In most early-season tropical rice fields, abundant populations of generalist predators can be found in (Settle et al. 1996). These generalist predators are likely to be supported, in the early season, by feeding on abundant populations of detritus- feeding and plankton-feeding insects, whose populations consistently peak and decline in the first third of the season. The abundance of alternative prey gives the predator populations a ``head start'' on later-developing pest populations, thus enabling them to strongly suppress pest populations and generally lend stability to rice ecosystems by decoupling predator populations from a strict dependence on herbivore populations. These and other observations support management strategies that promote the conservation of existing natural biological control through a major reduction in insecticide use, and the corresponding increase in habitat heterogeneity.

Thus, this study compared the efficiency of rice production between large-scale irrigation schemes and small-scale irrigation schemes using household data collected in the Senegal Ricer Valley. The regression analyses demonstrate that large-scale irrigation schemes are as efficient as small-scale irrigation schemes when we control for the quality of irrigation facilities. That is, the seemingly better performance of large-scale irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley mainly comes from better management of irrigation facilities at the scheme level. However, the small-scale irrigation schemes are heterogeneous since they include village-based collective irrigation schemes and private irrigation schemes. If we compare large-scale schemes with village-based small-scale ones only, the former perform better even after controlling for observed advantage. The results imply that village-based small-scale collective irrigation schemes have inherent problems in irrigation management. Thus, we conclude that a part of the reason for the high productivity in rice farming in the Senegal River Valley can be attributed to the advantage of large-scale irrigation schemes over small-scale schemes.

First, studies on group decisions revealed that groups significantly outperform individuals in the estimation of judgmental variables (Bonner, Sillito and Baumann 2007; Sniezek and Henry 1989). Given this bias argument, understanding the group estimation process is of clear relevance to social science and to organizations. Secondly, this study is embedded in a larger framework of experimental value chain research, in which it is believed that competitiveness of the food sector in developing countries can be increased through collective value chain and generic promotion strategies exploiting, to a maximum extent, social capital and networks. Finally, rice is the most important staple crop in Senegal and more important in relative terms to the poorest tercile of consumers than to the richest in urban areas (Reardon 1993). Food security and self-sufficiency are public goods and, hence, social normative processes in perceived quality and buying intentions (Obermiller and Spangenberg 1989) may be successfully deployed in generic promotion programs of local SRV rice.

This shows that the farmers of the two sites (Ndiaye and Fanaye) are interested in these two types of lines especially intra-specific lines, including those from the series of WAS173, who presented the best average grain yields. The duration sowing maturity seems to be variously appreciated by sites. The farmers of the site Ndiaye, have far more privileged earliness while those of Fanaye area, chose the varieties with average cycle or a long cycle. Discussions with farmers highlighted a preference for early cycles in the delta (Ndiaye) unlike the peasants of the Middle Valley (Fanaye), which seem to opt for medium or long cycles. The Delta area is characterized by salinity of soil and seasonal temperature drops. Early varieties allow them to harvest before the November drops in temperature that reduce overwintering crop yields for longer cycles, and also to practice double cropping rice / rice. Precocity is also an advantage during the semi belated, hence their preference for short cycle varieties. At Fanaye farmers prefer rather varieties with a medium or long cycle, which they consider more profitable because of better grain filling unlike the short-season varieties, which are characterized in this site by poor filling seeds.

The SRV is the core area of rice production in Senegal. It provided 80% of domestic production in 2014 (USDA, 2015). Some 45,000 family farmers are involved in rice production in the SRV (Gergely and Baris, 2009). At the scale of the region of Saint Louis which includes Dagana Department, 39.5% of households were poor in 2010 (ANSD, 2010). And 16.1% of households in Dagana Department were affected by food insecurity (WFP, 2014). More information about the rice VC and the study area is given based on the requirements of the research questions addressed in each chapter. 25 Data are available at http://data.worldbank.org/ Rice is a politically strategic product in West Africa because it is a major contribution to national food security. Since independence, government strategies aim at supplying rice at low prices to the population. Certain researchers consider that there was an “urban bias” during the three last decades. Indeed, little support was given to agricultural production, and the strategy was to import cheap rice for urban consumers, who make up the main part of voters (Bezemer and Headey, 2008). Policies implemented after the price crisis also purport to supplying low-cost rice, but now through modernization of the domestic rice chain.

Farmers also tend to prefer older seedlings, and consider them better adapted to agronomic stresses. For example, several participating farmers experienced problems with seedling mortality in SRI, which necessitated post-transplant gap filling. Poor land leveling is common in the study region, and farmers experienced failed crop establishment in field depressions where single, young SRI seedlings became submerged and/or washed away during the first irrigation, supporting Senthilkumar et al. (2008) and Tsujimoto et al. (2009), who observed similar problems in India and Madagascar, respectively. Several SRI studies have also examined the effect of seedling number and transplanting age on yield (e.g., Latif et al., 2009; Tsujimoto et al., 2009), though the advantages of either practice remain inconclusive. We therefore suggest that it is best to adopt a flexible approach to transplanting practices, only using single, young seedlings in low-risk environments where farmers are certain of their ability to minimize constraining agronomic and social factors.

Nevertheless, a gender lens is essential because peasant seed selection and food functions are connected with African gender social norms and division of labor which impact food practices and activities (Westholm and Ostwald, 2020). This invisibility and underestimation of the crucial role of rural women in the use and conservation of seeds was pointed out in particular by Patricia Howard (2003). This book documented extensively that the knowledge and use of plant biodiversity is genderdifferentiated everywhere. It defends the statement that gender perspective change our understanding of people-plant relationships in fundamental ways. In particular, when women select varieties for their fields or gardens, they consider not only agronomic characteristics, but also those related to processing, storage, consumption and the health needs of family members and domestic animals.

The results are summarized in table 3 below. Components most appealing to farmers were: fertilizer and weed management, use of improved varieties and harvesting/post harvest technologies. In general, farmers attributed the superior performance of RICM to management factors. Application of urea in three splits is perceived to have a yield increasing effect, while use of basal phosphorus is perceived to affect high tillering and yield. The perceived positive attribute of herbicide use is its labor saving effect. However, only half of the respondents plan to use herbicides for weed control, citing the high cost of herbicides as the main reason. Farmers also indicated that where labor is not a major constraint in the household, the need for chemical weed control is minimal. Respondents also consider the higher grain quality and good taste of the improved variety Sahel 202 as important, but cited problems of seed availability as a constraint to potential use. Most farmers indicated they would reduce seeding rates to appropriate levels only when certified seed is available.

(2000, 2001) demonstrated the profitability of improved soil fertility and weed management for small and large scale rice farmers in Senegal and Mauritania. Another possibility to raise profitability would be to improve the quality of rice produced. Price differences in Senegal between low and high quality rice are huge. Whole grain American rice is sold in the Senegalese capital Dakar for 380 CFA1 kg−1, whole grain rice imported from India of lower quality (dark color, relative high percentage of impurities) sells for 190 CFA kg−1. Imported broken rice from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan and Argentina sells for 160–175 CFA kg−1. An estimated 350,000–450,000 t of rice is consumed annually in Senegal, of which 15,000 tons is whole grain rice.

Consolidated in 2012 through a series of meetings and workshops with key stakeholders, these models have enabled the sale of nearly 20,000 T and mobilized more than US $11 million.35 Contractualization eventually emerged in two forms: (1) between banks and producers, and (2) in a three-way relationship between the bank, producer, and processor. In the first form, farmers were required to find their own purchaser, which often led to delays in sales and in farmers’ receiving payment. In the second form, banks provided credit to farmers who sold the contract on a forward sale to a processor, all of which was done at a price agreed in advance. Once transfer to the processor actually took place, the proceeds were used to repay the loan, with the loan now being between the bank and the processor. In this process, no cash was actually used; repayment was effectively in the form of paddy rice deposited in a warehouse. Bank credit was issued to farmers that allowed them to buy inputs through vouchers; farmers deposited their production in processors’ warehouses and received a warehouse receipt that was considered as payment once it was transferred to the bank. This economized on cash.	SCALING UP OF SAHEL RICE VARIETIES IN SENEGAL REVIEW OF SUCCESSFUL SCALING OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES	the United States Agency for International Development	2016

This ``Farmer Adapted System of Rice Intensification'', or FASRI, was subsequently compared to FP, RMP and ASRI in the 2008 wet season (WS08) and 2009 dry season (DS09). Weed biomass was sampled during these seasons from two randomly placed 50 cm2 quadrats plot-1 at ~15, 30-35 DAT, and booting. Herbicide use was measured by noting their volume and dilution of in backpack sprayers before and after application. Farmers were equipped with stopwatches to collect real-time labor data, and price information was gathered from a database maintained by AfricaRice (see Demont et al. 2009). Yields were analyzed by ANVOA for a RCBD using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Inst., San Francisco); weed data were subjected to repeated measures ANOVA.

First, organizations should be considered in their diversity. In particular, MOs and COs do not require similar types of assistance. MOs typically generate income opportunities for their members, and management capacity is crucial for the organization to access resources and manage them effectively. By contrast, COs are essentially redistributive organizations. For this reason, financial support to COs through grants and loans is critical for them to have public goods and transfers that they can distribute to members. Second, VOs are highly dependent on the community context in which they evolve. In some cases, efforts should be made to encourage the emergence of MOs otherwise constrained, either through support to local entrepreneurs, or through the provision of efficient insurance mechanisms so that differentiation is no longer perceived as a threat to the community. The encouraging observation is that elite capture and corruption do not appear to be constraining factors on performance. What organizations need to effectively make a difference in enhancing revenues for their members and their communities is greater access to professional capacity building and to financial resources. Only then will extensive presence of organizations translate into more than penny capitalism, and effectively support successful smallholder agricultural development and improved rural well being in West Africa.

Although rice consumption requires some importation, the government of each country expects to strengthen domestic rice production along large rivers for easy irrigation in terms of food security. However, productivity is sluggish owing to the lack water management systems for rivers. The risk of flooding and the high fluctuation of the water level between the wet and dry seasons decrease farmers' motivations toward agricultural investment. To improve domestic food production, stable access to a water resource should be achieved. In this study, we suggest optimum flooding control scenarios by reproducing a flooding event and for the case study we identify various factors affecting the reproducibility of the computational fluid dynamics simulation of the Senegal River bank in Mauritania. Furthermore, optimal water usage is also considered in the scenarios to provide a stable irrigation water supply in the dry season. This study not only introduces the decision process for flood control and water use scenarios, but also discusses the technical points to carry out this process.

Looking at the socio-economic situation, rice production in the River Delta Valley today is more profitable both for male and females as a result of the agricultural intensification. However, the high-intensive form of agriculture demands significant investments since inputs are costly. When asked whether they thought they were economically better off today than 10 years previously, both male and female respondents from all four data collection locations were quite unsure. Most respondents answered that although they now had a more substantial income from their rice production, their agricultural expenses had increased significantly as well. So ultimately, they were left with close to nothing at the end of the day.	The gender gap in agricultural productivity	Matilda Strand	2019

Despite the constraints mentioned above, the average yield level during the surveyed period amounted to 5.32 t.ha−1, which is well above the average of 3.62 t.ha−1 in irrigated rice cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa (Rodenburg and Johnson 2009). However, with regard to the yield potential as mentioned above and within a context of availability of improved technologies, this performance could be considered as a technical regression. The highest average yield in our period of study was attained in 2004 and amounted to 5.88 t.ha−1 and the lowest in 2006, i.e. 4.04 t.ha−1. The year 2006 was particularly problematic because of the intensification of bird damage and disturbance of input supply (de Mey et al. 2012). Therefore, the maximum yields attained in this period varied from 9.01 to 12 t.ha−1 in our sample showing that the theoretical yield mentioned above can be attained at farm level.

Modernization of the rice value chain The VC that we characterize as traditional, in which producers market their paddy through spot transactions, has been operating since the 1970s. Small-scale processors use mills to husk the rice (Fall, 2006). The quality of rice is low since it contains impurities and is not sorted by grade, in addition to having a moisture content inappropriate for cooking. The small-scale processors purchase the paddy from farmers and from producer organizations through spot transactions including relational proximity. They visually check the quality of paddy for impurities. Their simple husking technique does not require complex indicators of quality in transactions. Producer organizations that benefit from a credit from CNCAS market their paddy to the small-scale processors and repay the loan to the bank with the money they get for the sale. The selling price of paddy through spot transactions varies considerably over the season. This traditional VC concerned 87% of paddy produced in 2014 in the SRV.

No other country in sub-Saharan Africa is so dependent on food imports. Rice imports into Senegal, particularly, consist almost entirely of broken rice. In international markets, broken rice is considered an inferior product and is therefore much cheaper than whole-grain rice. However, Senegalese consumers have developed a marked preference for imported broken rice. Even in major rice production regions, such as Saint-Louis, urban consumers are paying price premiums averaging 15% relative to mixed-grain rice produced in the Senegal River Valley (SRV) as Figure 1 shows. Because of its dominance, in this study we focus on broken rice, termed simply ‘rice’ hereafter for brevity.

Inundation shapes depend on the resolution of the DEM. Moreover, inundation areas are affected by micro-morphologies, such as canals and roads. As shown in Figure 7, roads are present on the embankment, which stands approximately 2 m higher, and these obstruct the extension of inundations. In contrast, canals dug by farmers connect directly to tributaries, so flooding can easily occur during the high water stage. To express an inundation area with high reproducibility, DEM at high resolution should be used. However, the computational time needed for a simulation increases with increasing DEM resolution. To avoid this, we tried to employ a General Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU), which is a parallel computing unit. The GPGPU was developed based on the graphics board found in many computers, and has already been applied in a previous study using a CFD simulation based on the 2-dimensional shallow-water equation. In the previous study, the GPGPU improved the computational time and the accuracy of the simulation for a fine-grid DEM (Zeng et al., 2013). Based on this study, 30 m of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data was considered in our CFD simulation using the GPGPU. In this simulation, 170 canals, roads, and tributaries were considered in the simulation. Figure 8 shows the result of the simulation with GPGPU, which significantly improved the simulation’s accuracy when compared to the images in Figure 6.

(1992), Carrasco-Tauber and Moffitt (1992), Chambers and Lichtenberg (1994), Saha Et al. (1997), Huang Et al. (2002), Norwood and Marra (2003), Qaim (2003) and Shankar and Thirtle (2005). This output oriented damage abatement specification (i.e. DA inputs reduce the loss inflicted on potential output) was questioned however by Carpentier and Weaver (1997), who proposed an input damage abatement specification which was further elaborated by Oude Lansink and Carpentier (2001). The input damage abatement specification is a more general treatment and is based on the principle that DA inputs have an impact on the productivity of productive inputs. Zhengfei et al. (2005) expanded the DA literature further by proposing an input damage abatement specification that allows marginal products of pesticides to be negative (these were presumed to be positive a priori in previous literature) and allows inputs to be both damage abating and yield increasing. One year later, Zhengfei et al. (2006) broadened this DA framework by presenting a new dichotomous paradigm based on agronomic insights that categorizes inputs into growth- and facilitating inputs. Kuosmanen, Pemsl and Wesseler (2006) step aside from the standard production function approach to estimate the productivity of damage control inputs and employ a two-stage semi parametric technique to estimate the productivity of damage control inputs. This approach combines the attractive features of both nonparametric features (e.g. no need for assumptions about functional forms and parameter restrictions) and parametric features (e.g. the ability to summarize productivities into a single coefficient). In this specification, they specify damage agent variables as slope dummies, which they show to have a major impact on the effectiveness of the DA inputs they considered. Despite the recent development of the input DA approach in the literature, an output DA approach can still be meaningful however when an input DA approach is not preferable due to its high level of non-linearity and the related estimation problems.

However, the consumption of the previously mentioned species has decreased although some of them are still much appreciated foods, especially for their seeds (called Pode); they are available in the market. One woman explained: 'The disappearing crops means that people stop eating these foods.

The inland valleys comprise a huge production potential that is yet underexploited. In these areas, weeds are a major constraint as water control is poor, and the soil is fertile and either wet or moist for much of the year. Rice production in the inland valleys is mainly for subsistence (Windmeijer and Andriesse, 1993). Land preparation is mostly done by hand and fields are often inadequately bunded and leveled resulting in uneven flooding and patchy conditions favoring weed growth (Akobundu and Fagade, 1978; Ampong-Nyarko, 1996). Uncontrolled flooding also 198 J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson renders the use of herbicides less effective (Akobundu, 1987). The lack of a permanent and adjustable water layer favors weed infestations, such as observed with wild rice in Tanzania (Riches et al., 2005), and leads to severe crop–weed competition.

Fewer studies have focused on temperature rise effects on weeds (Tungate et al., 2007) or on combined effects of CO2 and temperature increases (Coleman and Bazzaz, 1992; Nonhebel, 1996; Williams et al., 2007). Fewer still peer-reviewed studies report on specific investigations of the effect of drought or water-stress on crop-weed interactions (Moffett and McCloskey, 1998). Studies have not been undertaken on the combined effects of the three main anticipated climate change causes/effects (e.g., CO2, temperature and drought) on rice-weed competition. Controlled experiments with field crops and weeds are however difficult and costly to conduct, and the absence of the resources and facilities to conduct such experiments in Africa suggests that partnerships with institutes and universities elsewhere would be advantageous. Anticipated climate changes will bring changes in species distribution and predicting these changes is an important task for weed science (Fernandez-Quintanilla et al., 2008). The anticipated changes will need to be considered in the context of emerging constraints such as demographic changes and water shortages. Integrated management options should be developed that on one hand arrest potential increased losses to weeds due to changing climatic and environmental conditions and that prevent climate change to aggravate on the other hand (Ingram et al., 2008).

So, the originality and innovative nature of this project is threefold: 1. It was based on the definition of the research subject established in close collaboration with local NGOs, farmers’ organizations and the civil society; 2. It was linked to the deep nature of the academic TD effort implemented where the combination of social sciences and biotechnical science presented difficulties, both theoretical and practical; 3. It was crossed by a gender analysis that is not only focused on gender relations in the family and community but also concerned technical agricultural observations on biodiversity management and nutritionals records. The primary aim of this article is to give a multidimensional and comprehensive (relational) view of the consequences of the recent evolution of agriculture in Middle Senegal Valley. The dimensions considered are the cultivated biodiversity, the female agricultural and culinary activities, gender relations within the family and the nutritional quality of family food. The second aim is methodological: as we consider the DIVA project as an experiment in TD research, we make a reflexive return to what is at stake in terms of conception of research, methods and results’ analyses.

The CCC model constructs all possible single/double/triple sowing date configurations, taking into account that: 1. Growing periods may not overlap and this should also go well across calendar years. 2. There must be at least DURHASOW days between harvesting one crop and sowing the next crop. This rule is applied both for the rice and the vegetable crop. 3. We considered only closed annual crop rotations, i.e. we fitted two or three crops into one year.

This sample was constituted by nine families, three families in each village, involved in subsistence-oriented farming and with variations in socio-economic level and number of family members. Within these families, we have worked with 12 households (locally called foyré), considered as a set of people sharing the same meal. The foyré is also a socio-economic space of production and reproduction. This overlapping of status within the productive sphere and within the family explains the invisibility of women’s work, especially as regards irrigated rice cultivation where it is considered as marginal and qualified by the women themselves as ‘help’.

On each sheet, a number of rows symbolized different fields. Three columns on the left side of the sheet contained information characterizing each field, namely whether compound or bush field, prevailing soil type using farmer defined categories, and main crop and crop variety grown (see Fig. 2). It was assumed that each field had only one crop and one variety of that crop. A top row represented the sequence of dekads, spanning from the last dekad of May to the first one of November. At the end of each dekad, farmers were then given information about the total rainfall obtained during that dekad. On this sheet, workshop participants represented their crop management tasks (sowing, applications of organic manure, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, weeding and harvesting) for each dekad and each field. Using different colors, which they helped to select at the start of the workshop, farmers drew colored circles representing each task and a black cross for ‘‘no action’’. At the extreme right of the sheet a last column elicited participants’ assessment on a scale of 1 (very bad yield) to 5 (very good yield) of what the crop yield might be in light of the conditions and practices entered (Fig. 2). This initial phase was repeated for years 1977, 1979, 1992 in Paoskoto and years 1960, 1966, and 1985 in Bacfassagal, and was used as a baseline, to represent what farmers do normally, based on rainfall received but without access to forecast information.

This was because farmers felt that irrigation fees were already too high. The difficulties farmers noted in achieving water-savings on one hand, and their interest in reducing irrigation costs on the other, represents a conflict between farmers' preferences and ability to practice water-saving irrigation. Though farmers' impressions could change with additional experience, higher fuel costs, or increased physical water scarcity, only farmers from the small-scale and privately managed Oumar Youness irrigation scheme considered AWD to be feasible. For the time being, irrigation cost reductions may be more easily achieved by reducing conveyance losses, and by maintaining pumps for high fuel efficiency. Future efforts to realize water-savings should consider not just agronomic management at the farmers' scale, but also improved engineering, collective action, and governance at the irrigation scheme level, as mutually reinforcing, and equally important goals (Sserunkuuma et al., 2009).

The other varieties are still available locally, preserved by some families and sold in the bush markets; they are still present, too, in culinary memories. The women were able to accurately describe the characteristics of the grain and flour, the related agricultural practices (e.g. crop cycle, seasonality), the interests and disadvantages of cultivating the variety, and the management of seeds. This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women. All these varieties were local or peasant. A summarized description of the 8 most cited recession sorghum varieties and photographs can be found in Tables S1 and Fig. S3 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material. Briefly, the 3 most frequently cited varieties were Poordi (which means brown, the color of the seed), Mariam Sowdou (from the name of the woman who introduced and spread it) and Balieri (which means white). Yellow variety (Paaca) was also mentioned. The choice of cultivating one or another variety was guided by the length of the crop cycle (e.g. the Poordi cycle was 20 days shorter than the Balieri cycle) and bird attacks (e.g. the Balieri was less sensitive compared to Poordi). As a result, the Poordi variety was the most cultivated while its bitter taste (a protective factor against bird attacks) was less and less appreciated by the families. Among the 19 other varieties mentioned, the cultivation of most of them has been abandoned due to longer cycles (e.g. Bobo Jamm and Samba Souke). In addition, the decrease in flooding for several consecutive years has had consequences for the seed conservation of these different varieties. Because the maximum storage time is two years according to women involved in sorghum breeding, and because of the uncertainty of the next floods, women progressively stopped keeping seeds and preferred to buy them at the market or from neighbors. Nevertheless, some women did their best to save sorghum seeds.	Expanding and intensifying rice production consequences on agrobiodiversity management and diet quality.

In the traditional production function specification, , all inputs X are treated symmetrically, i.e. they are assumed to contribute to production in the same way. Lichtenberg and Zilberman (1986) criticized this specification by proposing an asymmetrical specification that treats productive inputs X and damage abating inputs Z differently. Their rationale behind this is that damage abating inputs are not standard factors of production that directly increase yield, but are damage control agents which indirectly mitigate yield loss through the elimination of pests. They define a specific function g(Z), the damage abatement function, to describe the DA inputs’ specific role in production: , . The DA function represents the percentage of damage that is eliminated by the use of the DA inputs Z and possesses the properties of a cumulative probability distribution: it is defined on the interval [0,1] with g = 0 meaning zero elimination of damage, g =1 denoting complete eradication of damage, it is a monotonically increasing function and g(Z) 1 when Z ∞. A simple linear form of the asymmetric specification is     , where represents minimal output and potential output on which works as a scaling factor. Choosing minimal output equal to zero, this equation is reduced to   . This equation symbolizes that the DA production function approach is based on the damage abatement process that is multiplicatively separable from the production process: the DA function g(Z), representing the percentage of prevented damage, influences potential yield f(X) as a scaling factor. Following its definition, one minus the DA function represents the pest-inflicted loss function at various pest control levels. Thus by estimating a production function with an embedded DA function, farm level bird damage estimates can be obtained by feeding the loss function with observed pest control levels. Note that the DA function uses bird control efforts as an input to represent the abatement process; hence this approach uses bird control as a proxy to estimate bird damage.

These data support McDonald et al. (2006) who showed SRI yields to be commensurate with ``Best Management Practices'', though in the present study, each far out yielded FP. But while farmers appreciated the potential for high yields and water savings with ASRI, they described labor demands for multiple mechanical weedings as onerous. Weedings also fell at a time labor was already constrained by horticultural crop requirements. Similarly, farmers described the elevated herbicide dose used in RMPs as potentially costly, and indicated that because of poorly functioning agrochemical markets, larger volumes of herbicides might be difficult to reliably source. Farmers consequently proposed testing FASRI as a fourth treatment that borrowed from both ASRI and RMP. FASRI included transplanting two 11-14 day old seedlings hill-1 at 20 x 20 cm, intermittent irrigation and recommended fertilizer rates. Weeds were mechanically controlled once with a cono weeder around 18 DAT. Herbicides (6:1 Propanil to 2,4-D ratio) were applied 12-18 days later, but only at locations in the field were weed presence warranted action.

In this regard, Berkes and Folke (1998), Folke et al (2003) and Holling (2001) described coupled social-ecological systems as co-evolved, with mutually dependent and interacting social and ecological components. Understanding these interactions in our study was key to deciphering the status and positions of actors and investigating their embedded knowledge. For example, the 'DIVA Fest,' which was a festive event held to present the results, was one of several opportunities to interact with the community. All the participants (75 people, including most of the women who were interviewed in the study) continued to provide information enriching our own survey. During this event, women further described and discussed their attempts to experiment with a new cultural association of sorghum and cowpea under irrigation. They also took advantage of the event to report the death of seedling plants due to warmer and polluted water. The women farmers also appreciated the synthesis of the researchers' results: they felt that they were understood (the study correctly reflected their point of view), that their knowledge was valued and that their difficulties were publicly expressed in a symbolic place like the town hall.

After 21 to 23 days the rice plants are transplanted into paddies in the wet season and after 24 to 25 days in the dry season. In the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) rice seeds are sown in a damp seedbed sown with a higher plant density, having a layer water of 0-1 cm. After 11 to 13 days in the wet seasons the rice plants are transplanted. In the dry season this is 14 to 15 days. Transplanted rice plants suffer less from weed competition and from limitations in land leveling, but direct seeded rice plants can be sown with a higher plant density. Fertility and weed management are timed according to transplantation or seeding day.

These data support McDonald et al. (2006) who showed SRI yields to be commensurate with ``Best Management Practices'', though in the present study, each far out yielded FP. But while farmers appreciated the potential for high yields and water savings with ASRI, they described labor demands for multiple mechanical weedings as onerous. Weedings also fell at a time labor was already constrained by horticultural crop requirements. Similarly, farmers described the elevated herbicide dose used in RMPs as potentially costly, and indicated that because of poorly functioning agrochemical markets, larger volumes of herbicides might be difficult to reliably source. Farmers consequently proposed testing FASRI as a fourth treatment that borrowed from both ASRI and RMP. FASRI included transplanting two 11-14 day old seedlings hill-1 at 20 x 20 cm, intermittent irrigation and recommended fertilizer rates. Weeds were mechanically controlled once with a cono weeder around 18 DAT. Herbicides (6:1 Propanil to 2,4-D ratio) were applied 12-18 days later, but only at locations in the field were weed presence warranted action.

Another question that arose in our work regarding diet has to be mentioned. While the kitchen space was clearly described by local women as a food space in continuity with the agricultural space where the sovereignty of women was exercised and where they expressed and improved a whole series of knowledge dishes (Fig. S4 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material), it would be desirable to continue investigations into the links between dishes and associated plants, all the more so since these are subjects that arouse great interest among women. We initiated this approach by starting with certain emblematic, such as preparations based on cowpeas or sorghum coucous (niri) whose consumption has fallen sharply due to lower production and higher purchase costs. Different preparations are associated with niri: niri Kosam (with milk), niri bouna (with dried fish) or niri beref. There are emblematic dishes, still prepared for certain occasions such as baptisms and weddings and associated with good health and culinary heritage. This study confirms, notably following Howard (2003), that culinary traditions are a major element in the preservation of wild and cultivated biodiversity. If culinary traditions are diminishing, the reasons for conserving these plants useful for food, as well as the knowledge associated with them (cultivation, processing, and storage) are also being lost. Thus, the work of women in the transmission of culinary knowledge is of great importance, and this makes the kitchen the primary place for maintaining biodiversity. In addition to being a place for conserving plants, the kitchen is also a place for creating emotions and memories. Thus, to evoke food and its evolution is also to evoke the memories associated with it by appealing to the senses.

IWMmay combine preventive measures with interventions, and short-term with long-term approaches, to sustainably reduce yield losses due to weeds. It is opined that this can contribute to reductions in input expenses and to the robustness of long-term weed management (Swanton and Weise, 1991). Rice cropping systems in Africa may often be suitable for integrated approaches to pest management. Farmers are often constrained by a lack of finance, information, and inputs and therefore are often reliant on traditional methods. Weed management practices based on cultural and integrated approaches may be more compatible with farmers’ resources than single-component technologies requiring high levels of external inputs ( Johnson, 1995).

Reducing dependence on rice import and achieving national food security will certainly require supportive measures that can lead to the creation of opportunities for rice production, e.g., improving rice production through irrigation systems, ensuring a stable supply of input goods, stabilizing producer prices, and providing agricultural credit.

In the case of the paddy fields adjacent to the palm woods in the Karongue village of the Diouloulou Department, the pH value of the paddy soils up to 50 cm in depth were 3.6 to 4.0. The surface soil was gray sandy loam, and from the 30cm in depth and below was whitish sand. So the cause of the problem was considered not salinity that the farmer complained, but strong acidity seeped horizontally from the lowland near the water course through phreatic layer. When calcium carbonate was applied at a rate of 1.5 to 3.0 ton/ha to the surface soils of 10 to 20 cm depth, paddy growth was improved, and the soil pH was measured at 4.6 to 5.1 after the rainy season in January of the following year.

As noted above, certified seed production has expanded steadily, though would need to expand further to cover all farmers in the delta part of the SRV. According to PCE's own data, in FY 2014, 26,530 hectares were being farmed under contractualization across all crops, with probably around half in irrigated rice. Further spread of contractualization is limited by CNCAS's own capital limits--as of early 2016 it was Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal 39 looking for further capital increases--as well as the limitations of the existing versions of crop insurance. Farmers will also need to be fully insured from adverse events, especially in the hivernale season with the increased frequency of floods, damaging rain, and bird and pest attacks. Until that happens, it is likely that more farmers will fall back into arrears, becoming ineligible for credit, and many others will be less eager to produce in the hivernale season. The same is true of the timeliness of bank credit approval; as of this coming crop year (2016-2017), CNCAS was willing to experiment with approving credit for the entire year, versus the current practice of season by season.

This was because farmers felt that irrigation fees were already too high. The difficulties farmers noted in achieving water-savings on one hand, and their interest in reducing irrigation costs on the other, represents a conflict between farmers' preferences and ability to practice water-saving irrigation. Though farmers' impressions could change with additional experience, higher fuel costs, or increased physical water scarcity, only farmers from the small-scale and privately managed Oumar Youness irrigation scheme considered AWD to be feasible. For the time being, irrigation cost reductions may be more easily achieved by reducing conveyance losses, and by maintaining pumps for high fuel efficiency. Future efforts to realize water-savings should consider not just agronomic management at the farmers' scale, but also improved engineering, collective action, and governance at the irrigation scheme level, as mutually reinforcing, and equally important goals (Sserunkuuma et al., 2009).

While the component practices used in FAP are likely to be of broader value, farmers’ circumstances will vary across the Senegal River Valley, and within the greater Sahel or sub-Saharan Africa. Participating farmers from the current study are also likely to pro-actively modify, learn from and further improve the techniques that comprise FAP, possibly resulting in new and useful agronomic innovations. We therefore wish to place emphasis on the processes of farmer–researcher innovation, and local technology adaptation, rather than on FAP as a technical product. To this end, the methodology detailed in this study will be most beneficial in multi-season efforts in which extension agents work closely with farmers to trial new crop management techniques, and/or as an amendment to Farmer Field Schools. Under these circumstances, we suggest that experiential learningbased approaches could yield similar benefits elsewhere, and should consequently be encouraged in adaptive research and extension activities.

Because MOs provide support to production and marketing activities, one could expect that richer households benefit more from these organizations. Although our indicator is binary and does not capture possible differences in the level of benefits, the absence of clear differences does suggest that MO activities are in general equally favorable to all their members. However, as is clear from Table 1, a number of MOs also undertake public goods activities. One may, therefore, argue that poorer households, less able to benefit from production or marketing activities, essentially benefit from MOs through these public goods transfers. To test this hypothesis, we restrict in Table 9 the MO sample to organizations that do not provide public goods. There is no indication of differences in benefit rates across welfare classes. We thus conclude that there is no visible elite capture of MO benefits. Weak performance of MOs in creating benefits for their members must thus come from another factor than elite capture. Indeed, we have seen that high concern with equity in setting up bureaucratic procedures, which is effective in fending off elite capture, may occur at the cost of efficiency.

Farmers still expect most of their risk to be borne by other parties, while private-sector actors are reluctant to become entangled in lop-sided relationships where their risk is higher than their returns. Enhanced interaction among different actors can improve their appreciation for each other’s motivations and operational tactics, providing a strong foundation for win-win relationships to develop. Past efforts in other sectors have shown that buyer/seller events can provide the structure for this interaction to occur. These events may be more social in nature, for instance combined with local cultural events, or organized for more explicitly commercial purposes, such as a buying day or bourse. Thereafter, other interventions can help to provide the building blocks for ongoing risk sharing and management. Production planning among farmers is a critical starting point for them to negotiate and deliver on longer-term contracts. Strategic alliances among producers, buyers or processors, and service providers can facilitate a range of forward contracting, embedded services and predictable inventory levels with acceptable levels of risk shared among all parties.

Indeed, it would be expected that these organizations providing public goods benefit at least all their members, if not the entire community.

Indeed, being essentially redistributive organizations, COs may facilitate rent seeking behavior from some of its members.

Unfortunately, the villagers were very unlikely to be able to use their own money to add to their allotted 0.2 ha for tomato cropping in the sandy-plain farmland due to the limited total acreage of the sandy-plain farmland and the limited number of diesel lifting pumps. Therefore, the Peasant Organization could not expect to discharge its liabilities and acquire credit in the coming seasons from CNCAS, which bases its approval of credit on past repayment rates. Within this context, almost half the members of the Peasant Organization decided to plant tomatoes in the western floodplain farmland.

Among the 17 member states of the Africa Rice Center (WARDA), annual rice consumption per person nearly doubled during the last 25 years leading up to 1995, from 14.7 kg in 1970 to 25.1 kg in 1995. With current high population growth rates, it is realistic to expect rice demand in the region to continue increasing in the short to medium term. Although there have been moderate increases in rice production in the region, the growth rate in rice production has not kept up with increases in demand and consumption. The average annual growth rate for rice production between 1973 and 1993 was 5.2%, compared to an annual consumption growth rate of 6%.

As a consequence of population growth and changing consumption patterns, the rice area in Africa is increasing (Table 1) although, at the same time, rural to urban migration is causing labor shortages in some rural rice growing areas. These changes are likely to cause a shift away from labor-intensive practices and to favor the implementation of direct-seeding (Rao et al., 2007), increased herbicide applications, reduced soil tillage operations, and increased cropping intensities. As a result, there are likely to be shifts in the composition in weed flora, a greater risk of herbicide resistance, and an increase in the incidence of challenging weed problems.

The lean period is a constant preoccupation for women. The participatory survey revealed that in the Waalo rice enters into land competition with the traditional floodbased organization and that this poses a real problem for families because of the attachment to traditional systems for technical, economic, food and cultural reasons, as other authors have found (Le Roy, 2007; Bruckmann, 2018). As typically in small family farming, the diversification of sources of income and food production is the main strategy of the families. The recession cultivation of sorghum fulfilled this function perfectly because it cost much less to grow (requiring less work and no inputs) and provided more money than rice that is sold by the kilo for twice the price. Nevertheless, such a strategy faced several limitations. Aiming for food security much more than for the achievement of good rice yields placed the families at odds with the demand of the public authorities transmitted by SAED which relates only to the objectives in terms of irrigated area and annual production: the rice production is expected to increase from 455,000 tons in 2018 to 875,000 tons in 2020. As a consequence of this mismatch between local and national objectives, families cannot but deplore the lack of technical and financial support from public authorities for the carrying out of diversification activities. Another important limitation was the land constraint, especially because the Waalo lands prone to flood recession culture are never sold if not occupied by rice, tomato or onion (Bruckmann, 2018). According to the perception of being food secure, defined by families as being able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and having extra assets from off-farm activities or expatriates, different strategies of production and limitations were described (Table 1).

Using the DA approach, the average damage was estimated at 11.2% of potential yield during the same period. For both estimation approaches, substantial variability between farmers and years was observed however with most weighted standard deviations equaling or even exceeding the means. These large differences can be attributed to the multitude of factors influencing bird damage. Both figures are in accordance with the order of magnitude derived from the literature. Note that all the damage figures reported are only valid for wet season production. Damage during the dry season is expected to be higher according to the literature (Ruelle and Bruggers, 1982). However, only half of our surveyed farmers confirmed this statement.

The characteristics of imported rice (quality, price) induce changes in the market shares of the different rice categories and partly explain the relative competitiveness of local rice. Deficiencies are noted, mainly the lack of market and price control, the lack of promotion and communication measures on local rice (quality, price, availability, etc.), the lack of a technical basis for setting the price of paddy and white rice, (farm production account, cost of processing white rice).

As the yield level is rather low at present, it is relatively easy to increase yield and profit by improving rice growing environment through strict farm management. In the various demonstration plots, the paddy yield increased by 150 - 250%, from 0.6 - 2.0 ton/ha to 2.0 - 3.8 ton/ha, by applying 50 to 70 kgP2O5/ha as TSP or DAP under the ridges and 40 to 50kgN/ha as urea once or in two split times. This yield increment, if converted into milled rice price, will bring about the net profit by at least 250% to 450% of investment on fertilizer. For extending such fertilizer application technique, it is first to be done that the local technician show farmers the effectiveness of the technique and expected benefit through the field demonstration. In each village, at least a measuring tape and a balance should be equipped so that they could calculate and weigh the necessary amount of fertilizer through the measurement of the field plot area. Each farmer should learn the necessary amount of fertilizer in each parcel using locally available material such as empty cans as measuring unit. For this, training of trainer is necessary to train a leader who could design fertilizer application plan and guide other farmers.

Improving soil fertility management through knowledge of soil fertility at the regional level and use of crop growth modeling to simulate potential yield and to match timing of N applications to the growth stage of the rice plant resulted in considerable yield increases. Combined with improved weed management these recommendations decreased the yield gap between farmers' yield and a target yield (80% of potential yield) by almost 2 t. Partial budgeting showed the profitability of the improved management practices. Including treatment independent costs in the economic analysis showed an average increase in net revenues of 85% compared to farmers' practice. The highest investment resulted in the least risk and highest minimum net benefits. Further improvement in fertilizer use efficiency can be expected from knowledge of soil nutrient supply at field or farm level. This is not yet an option however for irrigated rice farmers in the region. Current research aims at understanding farmers' decision making, to accelerate dissemination of the new recommendations.

The observed deviations from optimal timing were smaller, which may have been caused by the in¯uence of the recommended practices being applied on the neighboring T1, T2 and T3 plots. Low TP yields can partly be attributed to sub-optimal and highly variable N doses, lack of P fertilization on S .M .

The few active weed scientists in Africa often lack facilities and resources to validate herbicide resistance. Little information is available to farmers and the choice of herbicides to manage the risks of resistance is not available. Herbicide use is expected to increase in the near future and, with it, resistance is likely to develop. Environmental changes can accelerate this and, for example, raised CO2 levels have been shown to increase the tolerance of weeds to herbicides (Ziska et al., 1999; Ziska and Teasdale, 2000). Reasons behind this effect are not clear, however, rising CO2 levels may alter transpiration, reduce the number of leaf stomata or alter the thickness of the weed leaf, and thereby reduce the absorption or uptake of the pesticide (Ziska, 2008). Increased leaf starch concentrations caused by elevated CO2, as found in C3 plants (Wong, 1990), might also affect herbicide activity (Patterson et al., 1999).

However, in recent years, the consumption of rice has rapidly increased. Particularly, in West African countries, annual rice consumption per capita has tripled over the past 40 years (Africa Rice Center, 2005). This increase, observed in the urban areas, is perhaps because rice requires a shorter time to cook than other cereals (Hiraoka, 2017). In West African countries, where economic development is expected to accelerate in the future, urbanization is expected to be promoted partly by increasing rice consumption (Tsuboi et al., 2008). However, the domestic production of rice remains low, as evidenced by the 2.5 [t/ha] of land-based rice productivity in West Africa in 2005 (Africa Rice Center, 2007). According to Figure 1, recently, consumption has significantly exceeded production. To meet the increasing demand for rice, 6 million tons of rice are imported every year (Stryker, 2013). In 2008, when the food crisis occurred, a significant number of West African countries experienced starvation due to steep increases in the price of imported rice. In terms of food security, the governments of these countries have adopted certain agricultural policies and projects to strengthen the rice production sector (Dupraz et al., 2013).

Despite the presence of chlorophyll and photosynthetically active leaves (Press et al., 1991), these parasitic plants can severely reduce growth and development of the infected host plant. They parasitize host roots through a xylem-to-xylem connection made by a special organ, the haustorium (Parker and Riches, 1993). Through this connection, the parasite subtracts host-plant metabolites, water, nutrients, and amino acids (e.g., Press et al., 1987; Rogers and Nelson, 1962) and alters the hormone balance (Drennan and El Hiweris, 1979; Frost et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1996).

In 1994, three new rice varieties were released to farmers in the Senegal River Valley (SRV), the major irrigated rice region in Senegal. The productivity advantage of the new varieties is based primarily on early maturity, which permits double-cropping. (The seeds are also higher yielding than existing cultivars.) We use a conventional [Akino and Hayami (1975), am. J. Agric. Econ. 57, l-10] partial-equilibrium model adapted to the Senegalese situation, to assess the social benefits of research and compare those to its costs in calculating the internal rate of return (IRR). To account for uncertainty regarding the future values of model variables we use simulation which allows us to generate a distribution of all possible outcomes of the IRR. We find that rice research is almost certain to have a very high payoff over the 1995-2004 period. The expected value of the IRR is calculated to be 121% per year, with a 97.5% probability that it lies above annual capital costs of 18%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights reserved.

This time farmers were also provided with climate forecasts, including a seasonal rainfall before the first dekad of the year and 10-day rainfall forecasts at the start of each dekad. For each year we computed the probability of the seasonal rainfall having a wet, normal, or dry tendency (referring respectively to the total seasonal rainfall being above, near, or below normal). The forecast was synthesized into a brief statement such as: ‘‘the rainy season is expected to be rather wet’’ or ‘‘is expected to be not too wet and not too dry’’ in order to simplify the conventional method using tercile probabilities (see e.g. Manatsa et al.

In addition to seasonal forecasts, each 10 days, participants were provided with a forecast of cumulative rainfall for the upcoming dekad, expressed in terms of three categories: dry, wet or very wet. To reflect the inaccuracy of such forecasts, neither seasonal nor dekadal forecasts were formulated to be perfectly accurate: for example, the seasonal rainfall forecast for the 1985 rainy season predicted a dry tendency, while the actual rainfall was near ‘‘normal’’ (Table A3).

The irrigation project will divide the entire area into irrigated plots, eliminating the possibility of keeping large herds in this area during the crucial dry season. The deal MCA-Mali is proposing to the pastoralists is to allocate five hectare plots to each household. The catch is that the household will have to take a 20-year mortgage to purchase three of the five hectares. The two hectare plots ‘given’ to local households will be used as loan collateral for the purchase of the other three (Grain 2010). The pastoralists are expected to pay US$5775 to US$7700 per hectare (Oakland Institute 2011, p. 21). To put this breathtaking price in perspective, one must realise that farm workers’ wages in this area can be as low as US$1.00 to US$1.50 per day (Oakland Institute 2011, p. 31). The pastoralists will also be required to buy packets of seeds and other inputs provided by AGRA in order to cultivate the land (Grain 2010).

This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers' claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers' yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year. While this approach has obvious limitations, it nonetheless provided an estimate of potential impact of forecast use relative to a wide range of cropping practices and rainfall conditions.

The various criticisms included fact that the goals were way too ambitious, the cost per ton was way too high, there was no way the GOS would be able to obtain and distribute sufficient agricultural inputs in a timely way, and that this was simply opening the door to vast corruption by organizations without distribution networks. It was also seen as a ploy to give land to the politically favored. The word “gabegie” was widely used, meaning defective and dishonest financial management, or waste.

According to this interpretation, more social homogeneity proxies the importance of sharing norms widespread in West-African villages. More rainfall variability proxies the need for mutual insurance in response to greater risk. Because they do not directly generate monetary revenues for their members, COs do not induce economic differentiation of their members from the rest of the community. To the contrary, by providing support to local entrepreneurship, MOs are expected to induce economic and social differentiation of their members from the rest of the community. Because this may jeopardize the traditional structures of authority as well as the mutual insurance system within the community, the community will often resist the emergence of MOs (Fafchamps, 1992; Platteau, 2000). Therefore more social pressures to share (proxied by more social homogeneity) and more rainfall variability (representing the need for more sharing) can be expected to constrain the emergence of MOs. Social conservatism can limit the emergence of MOs, at a net social cost for the community (Hoff & Sen, 2006; Kuran, 1988).	Do Village Organizations Make a Difference in African Rural Development?

Although rice consumption requires some importation, the government of each country expects to strengthen domestic rice production along large rivers for easy irrigation in terms of food security. However, productivity is sluggish owing to the lack water management systems for rivers. The risk of flooding and the high fluctuation of the water level between the wet and dry seasons decrease farmers' motivations toward agricultural investment. To improve domestic food production, stable access to a water resource should be achieved. In this study, we suggest optimum flooding control scenarios by reproducing a flooding event and for the case study we identify various factors affecting the reproducibility of the computational fluid dynamics simulation of the Senegal River bank in Mauritania. Furthermore, optimal water usage is also considered in the scenarios to provide a stable irrigation water supply in the dry season. This study not only introduces the decision process for flood control and water use scenarios, but also discusses the technical points to carry out this process.

Indeed, Senegal is the largest importer of broken rice in the international rice trade. However, this preference is far more concentrated in urban areas, particularly in Dakar, where there is a history of imports of cheap broken rice from French Indochina. Even in urban areas, most consumers regularly purchase both broken and whole-grain rice. Demand for product type is often determined by recipe, with thièboudienne using broken rice and mafé using whole grain.

Although each farmer stated somewhat individual preferences, we guided the group towards consensus by asking farmers to discuss the most useful components under each theme. Following these discussions, we collectively agreed to evaluate a fourth crop management system. This system, henceforward referred to as Farmer Adapted Practice (FAP), was designed to respond to the constraints identified in earlier discussions. To maintain treatment consistency, participating farmers uniformly implemented FAP, which included transplanting three 17-19 day old seedlings per hill at 20 20 cm spacing, with recommended fertilizer management (Table 2). Farmers attempted to use alternate wetting and drying irrigation only in the late vegetative stage, primarily because they felt that floodwater was necessary to suppress early-season weed growth. To address labor demand and herbicide dependence in SRI and RMP, farmers agreed to mechanically weed once around 20 days after transplanting, and spot apply herbicides (6:1 propanil to 2,4-D ratio) 12-17 days later, only where weed presence warranted action.

The increasing demand and consumption of rice in the region cut across the socioeconomic spectrum: from poor rural and urban households, to middle class households in urban areas. Among the 17 member states of the Africa Rice Center (WARDA), annual rice consumption per person nearly doubled during the last 25 years leading up to 1995, from 14.7 kg in 1970 to 25.1 kg in 1995. With current high population growth rates, it is realistic to expect rice demand in the region to continue increasing in the short to medium term.

Given that sodium plays a role in maintaining the permeability of the soil for irrigation, the relative proportions of (Na + K) (Ca + Mg), is decisive for the agricultural use. Thus, RICHARD classification that represents the EC-%Na couple highlights the same quality water classes Excellent, Good, Acceptable, and Bad. However, some of these water classes that are suitable for agricultural use are characterized by a potential risk of soil sodisation which results in the RICHARD classification by an enrichment of coefficient corresponding to the exchangeable sodium percentage of groundwater. (Figure 6). Since the possibility of increasing this sodisation risk begins to be felt from 45 to 50% of Na [53] and become effective from 60% [54].

In this regard, Berkes and Folke (1998), Folke et al (2003) and Holling (2001) described coupled social-ecological systems as co-evolved, with mutually dependent and interacting social and ecological components. Understanding these interactions in our study was key to deciphering the status and positions of actors and investigating their embedded knowledge. For example, the 'DIVA Fest,' which was a festive event held to present the results, was one of several opportunities to interact with the community. All the participants (75 people, including most of the women who were interviewed in the study) continued to provide information enriching our own survey. During this event, women further described and discussed their attempts to experiment with a new cultural association of sorghum and cowpea under irrigation. They also took advantage of the event to report the death of seedling plants due to warmer and polluted water. The women farmers also appreciated the synthesis of the researchers' results: they felt that they were understood (the study correctly reflected their point of view), that their knowledge was valued and that their difficulties were publicly expressed in a symbolic place like the town hall.

This was because farmers felt that irrigation fees were already too high. The difficulties farmers noted in achieving water-savings on one hand, and their interest in reducing irrigation costs on the other, represents a conflict between farmers' preferences and ability to practice water-saving irrigation. Though farmers' impressions could change with additional experience, higher fuel costs, or increased physical water scarcity, only farmers from the small-scale and privately managed Oumar Youness irrigation scheme considered AWD to be feasible. For the time being, irrigation cost reductions may be more easily achieved by reducing conveyance losses, and by maintaining pumps for high fuel efficiency. Future efforts to realize water-savings should consider not just agronomic management at the farmers' scale, but also improved engineering, collective action, and governance at the irrigation scheme level, as mutually reinforcing, and equally important goals (Sserunkuuma et al., 2009).

Traditionally rice is harvested manually with a knife, which is very labour intensive. Advocates for rice agribusiness argue for providing farmers with access to agricultural equipment for harvest and postharvest activities, oriented toward commercial large-scale production. Also, the possibility of increasing rice yields in the Senegal River Valley through double rice cropping, would be very much dependent on machinery availability (combine harvester and tractor). The number of such machines are limited; and the scope for maintenance is a major constraint. Once broken, they cannot be easily repaired locally, as most of the machines are imported with no spare parts. (Brosseau et al. 2018) In the Casamance area of Senegal, the smallholder traditional rice systems suffer from severe labor shortages as young men and women leave the countryside to find work in the cities. Linares (2009) notes that: ``If Jola rice-growing systems are to avoid stagnation or gradual decline, serious efforts need to be made to mechanize agriculture. Unfortunately, however, this enormous task would require substantial financial and technical inputs that are well beyond the reach of the Senegalese state.'' Thus for both conventional and agroecological rice systems, there is a need for greater investment in appropriate mechanization.

Most of these studies consider agricultural productivity (e.g. Battese et al. 1996, Dorward 1999, Cornia 1985, Cabas Et al. 2010, Sherlund ET al. 2002). When considering Sub-Saharan Africa, agricultural productivity improvement has been the object of particular interest in the literature on economic development and poverty alleviation (Abdulai and Huffman 2000). Such studies have considered the effect on crop yields of weather (Blanc 2012, Schlenker and Lobell 2010), farm size (Cornia 1985, Byiringiro and Reardon 1996), gender and plot ownership (Goetghebuer 2011, Guirkinger and Platteau 2011, Kanzianga and Wahhaj 2010), environmental conditions (Sherlund et al. 2002), irrigation (Connor et al. 2008) or management practices (Kihanda et al. 2007, Subbarao et al. 2000, Poussin et al. 2003). Studies focusing on crop productivity along the Senegal river found that weed and N fertilizer management are major determinants of rice variability (Poussin et al. 2003) and that N fertilizer application also influences rice quality (Wopereis-Pura et al. 2002).

Surfaces covered with rice fields are smaller than they once were, and those that are cultivated do not always yield more than, at most, 1,200 kg of rice per hectare. Upland crops such as millet and sorghum are being replaced by manioc, which is tolerant of dry conditions but not very nutritious; and maize, which is more nourishing but vulnerable to pests. In some other regions, groundnut cultivation is also contracting, bringing less monetary revenue to the household. Obviously, conditions are not the same everywhere, but, overall, traditional crops are not doing as well as before, and families are poorer and less well fed. For these reasons, it is imperative for the Jola people to find new ways to intensify agriculture and raise productivity. In these efforts, women are bound to play an important role, as they indeed do in all other agricultural activities.

We were aware of these issues, and purposefully chose to work with Farmer Field School facilitators who had undergone training in interactive education and extension methodology (see van den Berg and Jiggins, 2007). As such, they were pre-disposed to value farmer experimentation. The graduation from ‘‘learning by doing’’ in the first season, to active experimentation in the second and third seasons, was therefore relatively straightforward. This process benefitted just as much from the institutional culture of the Farmer Field School system, which fostered appreciation for farmer-driven experimentation, as it did from the participatory research methods themselves (Van Mele et al., 2011).

Consolidated in 2012 through a series of meetings and workshops with key stakeholders, these models have enabled the sale of nearly 20,000 T and mobilized more than US $11 million.35 Contractualization eventually emerged in two forms: (1) between banks and producers, and (2) in a three-way relationship between the bank, producer, and processor. In the first form, farmers were required to find their own purchaser, which often led to delays in sales and in farmers' receiving payment. In the second form, banks provided credit to farmers who sold the contract on a forward sale to a processor, all of which was done at a price agreed in advance. Once transfer to the processor actually took place, the proceeds were used to repay the loan, with the loan now being between the bank and the processor. In this process, no cash was actually used; repayment was effectively in the form of paddy rice deposited in a warehouse. Bank credit was issued to farmers that allowed them to buy inputs through vouchers; farmers deposited their production in processors' warehouses and received a warehouse receipt that was considered as payment once it was transferred to the bank. This economized on cash.	SCALING UP OF SAHEL RICE VARIETIES IN SENEGAL REVIEW OF SUCCESSFUL SCALING OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES	the United States Agency for International Development	2016

Rural women are constrained because of sociocultural factors that deny them control over land resources, but also because the land legislation that does support them is not enforced. Rural women are victims of an inequitable and highly patriarchal social structure that prevents them from accessing and controlling their means of production (Niang et al. 2017:9). For example, the inheritance of land still functions according to customary land rights and is dependent on women’s marital status, meaning that women risk losing their land if they get divorced or widowed (Koopman, 2009). Looking at gender disparity statistics, Senegal’s ranking in the gender inequality index has not witnessed any improvements in women’s rights. The score of 2018 was set to 0.682, in comparison to 0.6923 in 2013 (World Economic Forum, 2013;2018). The ranking index states that the higher the score, the more gender-equal the society is. This means that Senegal’s level of gender equality has decreased by 1.49 percent from 2013 to 2018. 2.2 Senegal’s economy and labor force composition To better understand the role of rice in Senegal, we will now look at Senegal’s economy at large, and its labor force composition, which indicates a growing service sector. While figure 4 indicates that the majority of the labor force have transferred from the agricultural sector to the service sector, this corresponds to figure 5 indicating that the economic value of service sector has increased significantly in comparison to the agricultural sector. However, it should be highlighted that the informal sector in Senegal is significantly larger than the formal, meaning that important information may be hidden from official records (World Bank (2019).

They even find that farmers who benefit from credit tend to be less efficient than those who do not, which could be indicative of inappropriate loans schemes. In Malawi, access to microfinance is found not to have a significant impact on net crop income (Diagne and Zeller 2001), mostly due to the loan scheme which tends to be tied to the purchase of costly inputs (fertilizers) and to external shocks which act as a confounding factors (the case of below-average rainfall that has affected drought-sensitive crops such as maize). Khan et al. (2013) suggest similar results for Pakistani farmers: credit beneficiaries do not appear to be more productive or enjoy higher income than their counterparts. Some of the hypothesized reasons have to do with ``high interest rates, delays in credit disbursement, and lengthy procedure of getting credit'' (p. 1).

Another finding which refuted previous research was that the female participants seemed more prone than men to engage in several economic activities, including market sales. Due to the households 'non-co-operative model' in which husbands and wives do not share their incomes, women's increased revenues were not controlled by their husbands. Thus, women's commercialization of agricultural productions had, in fact, a positive effect on their empowerment.

Ndoye et al. (1996) compared the input of the GM with a mineral fertilizer input of 92 kg ha-1 on one site and 105 kg ha-1 on another site in Senegal. Yields under the GM system were significantly higher, with no chemical fertilizer input. In Fangote, the average yield over seven years under GM was 3.9 Megagram per hectare (Mg ha-1), compared to 2.0 Mg ha-1 with fertilizer input. In Oussouye the average over 6 years under GM was 4.1 Mg ha-1, compared to 2.1 Mg ha-1 with fertilizer input (Bogdanski et al. 2016). Although Green Manure incorporation is thought to incur high costs of labor, costs of fertilizer purchase and application can be higher and therefore less accessible for African smallholder farmers.

The lean period is a constant preoccupation for women. The participatory survey revealed that in the Waalo rice enters into land competition with the traditional floodbased organization and that this poses a real problem for families because of the attachment to traditional systems for technical, economic, food and cultural reasons, as other authors have found (Le Roy, 2007; Bruckmann, 2018). As typically in small family farming, the diversification of sources of income and food production is the main strategy of the families. The recession cultivation of sorghum fulfilled this function perfectly because it cost much less to grow (requiring less work and no inputs) and provided more money than rice that is sold by the kilo for twice the price. Nevertheless, such a strategy faced several limitations. Aiming for food security much more than for the achievement of good rice yields placed the families at odds with the demand of the public authorities transmitted by SAED which relates only to the objectives in terms of irrigated area and annual production: the rice production is expected to increase from 455,000 tons in 2018 to 875,000 tons in 2020. As a consequence of this mismatch between local and national objectives, families cannot but deplore the lack of technical and financial support from public authorities for the carrying out of diversification activities. Another important limitation was the land constraint, especially because the Waalo lands prone to flood recession culture are never sold if not occupied by rice, tomato or onion (Bruckmann, 2018). According to the perception of being food secure, defined by families as being able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and having extra assets from off-farm activities or expatriates, different strategies of production and limitations were described (Table 1).

In the study by IPAR and RTI International (2018), it was found that female farmers in the River Delta Valley lack the opportunity to participate in household decisions regarding agricultural production. This finding is supported by this thesis when looking to the preceding generation’s ‘one family plot’ agricultural organization as females during that time had no power in household decisions. However, when looking to the current individualized agricultural organization, the IPAR and RTI International’s findings are not supported by this thesis as women have sole decision-making power over their own rice plots. In this sense, female farmers today are very empowered. Looking at the economic aspect, despite females having fewer financial means than males, males also have economic issues. First of all, it has become more problematic for males to borrow money from banks and in addition, NGO’s and organizations tend to favor supporting women instead of males since females, in general, are more economically disempowered than males. Therefore, in comparison to the study by IPAR and RTI International (2018) which found that female farmers had inadequate access to and management of agricultural credit, the thesis results are both supportive and conflictual.

I have discussed credit repayment for rice in a previous paper (Takahashi, 2009), but it lies beyond the scope of this paper, and I will explore it in a later work. Although the villagers were unable to make a profi t after the tomato harvest, they optimistically hope to get money someday.

By using labor quantification exercises, farmers in the current study identified similar labor bottlenecks with horticultural crop activities, especially for mechanical weeding requirements in SRI (Fig. 4). However, while farmers appreciated weed control in RMP, they also noted that higher herbicide rates could be prohibitively costly. Farmers also indicated that rates greater than used in FP were not viable because of poorly functioning credit institutions and agrochemical supply chains that prohibit the timely and consistent supply of larger volumes of herbicides. The 2008 dry season trials also took place during a period of increasing fuel and electricity costs that mirrored a global spike in energy prices. Farmers at Guia-4 and Oumar Youness experienced rising diesel costs for irrigation towards the season's end. At Nianga, pump-station administrators mandated a 21% increase in water fees. These events stimulated farmers' interest in watersaving techniques, provided that weeds could be managed effectively without increasing costs.

To combat the phenomena of salinization, soil degradation and impoverishment and revitalize agroecological rice cultivation, projects and programmes must support and expand the initiation of producers to the principles of the SRI, and set up a series of hydraulic structures that can support the need to manage water on SRI principles. The successes achieved in the experimental areas have been very well received by farmers who are increasingly adopting this innovative method of rice cultivation. 4.2. Land tenure issues Current status: Land tenure in Senegal is governed by legislation giving municipality leaders control over land allocation and management. Rural councils have considerable discretionary power over land allocation. The primary means of accessing land is through inheritance, leasing, borrowing, land purchase, and allocations - all from local rural councils. Customary law, religion, and political party membership can perpetuate inequities to land access. The central government is allowed to reclassify territorial lands as pioneer lands in order to regain control. Reclassification may occur when commercial players are interested in obtaining quality farmland, especially in the Senegal River valley (USAID 2010). There are instances when rural councils collude with commercial interests at the expense of poorer farmers in areas where land is highly productive and valuable. Finally, there is no formal expropriation and compensation procedure for expropriated land taken for projects such as irrigation development (USAID 2010).

Processors suffered from acute shortages of working capital to purchase and store paddy rice until it could be processed and sold to wholesalers, and payment from wholesalers was received. Bank financing for this was not available, nor was financing available for capital investment in equipment and expanding facilities. Mills had difficulty in paying farmers for their production in a timely way, so farmers faced delays in paying off their bank loans, delaying receipt of a loan for the next season, delaying land preparation and timely planting. This delay was particularly problematic for farmers interested in adopting double cropping (i.e., planting in both the saison chaud and the hivernale). Financing for purchases of agricultural machinery was very limited as it required collateral apart from the machine itself, due to the lack of a secondary market.

This shows that the farmers of the two sites (Ndiaye and Fanaye) are interested in these two types of lines especially intra-specific lines, including those from the series of WAS173, who presented the best average grain yields. The duration sowing maturity seems to be variously appreciated by sites. The farmers of the site Ndiaye, have far more privileged earliness while those of Fanaye area, chose the varieties with average cycle or a long cycle. Discussions with farmers highlighted a preference for early cycles in the delta (Ndiaye) unlike the peasants of the Middle Valley (Fanaye), which seem to opt for medium or long cycles. The Delta area is characterized by salinity of soil and seasonal temperature drops. Early varieties allow them to harvest before the November drops in temperature that reduce overwintering crop yields for longer cycles, and also to practice double cropping rice / rice. Precocity is also an advantage during the semi belated, hence their preference for short cycle varieties. At Fanaye farmers prefer rather varieties with a medium or long cycle, which they consider more profitable because of better grain filling unlike the short-season varieties, which are characterized in this site by poor filling seeds.

Introduction Climate predictions for the African Sahel indicate rising temperatures, increases in average rainfall, higher frequency of extreme events, and greater evapotranspiration (IPCC, 2014). These types of changes have specific implications on food production systems, population mobility, and health wherever they occur. In a region already considered as one of the most vulnerable in the world due to its fragile environmental basis, high fertility rates, and undiversified economic sectors, it is likely such impacts will have lasting effects on future development trajectories (OECD 2014). Adaptation to climate change represents a key response in Sahelian countries. It is conditional on the availability of information on what to adapt to and how to adapt and the availability of resources necessary to implement the adaptation measures (Fussell and Klein, 2006). The provision of data and information on both weather conditions over the short term and climate events over the longer-term is referred to as climate information services (CIS).

Upon further inspection of the annual differences, Table 4 indicates that farmers underestimated bird damage during the agricultural seasons 2003-2004 and overestimated bird damage during the agricultural seasons 2005-2007. In relation to the summary statistics of the bird pressure dummy in Table 2, the wet seasons during 2003-2004 were perceived as having no or low bird pressure and the seasons 2005-2007 as having medium or high bird pressure. These figures suggest that farmers have a dichotomous view regarding bird damage: if (i) perceived bird pressure is low, farmers do not perceive this damage as important and tend to underestimate bird damage; but if (ii) perceived bird pressure and the related damage is high, farmers tend to overestimate the true damage caused by birds. These findings indicate that the farmers' bird damage perceptions are related to their attitudes towards risk: farmers are inclined to underestimate bird damage when risk of damage is low and to overestimate bird damage when risk of damage is high. This behavior has been studied in the psychological literature, where the comparison is frequently made between the perceived risk of traveling by air (low probability of an airplane crash but also low controllability) and traveling by car (slightly higher probability of a car crash but higher perceived controllability).

Future research may further analyze the link between farmers' risk perception, risk attitude and bird control input use and also compare risk attitude with other DA inputs such as weed control. Both the DA approach and the questionnaire survey indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficiency of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate. This underlines the importance of local bird population reduction actions by the Senegalese government and investing research in practical, economical and environmentally friendly bird control techniques.

However, diammonium-phosphate fertilizer was not available. Thus, 8.5 tonnes of urea were delivered and given to farmers at the rate of 300 kg urea ha-1. Total applied N was on average 152 kg ha-1 in the 1999 and 2000WS, with a standard deviation of about 20 kg ha-1. Compared with the 1998WS, the increase in applied N alone could not explain the increase in rice yield. The relation between total applied N and rice yield showed, in fact, that the maximum yield (about 10 t ha-1, see Fig. 2) was reached in the 2000WS with a minimum rate of about 120 kg N ha-1, i.e. equal to the average applied N rate in the 1998WS. This observation agrees well with WARDA recommendations about N fertilizer rates (Wopereis et al., 2001). Yield measured on samples overestimated the yield of fields and could therefore exceed the potential yield calculated with the model ORYZAS. Nevertheless, the maximum yield observed in the 1999 and 2000WS indicated that the potential yield for Jaya and Sahel 202 should be reached in many fields.

Senegalese rice has a number of product attributes--both tangible (e.g., taste, freshness, swelling capacity) and intangible (e.g., perception of food safety, Senegalese pride)--that are valued by consumers. However, the commercial market channel of the domestic rice industry is currently too fragmented and risk-averse to perceive and act on any upswing in market demand. Local irrigated rice must improve its awareness among consumers and make significant advances in operations and efficiency to compete more effectively with imported rice. This twopronged strategy of demand-creation and supply-response can create a mutually reinforcing feedback loop that accelerates growth and competitiveness if sufficient enabling conditions are introduced that stimulate an increased commercial orientation in the local rice industry.

Limited recent evidence is available however on the impact of birds on cereals in Africa. In order to estimate birdinflicted crop losses in rice production, we fit a production function with fixed effects and a damage abatement component with pest intensity slope dummies on a panel database of irrigated rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley. This specification enables estimating bird damage, averaging around 11.2% of the potential rice yield during the wet seasons of 2003- 2007. This translates into an average annual economic loss of 4 billion FCFA (euro6.2 million) for the irrigated rice sector in the Senegal River Valley. However, losses can amount to 9.2 billion FCFA (euro14.1 million) in years with extremely high bird pressure, such as in 2006. In comparison, farmers perceive bird damage to be on average 15.2% of the potential rice yield. Both the estimated and perceived damage abatement productivity levels indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficacy of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate. These findings highlight the need for developing enhanced bird control techniques and provide timely information for policy makers who are currently implementing an ambitious food selfsufficiency program in Senegal.

The main driver to participation in marketing and production contracts is the financial requirement of farms, mainly represented by the access of producer organizations to credit with the national bank. In Dagana Department, farmers growing rice are specialized and commercial banks are limited. The national bank is the main source of credit. Until 2010, when funded by this bank, farmers combined two types of spot transactions (including relational components): collective sales to repay the loan and individual sales to meet household's needs. However, information imperfection and enforcement failure have led to low reimbursement levels and the bank has followed several recovery plans. Policies recently set up marketing contracts to secure the reimbursement of credit in addition to improving miller supplies. The bank promotes the use of marketing contracts. Producers allowed to use a credit at the bank are therefore more likely to participate in marketing contracts, especially when they perceive high uncertainty over access of credit, outlets and price fluctuations. On the contrary, producer organizations excluded from credit by the national bank have few financing options. Exclusion from credit at the national bank has therefore a positive influence on participation in production contracts when farms are within the activity radius of rice millers that make such agreements available. Therefore, the segmentation of the credit market is linked to the indebtedness of producers to the bank. The second driver that encourages producer organizations to participate in production contracts is the perception of uncertainty over delays in access to inputs and price fluctuations. There is also a category of producers which is specialized in rice growing, excluded from the national bank credit and located beyond the reach of rice millers offering production contracts. This category has no other source of credit and was thus unable to grow rice in the dry season of 2014.

The results are summarized in table 3 below. Components most appealing to farmers were: fertilizer and weed management, use of improved varieties and harvesting/post harvest technologies. In general, farmers attributed the superior performance of RICM to management factors. Application of urea in three splits is perceived to have a yield increasing effect, while use of basal phosphorus is perceived to affect high tillering and yield. The perceived positive attribute of herbicide use is its labor saving effect. However, only half of the respondents plan to use herbicides for weed control, citing the high cost of herbicides as the main reason. Farmers also indicated that where labor is not a major constraint in the household, the need for chemical weed control is minimal. Respondents also consider the higher grain quality and good taste of the improved variety Sahel 202 as important, but cited problems of seed availability as a constraint to potential use. Most farmers indicated they would reduce seeding rates to appropriate levels only when certified seed is available.

We consider that farmers’ perceptions of credit uncertainty influence participation in contracts because these contracts were set up to secure credit reimbursement. Farmers therefore participate in contracts in order to secure their access to credit. In contrast, we consider that perceived credit uncertainty has little likelihood of influencing farmers’ outcomes (other than those generated by the contractual form) because this perception concerns only the uncertainty relating to access to credit (and not general uncertainty), and the sources of credit in the area are all related to contracts. Indeed, no farm in the sample entirely self-funded rice production because they all have low capital, specialize in rice farming and display high rice production costs (on average FCFA 517,195 per ha). The two forms of credit available to farmers come from CNCAS, which established marketing contracts, and rice millers, who established production contracts. Other sources of credit were very limited, as interlinked transactions concerned only 0.91% of the farms in the dry season 2014 and there was no credit available from commercial banks. As a result, we consider that all the sources of credit in the study area are related to contracts, so the perceived credit uncertainty has little likelihood of influencing the farmers’ technical itinerary and, subsequently, outcomes from an impact pathway other than contracts.

Limited recent evidence is available however on the impact of birds on cereals in Africa. In order to estimate birdinflicted crop losses in rice production, we fit a production function with fixed effects and a damage abatement component with pest intensity slope dummies on a panel database of irrigated rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley. This specification enables estimating bird damage, averaging around 11.2% of the potential rice yield during the wet seasons of 2003- 2007. This translates into an average annual economic loss of 4 billion FCFA (euro6.2 million) for the irrigated rice sector in the Senegal River Valley. However, losses can amount to 9.2 billion FCFA (euro14.1 million) in years with extremely high bird pressure, such as in 2006. In comparison, farmers perceive bird damage to be on average 15.2% of the potential rice yield. Both the estimated and perceived damage abatement productivity levels indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficacy of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate. These findings highlight the need for developing enhanced bird control techniques and provide timely information for policy makers who are currently implementing an ambitious food selfsufficiency program in Senegal.

The average yield in irrigated rice in the Sahel was estimated at 3.9 t ha 1 leaving an estimated yield gap (difference from potential yield) of 5.9 t ha 1 (Becker et al., 2003). Inadequate weedmanagement could explain 17% of this yield gap, and 14%was due to sub-optimal nitrogen management. Diagne et al. (2013) similarly attributed efficiency gaps in irrigated rice production in the SRV to sub-optimal weed and fertilizer management, but further identified biotic (granivorous birds), technological, organizational and institutional constraints as major factors preventing SRV farmers from achieving optimal productivity and efficiency levels. An earlier econometric study on the same panel dataset of SRV rice farmers estimated mean rice yield losses due to bird attack at 13%, which was very consistent with farmers' perceptions, who assessed the damage to be on average 15% (de Mey et al., 2012).

First, studies on group decisions revealed that groups significantly outperform individuals in the estimation of judgmental variables (Bonner, Sillito and Baumann 2007; Sniezek and Henry 1989). Given this bias argument, understanding the group estimation process is of clear relevance to social science and to organizations. Secondly, this study is embedded in a larger framework of experimental value chain research, in which it is believed that competitiveness of the food sector in developing countries can be increased through collective value chain and generic promotion strategies exploiting, to a maximum extent, social capital and networks. Finally, rice is the most important staple crop in Senegal and more important in relative terms to the poorest tercile of consumers than to the richest in urban areas (Reardon 1993).

Upon further inspection of the annual differences, Table 4 indicates that farmers underestimated bird damage during the agricultural seasons 2003–2004 and overestimated bird damage during the agricultural seasons 2005–2007. In relation to the summary statistics of the bird pressure dummy in Table 2, the wet seasons during 2003–2004 were perceived as having no or low bird pressure and the seasons 2005–2007 as having medium or high bird pressure. These figures suggest that farmers have a dichotomous view regarding bird damage: if (i) perceived bird pressure is low, farmers do not perceive this damage as important and tend to underestimate bird damage; but if (ii) perceived bird pressure and the related damage is high, farmers tend to overestimate the true damage caused by birds. These findings indicate that the farmers’ bird damage perceptions are related to their attitudes towards risk: farmers are inclined to underestimate bird damage when risk of damage is low and to overestimate bird damage when risk of damage is high. This behavior has been studied in the psychological literature, where the comparison is frequently made between the perceived risk of traveling by air (low probability of an airplane crash but also low controllability) and traveling by car (slightly higher probability of a car crash but higher perceived controllability).

First, organizations should be considered in their diversity. In particular, MOs and COs do not require similar types of assistance. MOs typically generate income opportunities for their members, and management capacity is crucial for the organization to access resources and manage them effectively. By contrast, COs are essentially redistributive organizations. For this reason, financial support to COs through grants and loans is critical for them to have public goods and transfers that they can distribute to members. Second, VOs are highly dependent on the community context in which they evolve. In some cases, efforts should be made to encourage the emergence of MOs otherwise constrained, either through support to local entrepreneurs, or through the provision of efficient insurance mechanisms so that differentiation is no longer perceived as a threat to the community. The encouraging observation is that elite capture and corruption do not appear to be constraining factors on performance. What organizations need to effectively make a difference in enhancing revenues for their members and their communities is greater access to professional capacity building and to financial resources. Only then will extensive presence of organizations translate into more than penny capitalism, and effectively support successful smallholder agricultural development and improved rural well being in West Africa.

Lack of product uniformity is perceived by consumers in West Africa to lead to longer cooking times and unpredictable preparation requirements, as the cleaning and sorting of this rice prior to cooking is thought to take longer and be more laborious. Credit arrangements also impact the choice of local versus imported rice: Traders in urban areas are reluctant to carry local rice because of lack of credit from wholesalers, whereas credit is generally available from importers and the wholesalers to whom they sell. Senegalese consumers, however, more than consumers in other West African countries show preferences for local, valued Senegal River Valley rice over imported rice due to its taste characteristics, even if impure and poorly sorted. Well-branded rice, designating place of origin, local fragrant rice, also received price premiums. (Diagne et al. 2017; Demont et al. 2012, Rutseart et al 2018) The investment of the government of Rwanda in good quality, but medium sized mills of 1-3 t/hr is proposed as a viable solution in West Africa, where rice may be milled more locally but also of better quality, to compete with imported rice. Fair prices paid to farmers needs to be an important part making such value chains work. In more isolated areas, small mills are seen as appropriate, giving ownership to the co-operatives and individual owners the sense that they are able to make productive investments that capture some of the value added in the commodity chain.

Millet is far more drought resistant that other major staples as rice and sorghum, a critical characteristic to rural communities where soil fertility is poor and rains are unpredictable. Millet is currently grown on about 1 million hectares or one-third of Senegal’s arable land. In the Senegalese regions of Kaolack, Kaffrine and Fatick, where most of the country’s millet and peanut are grown, typically on sandy soil. Millet is interchanged with peanuts from one year to the next, a vital relationship as peanuts help to fix nitrogen in the soil. (GAIN 2011) Import vs. domestic production issues from a civil society perspective: The rice sector in Senegal does not seem to benefit from a good image. Rice cultivation is perceived to be ''too expensive'' because it requires, in large part, irrigation by pumping and mechanized tillage. Equipment is deteriorating and the practice of renewing or repairing needed equipment is not yet welldeveloped. The price of rice produced domestically is even not competitive compared to imported rice.

Before the year 2000, the average yield in the SRV was around 4 tonnes ha –1 (SAED 2008). The ASI thresher is perceived by farmers as a moderately to highly time and labor saving technology with low to moderate grain recovery performance (Table 1). However, farmers were more concerned with the moderate grain quality achieved and the relatively modest number of machines available in the region. During the survey period, some 23–50% of farmers were not satisfied with the quality of private service operators and expressed the need for improving the performance of ASI threshing services. Therefore, for better rice quality and performance of the ASI, a thresher training program could be provided to operators to enable permanent adaptation/refinement of the machine.

The differences between both approaches indicate that farmers have a dichotomous view regarding bird damage related to risk perception: at low bird pressure (low perceived risk), they underestimate and at high bird pressure (high perceived risk) they overestimate true bird damage. Future research may further analyze the link between farmers' risk perception, risk attitude and bird control input use and also compare risk attitude with other DA inputs such as weed control. Both the DA approach and the questionnaire survey indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficiency of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate. This underlines the importance of local bird population reduction actions by the Senegalese government and investing research in practical, economical and environmentally friendly bird control techniques.

To insure a correct instruction of the multi-dimensional inquiry considering the limited resources, the diverse participants in the DIVA study have endeavored to multiply interactions and mediation to primarily establish links of confidence, to be able to reliably put into perspective the case-specific knowledge gained. So the clear political outcome of our study was that the vision of irrigated rice cultivation, initially designed to ‘valorize’ the Senegal Middle River valley potential, operated a ‘flood marginalization’ far from the vision of all local actors, whether male or female. In this regard, pollution and food problems have already been anticipated for almost 20 years by a committee of researchers and local actors in this area (Adams, 2000; Bruckmann, 2018). However, the public authorities and donors have not taken these warnings into account by adopting an economic development approach where the river is disconnected from its flood and ignoring food traditions, cultural and agri-food function of floods. Our results, deeply locally situated, show the growing negative impacts on the expansion of irrigated intensive rice cultivation on biodiversity, traditional knowledge and nutrition. The ethical dimension of the TD and gendered DIVA study, despite its geographical limitations, consisted in giving value to the heritage and memory of local actors in their quest for food and cultural sovereignty. Women farmers of diverse status have expressed this attachment while at the same time stressing their concern for the disappearance of cultural, agriculture and food habits.

The results are summarized in table 3 below. Components most appealing to farmers were: fertilizer and weed management, use of improved varieties and harvesting/post harvest technologies. In general, farmers attributed the superior performance of RICM to management factors. Application of urea in three splits is perceived to have a yield increasing effect, while use of basal phosphorus is perceived to affect high tillering and yield. The perceived positive attribute of herbicide use is its labor saving effect. However, only half of the respondents plan to use herbicides for weed control, citing the high cost of herbicides as the main reason. Farmers also indicated that where labor is not a major constraint in the household, the need for chemical weed control is minimal. Respondents also consider the higher grain quality and good taste of the improved variety Sahel 202 as important, but cited problems of seed availability as a constraint to potential use. Most farmers indicated they would reduce seeding rates to appropriate levels only when certified seed is available.

This bold initiative is notable for omitting a meaningful role for the domestic private sector, which has advanced considerably since structural adjustment in the mid-1990s. Commercial investment would accelerate and sustain the productivity advancements pursued by GOANA, and private-sector innovation would continue driving future growth. USAID should initiate dialogue with its GoS counterparts to define a clearer priority and role for the private sector in Senegal’s agricultural policies. While USAID’s implementing partners have an important role to play in supporting this dialogue (for instance in helping to bring the private sector’s voice to the table, generating evidence-based policy analysis, and implementing any recommendations), it is important for the US government to establish and maintain direct relationships with key GoS stakeholders.

First, high prices were a major driver, because of both higher international prices and GOS efforts to incentivize farmers through price, import, and export controls. Second, subsidies on everything from inputs to machinery boosted profits for most farmers, at least those with the means or access to finance to afford those inputs and services. Third, successful experience with contre saison yields led to a steady switch to that season and some double cropping, and reinforced the possibility of increased yields and higher quality. Finally, many farmers interviewed expressed that they saw increasing yield and production as their patriotic duty, and are making efforts to support the GOS self-sufficiency policy. The favorable policy environment has reassured both farmers and private investors in the rice value chain that there is a “guaranteed” market for domestic rice (i.e., that there will be ongoing political and financial support). This has substantially reduced the risk perceived by investors, and, for that matter, donors, as well as lengthening the time horizon for investment.

Policy makers focused less on social or cultural aspects of food habits, such as practices, perceptions, and community participation or empowerment. Items that related to postharvest handling, storage, and marketing of agricultural produce were less frequently included in the policy documents. In particular, activities to expand market access of nutrient-rich foods were absent from the food security policies reviewed. The respondents noted that the current agricultural programs in which they were involved had no explicit nutritional goals and as such did not include nutritional indicators. Yet, the reduction of postharvest losses, organization of nutrition education and promotion, improvement of storage, and expansion of markets and market access are areas that offer considerable scope for improvement and explicit focus in policies.

Water supply for rice comes from rivers and streams; irrigation flows through the same ancient river ways. Flooded fields provide an environment that controls weeds, but the water is not then entirely used or transpired by the rice crop, nor is it all evaporated.

Rice Weed Management in Rice-Based Cropping Systems in Africa 189 farmers in Africa do however indicate that herbicides have become less effective against certain species. For instance, propanil has been observed to be less effective to control E. colona in Senegal than in the past (Haefele et al., 2000). A survey of rice farms in Benin in 2006 revealed disadoption of a once popular herbicide (Garil, a mix of propanil and triclopyr) as it became less efficient (Kouazounde, 2006). Further investigation indicated that the herbicide had become ineffective againstD. horizontalis perhaps as a result of propanil resistance. Resistance may be accelerated by the continuous use of a single product which in turn can be a consequence of the limited range of products available on the local market; a common constraint to small farmers in Africa.

Sahel-108 is known as a relatively weak weed competitor (Haefele et al., 2004a) while Sahel 202 was recently identified as a relatively strong weed competitor (Krupnik et al., 2012). Rice was sown directly by broad casting (2009) and in lines at 20 20 cm (2010 and 2011). Recommended water management and fertilizer applications were followed. The 2010 and 2011 experiments were carried out on the same field, about 150 m from the field where the experiment of 2009 was executed.

The former is an Entisol, a tropical soil with high iron content and low organic matter. The second is an Alfisol, which is more weathered and has higher clay, silt, and organic matter content. Local farming systems include a mix of compound and bush fields cultivated by rural households. Compound fields surround homesteads, are cultivated permanently, receive various amounts of amendments from rubbish heaps or livestock pens, and are typically planted with cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees. Bush fields are located at some distance from homesteads (ranging from 0.5 km to a few kilometers), and may be differentiated into upland or lowland fields, suitable to a variety of crops, such as millet, maize, groundnut or maize. They receive less input than the compound fields. In both communities, the main crops are millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Farmers in Bacfassagal also produce sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which are often intercropped with millet or peanut. In Paoskoto, wetter conditions allow farmers to produce maize, especially early-maturing varieties (the most popular one is an 80-day variety known as Early Thai). Rainfed rice (Oryza sativa) is also cultivated in valley bottoms and some farmers grow water melon and pumpkin in compound plots. In both communities, farmers usually plant millet prior to the rain, applying varying amounts of organic manure and, sometimes, chemical fertilizers. Peanut and maize are generally sown after a few big rains when farmers believe that the rainy season has really started. In Paoskoto, farmers tend to use fertilizers and pesticides on peanut and maize, though they mentioned the high price of chemical inputs as a constraint.

In upland fields in Cote d'Ivoire, O. glaberrima varieties IG10 (Fofana and Rauber, 2000), CG14, and CG20 ( Jones et al., 1996) were found to be superior in suppressing weeds but also had low yield potential. On hydromorphic soils in Nigeria, the tall variety OS6, incurred 24% less yield reductions from weed competition than the semidwarf cultivar ANDNY11 (Akobundu and Ahissou, 1985). In Senegal, Haefele et al. (2004) reported that lowland rice variety Jaya was weed competitive and high yielding compared to a range of varieties. Jaya incurred lower yield losses due to weeds (<20%) compared to popular Sahel 108 (>40%). Superior performance of Jaya under both weedy and weed-free conditions 176 J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson was confirmed in a study carried out in Benin (Rodenburg et al., 2009). This study also identified nine superior lowland NERICA varieties as noted above. Table 6 lists some O. glaberrima, O. sativa, and interspecific rice varieties that have shown to be weed competitive in Africa. Varieties with superior levels of weed competitiveness have been confirmed in other regions, such as Apo and UPLRi-7 in Asia (Zhao et al., 2006a; 2007), Oryzica Sabana 6 in Latin America (Fischer et al., 2001), and M-202 in north America (Gibson et al., 2001), and these could be tested under African rice production conditions in the future.

Herbicide use in rice in Africa is poorly documented and recent publications covering currently used products are not available. Herbicides targeting broad-leaved weed species in rice in Africa are 2,4-D and MCPA, while, butachlor, molinate, oxadiazon, and thiobencarb are commonly used against grass weeds ( Johnson, 1997; Rao et al., 2007). Glyphosate, a herbicide used in land preparation for rice, is effective against O. longistaminata and O. barthii as preemergence treatment (Davies, 1984; Riches et al., 2005). Propanil is a popular herbicide for use in tank mixtures and, for example, one of the most frequently used combinations in rice production schemes of the Senegal River Valley is propanil and 2,4-D + dichlorprop (e.g., Haefele et al., 2000). Postemergence applications of propanil mixed with piperophos (Imeokparia, 1994), molinate (Babiker, 1982), thiobencarb, fluorodifen, or oxadiazon (Akobundu, 1981; Okafor, 1986) proved successful in irrigated rice in various other African countries. In irrigated direct-seeded rice, good weed control was obtainedwith preemergence applications of dymrone or thiobencarb in the Lake Chad Basin in Nigeria (Okafor, 1986), and bifenox or oxadiazon in Sudan (Babiker, 1982). In upland rice in Nigeria, good weed control has been reported by using mixtures of pretilachor with dimethametryne and piperophos with cinosulfuron (Enyinnia, 1992; Ishaya et al., 2007). Chemical weed control is best used in conjunctions with other weedmanagement components within an IWM approach (Rijn, 2001). In this respect, however, herbicides may not lend themselves to be combined with other practices such as mixed cropping systems (Akobundu and Fagade, 1978) or biological pest control (e.g., Afun et al., 1999b; Taylor et al., 2006).

This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers' claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers' yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year. While this approach has obvious limitations, it nonetheless provided an estimate of potential impact of forecast use relative to a wide range of cropping practices and rainfall conditions.

This shows that the farmers of the two sites (Ndiaye and Fanaye) are interested in these two types of lines especially intra-specific lines, including those from the series of WAS173, who presented the best average grain yields. The duration sowing maturity seems to be variously appreciated by sites. The farmers of the site Ndiaye, have far more privileged earliness while those of Fanaye area, chose the varieties with average cycle or a long cycle. Discussions with farmers highlighted a preference for early cycles in the delta (Ndiaye) unlike the peasants of the Middle Valley (Fanaye), which seem to opt for medium or long cycles. The Delta area is characterized by salinity of soil and seasonal temperature drops. Early varieties allow them to harvest before the November drops in temperature that reduce overwintering crop yields for longer cycles, and also to practice double cropping rice / rice. Precocity is also an advantage during the semi belated, hence their preference for short cycle varieties. At Fanaye farmers prefer rather varieties with a medium or long cycle, which they consider more profitable because of better grain filling unlike the short-season varieties, which are characterized in this site by poor filling seeds.

Women listed varieties of squash and pumpkin (called Dene Boude) with yellow flesh (called Diayedje), maize, cornilla (called niebe), and black rice (called Sarna or Maro Balleo, which was cultivated before the Nerica rice), wild grasses with small edible seeds (known locally as Pagguri, locally considered similar to fonio), fruit of the water lily, seeds of Nymphea lotus (called locally Ndayri), or bulb of Gladiolus sp. (Iridaceae locally called Dayeedji). However, the consumption of the previously mentioned species has decreased although some of them are still much appreciated foods, especially for their seeds (called Pode); they are available in the market. One woman explained: 'The disappearing crops means that people stop eating these foods. Because if you donot grow them anymore, you have to buy them, so you donot prefer to buy them, because before you could get them for free, apart from the trouble of growing them'. Pode was one of the plants and associated dishes constantly evoked and considered as a culinary loss while it was alive in people's memories. Cooking it is always a celebration: the choice to live in the villages, and sometimes in the concessions, made it possible to ask the families to cook the pode for us. This was an opportunity to measure the emotion involved in making this dish. Wild bush fruits such as jujub (desert date palm (Balanites aegyptica)) and Fulani ngigili (Boscia Senegalensis) have also become rare. The Kelly (Zizyphus Mauritania), a bush fruit resembling the jujub has completely disappeared (according to fieldwork, see also Boetsch et al., 2012).

Farmers also tend to prefer older seedlings, and consider them better adapted to agronomic stresses. For example, several participating farmers experienced problems with seedling mortality in SRI, which necessitated post-transplant gap filling. Poor land leveling is common in the study region, and farmers experienced failed crop establishment in field depressions where single, young SRI seedlings became submerged and/or washed away during the first irrigation, supporting Senthilkumar et al. (2008) and Tsujimoto et al. (2009), who observed similar problems in India and Madagascar, respectively. Several SRI studies have also examined the effect of seedling number and transplanting age on yield (e.g., Latif et al., 2009; Tsujimoto et al., 2009), though the advantages of either practice remain inconclusive. We therefore suggest that it is best to adopt a flexible approach to transplanting practices, only using single, young seedlings in low-risk environments where farmers are certain of their ability to minimize constraining agronomic and social factors.

The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).	Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley	J.C.

Usually, the farmer organization will apply for a collective loan from the bank. The organization's president will then purchase the inputs depending on the needs of the members and redistribute them to every member. The farmer organization is collectively responsible for the loan and has to cover any individual default. The presence of the bank, which is necessary for most farmers, nevertheless generates negative externalities by reducing farmers' leeway. Indeed, farmers chose to produce tomatoes, as they are more likely to obtain a loan thanks to the presence of the marketing company Senegalese Canned Food Company (SOCAS), which ensures a stable and easily accessible outlet of production. This company collects the harvest and 1 A household is defined as ``a group of individuals who live and work on plot together, prepare meals together for home consumption and pool resources in order to provide for their essential needs''. The members of the household recognize the authority of the head of the household. This definition corresponds to the notion of ``Njel'' in Wolof or ``Hirande'' in Foula, both notions includes the idea that the household is a consumption-production group. pays the farmer's organization at a fixed price of 55FCFA per kilo (0.11USD). This price is, however, well below the market price of 150FCFA. Additionally, this company has been criticized of deliberately collecting the harvest late so that the tomatoes have started losing water and weight - the appearance of the tomatoes being less of an issue for canning purposes. Farmers would therefore prefer to cultivate other crops, such as onion, which would be easier to grow, require less inputs and are easier to store than tomatoes. However, as there is no guaranteed outlet for other produces, farmers not supplying the SOCAS would not be eligible for loans from the CNCAS bank.

This selection on certain criteria risks fueling a dynamic including the wealthiest producers and excluding the less endowed, thus generating a poverty trap. Some papers highlight a sequential model of small farmer participation in contract farming (Barrett et al., 2012; Reardon et al., 2009) that I describe further.

First of all, as documented earlier, urban consumers prefer broken rice, sorted into categories of homogenous size and they value the cleanness and visual presentation of rice (Fall et al., 2007; Demont et al., forthcoming). In contrast, most of the local paddy rice is only transformed into milled rice at a small informal mill, but not cleaned and sorted (which rural women usually do at home) and it involves mainly intermediary and whole grain rice. Although studies show that urban consumers are willing to pay a higher price for good quality local rice, consumers in Dakar generally believe that local rice is of inferior quality (Fall et al., 2007). There clearly is a mismatch between the product demanded by the majority of Senegalese consumers and the product characteristics of domestic rice that is supplied to them.

Before liberalization the GoS shouldered all production and marketing risk, and there as a general expectation that private-sector intermediaries should play the same role. Most producers are not commercially oriented and prefer to make small, intermittent sales to mitigate household risk and smooth consumption. Such transactions significantly constrain processors needing larger supplies. Even if rice traders or mills had sufficient working capital to purchase large quantities of paddy post-harvest, they would find it difficult to find farmers willing to sell in bulk. The more commercially-oriented private producers sell a higher-proportion of their harvest but cultivate smaller plots resulting in lower volumes.

Both rice millers and farmers can initiate the contract. They share relational proximity because the managers originate from the village and hire local workers. The contract is a written one, and includes the amount of inputs the miller provides to farmers: seed, fertilizers, herbicides and/or mechanized services. The miller may also implement the technical support and have the power of decision over irrigation and harvest. The quality of paddy required is the same as in a marketing contract. The miller does not have to pay producers because 100% of producer organizations participating in production contracts supply no more than the quantity of paddy equal to the value of the credit. Rice millers prefer contracting with farmers who cultivate large areas but also resort to producer organizations. They do not finance investments by the producers, who consequently must have prepared irrigated land. The millers reported a collection radius of 50 kilometres. When there is a conflict, producers and the miller renegotiate. In 2014, production contracts were used to market 15,000 tons of paddy by 71 producer organizations grouping 1,500 producers who grew rice on 3,500 ha.

Millers claimed to select producers mainly based on observable characteristics. The distance between the farm and the miller determines participation in contracts because the millers' collection radius is around 50 km. Moreover, the volume of supplies available from farmers matters for contracting companies (Barrett et al., 2012). Rice millers in Dagana departement claimed to select producers and producer organizations on the basis of the irrigated area they farm. In this paper, we use the number of members of the producer organization as a proxy for the surface area farmed by the producer organization because part of the data about the surface area was missing. Contracting companies also select farms based on non-land assets (Reardon et al., 2009). Some millers stated that they prefer to purchase paddy from the wealthiest households with the highest number of active members and the most experience. A previous study of French beans in Senegal also identified the fact that ethnicity influenced participation in contracts (Maertens and Swinnen, 2009). One of the millers' selection criteria less frequently cited in the literature is farmers' access to warehouses, as it enables better control of the moisture rate. Nevertheless, millers reported that recent increases in the regional milling capacity and competition with traditional processors caused them to be less exacting with regard to these characteristics.

Indeed, it is not an indicator of farm isolation, which could influence farmers’ access to inputs, advisory centers, paddy markets or food markets, or an indicator of differences between agro-ecological areas. As shown in Fig. 2, there are two tarmacked roads in the département, and the distance to these roads is the main indicator of farm isolation rather than the distance between farms and rice millers offering production contracts. These millers are located in the North, around the city of Rosso-Senegal. As a result, some farms located a certain distance from these rice millers are close to tarmacked roads while others located the same distance from the rice millers can be found much further from tarmacked roads.

This is a gregarious, granivorous bird adapted to semi-arid habitats (typically Acacia savannas of SSA) (Elliott, 2006). They typically gather in large flocks (up to several million) and breed in colonies covering vast areas (sometimes > 100 ha, with about 30,000 nests per hectare). The species Q. quelea primarily feeds on seeds of cereal crops, grasses in field margins and weedy crop fields but also on insects (Elliott, 1979). They prefer seeds of grasses in general and that of Echinochloa spp. in particular. Most noxious weeds in irrigated rice in the Sahel are the grasses Oryza barthii A. Chev. and Oryza longistaminata A. Chev. & Roehr (Wild Rice), Echinochloa Colona (L.) link, Ischaemum Rugosum Salisb. and Leersia Hexandra SW., The Sedges Cyperus Difformis L., Cyperus Esculentus L., Schoenoplectus Senegalensis (S.) Raynal, and Bolboschoenus Maritimus (L.) Palla (syn. Scirpus Maritimus L.) and the broad-leaved Sphenoclea Zeylanica Gaertner, Ludwigia Erecta (L.) H. Hara, Ludwigia Hyssopifolia (G. Don) Exell, Eclipta Prostrata (L.) L. andAmmania auriculataWilld. (e.g. Diallo and Johnson,1997; Johnson et Al., 2004; Krupnik et Al., 2012). In the SRV most farmers rely on chemical weed control, using a combination of propanil and 2,4-D, followed by hand weeding (e.g. Haefele et al., 2002a). Against birds, seasonal chemical control is often routinely executed by the Senegalese Crop Protection Directorate near important bird roosts. This involves the use of large quantities of non-selective avicides, often organophosphate insecticides like cyanophos and fenthion, that are toxic to many bird species, including non-seed eaters, as well as reptile and fish species, posing serious environmental hazards (Mulli e et al., 1999; McWilliam and Cheke, 2004; Cheke et al., 2012, 2013). Alternative methods include the use of bird repellents, based on chemicals or natural plant extracts (Averyet al.,1996; AveryandMason,1997;Averyet al., 1998, 2005; Werner et al., 2005), repellents based on sound or by netting the crop and by better crop sowing timing and synchronization (Elliott, 1979; Treca, 1985).

Thus large mills could cover around half of the processing, although in reality they are covering somewhere between one-eighth and one-quarter as farmers continue to prefer working with the small décortiqueses. Faced with excess capacity, most larger mills both started to grow their own rice and also directly contracted with farmers, in some cases supplying inputs in advance. For example, one mill in Caoumba produces 1,000 ha of its own rice and finances a network of 13,000 farmers producing on 7,000 ha. Nonetheless, it appears that many farmers still find it more profitable or preferable to use local décortiqueses, possibly because transport and storage costs are lower or because they can process rice in small batches as they need income over the course of the year.

Farmer organizations usually only oversee the demand for credit and the distribution of inputs and irrigation water. Without personal funds or individual access to credit, it is necessary to be part of a farmer organization in order to be able to cultivate a significant area. Through facilitating access to credit and inputs, and thereby increasing production, union membership can enhance individual market participation, even when the farmer organizations usually do not arrange for the commercialization of surplus production. The main reason for the limited commercial activity of farmer organizations is the heterogeneity of producers. While some farmers are in urgent need of cash at the end of the season and prefer to sell the paddy rice immediately after (or even before) harvesting, others have the option to postpone sales and transform the paddy into sorted rice themselves and store it for a higher price season. The credit provided to farmer organizations can only be used for the purchase of seeds and inputs. Farmer organizations do not negotiate marketing credit which would allow them to collect, transform and store all surplus rice production and advance some of the total sales revenue to farmers. Moreover, farmer organizations often lack the management and marketing skills to perform these tasks.

Probably far more than any other crop, rice can grow under diverse geographical, climatic and cultural conditions. The quality preferences of rice consumers, over millennia, have resulted in a wide diversity of varieties specific to different localities. Rice has a unique center of origin in West Africa, for the African rice species (Oryza glabberrima). According to Cubry et al (2018), the Oryza glabberrima was domesticated in the inner Niger Delta. This Africa rice species has been partly replaced by higheryielding Asian rice, but it nonetheless persists, particularly in upland environments. African rice is hardy and pest-resistant crop, well adapted to a variety of African conditions (Linares 2002) and often preferred for its nutty taste. African rice holds unique cultural values; for instance, it is sacred to the Jola people in the Casamance region of Senegal5, and is a heritage variety in the United States, having been brought to the New World by slaves (Carney 2009). The genetic traits of African rice have been used in breeding programs to develop NERICA, the ``New Rice for Africa'' (Sarla et al. 2005).

However as there was no system of seed certification in place, farmers used either saved seed of those varieties or seed produced by seed multipliers of often low quality. Most rice was grown only in one season, the rainy season (hivernale), even though yields were lower than in the dry, hot season (principally because of lower costs as less irrigation is needed). Machinery services for land preparation and harvesting were well established in that most farmers were aware of them, though for the majority of farmers actual use of mechanical services was minimal due to limited availability, high costs, and lack of credit.

The other varieties are still available locally, preserved by some families and sold in the bush markets; they are still present, too, in culinary memories. The women were able to accurately describe the characteristics of the grain and flour, the related agricultural practices (e.g. crop cycle, seasonality), the interests and disadvantages of cultivating the variety, and the management of seeds. This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women. All these varieties were local or peasant. A summarized description of the 8 most cited recession sorghum varieties and photographs can be found in Tables S1 and Fig. S3 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material. Briefly, the 3 most frequently cited varieties were Poordi (which means brown, the color of the seed), Mariam Sowdou (from the name of the woman who introduced and spread it) and Balieri (which means white). Yellow variety (Paaca) was also mentioned. The choice of cultivating one or another variety was guided by the length of the crop cycle (e.g. the Poordi cycle was 20 days shorter than the Balieri cycle) and bird attacks (e.g. the Balieri was less sensitive compared to Poordi). As a result, the Poordi variety was the most cultivated while its bitter taste (a protective factor against bird attacks) was less and less appreciated by the families. Among the 19 other varieties mentioned, the cultivation of most of them has been abandoned due to longer cycles (e.g. Bobo Jamm and Samba Souke). In addition, the decrease in flooding for several consecutive years has had consequences for the seed conservation of these different varieties. Because the maximum storage time is two years according to women involved in sorghum breeding, and because of the uncertainty of the next floods, women progressively stopped keeping seeds and preferred to buy them at the market or from neighbors. Nevertheless, some women did their best to save sorghum seeds.	Expanding and intensifying rice production consequences on agrobiodiversity management and diet quality.

This study adopts the traditional Cobb-Douglas (CD) specification however due to its ease of estimation and because flexible forms require many observations due to the large amount of model parameters, which reduces the degrees of freedom of the model substantially. Due to the panel structure of the dataset, fixed farm and time effects were included in the production function; their inclusion was concluded to be essential by Carpentier and Weaver (1997). The mathematical specification of the loglinear form of the production function is: ln ln    ln (1) where α, βi, fk and tm are parameters to be estimated. The arguments Xi are the productive inputs, with i = 1 (land), 2 (seed), 3 (labor), 4 (fertilizer), 5 (irrigation costs).

Early weed infestation was low and farmers refrained from herbicide use. In spite of its efficiency on early weed control and its low cost (fuel consumption was about 1 000 liters for pre-flooding, corresponding to 66 000 UM; see Tab.

Globally, in irrigated plots of the Waalo, under the responsibility of the men, almost exclusively owners of the land, the women were carrying out different strategic tasks (transplanting, weeding, guarding the cultivation against birds, harvesting) for the production of rice, onions and tomatoes. The new agro-system organization has created a novel female status, that of the ‘woman who helps’, which means she loses all family and social recognition. Even when migration kept young men absent and women were involved in many tasks, they very rarely gained recognition with strategic bodies (Top, 2014). When the lack of manpower made it necessary to make choices between crops in the irrigated Waalo or flood basins, the family choice gave priority to irrigated plots and rice that became strategic for the families’ food security and for earning money. The Waalo has thus lost its place as a feeding ground to irrigated areas, and to rice, which is now the staple food of the peasants. Sorghum, on the other hand, was becoming a cash crop for some families, who preferred to sell it when they grew it because: ‘The 50 kg bag is worth 30,000 FCFA for sorghum against 15,000 FCFA for rice.

Moreover, we hypothesize that the ``Degree of farm specialization'' variable captures information about how diversification could influence farmers' food insecurity, because the main non-rice crop in the study area is tomato, which is mainly marketed (Fall et al., 2010). Furthermore, households headed by women and elderly people seemed to have less information about contracts, preferring spot transactions. More dependent households might also display a weaker performance. In contrast, ownership of a vehicle seems to improve farmers' connections with rice millers``.

Under experimental conditions, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to pay an 18 percent price premium for imported Thai 100 percent broken rice relative to conventional, ungraded SRV rice. However, they were willing to pay an even larger price premium, 35 percent, to obtain enhanced-quality SRV broken rice. Conventional, ungraded SRV rice is a mix of varieties, has a mediocre grain quality, and is commonly available on the market. Imported Thai 100 percent broken rice has a grain quality somewhere between the conventional and the enhanced-quality SRV broken rice and contains some impurities. Enhanced quality SRV broken rice is purified and homogenized through one or two sifting operations. On top of the price premium of 35 percent for enhanced quality SRV broken rice, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to add another 6 percent for a branded rice product, paying an overall price premium of 41 percent for PINORD's Rival(R) (see Box 1) relative to conventional SRV rice. These findings suggest that Senegalese consumers are willing to pay for intrinsic food quality attributes and that SRV rice is able to compete against imported rice if post-harvest quality is tailored to consumer preferences. 11 But also breeding currently plays a role in tailoring quality to urban consumer preferences. In 2011, three fragrant rice varieties bred by AfricaRice (Sahel 177, 328 and 329) have been introduced in the SRV. Given that an important market segment of urban consumers (particularly in Dakar) prefers imported fragrant rice, this introduction opens the door for the development of domestic value chains of fragrant rice and further replacing imports with domestic rice. 11 Enhancing quality in the context of a food insecure country may seem counterintuitive at first, but is consistent with similar findings in Asia revealing that even the very poor have more income elastic demand for food quality than for food quantity (Shah, 1983).

TEEB presents an approach that can help decision-makers recognize, demonstrate and capture the values of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Within the global initiative, studies have been undertaken to investigate the application of the concept to different sectors. The ‘TEEB for Agriculture and Food’ (TEEBAgriFood2) study seeks to review the economic interdependencies between human (economic and social) systems, agriculture and food systems, and biodiversity and ecosystems. In doing so, it addresses the economic invisibility of many of these links while exploring how biodiversity and key ecosystem services deliver benefits to the agriculture sector and also beyond, itself being a key contributor to human health, livelihoods and well-being.

This led the total cultivated area, as reported in the official statistics, to increase from 27,792 ha in 2006-2007 to between 50,000 and 60,000 ha in 2008-2010. Of the increase of approximately 30,000 ha over that period, around twothirds were in saison chaud. The increase in area cultivated during the saison chaud allowed farmers and institutions like SAED to recognize more broadly what had long been true, namely that yields in the saison chaud were much greater than in hivernale, 1.25 to 1.65 mt/ha higher on average. Despite the higher costs of production, especially energy to run irrigation pumps, rice production in saison chaud turned out to be more productive and profitable. By 2009-2010 the share of saison chaud in total production had risen from 15 percent to between 35 and 45 percent, depending on the year. This was the state of play at the beginning of the scaling efforts led by PCE that started in 2010.

Usually, the farmer organization will apply for a collective loan from the bank. The organization's president will then purchase the inputs depending on the needs of the members and redistribute them to every member. The farmer organization is collectively responsible for the loan and has to cover any individual default. The presence of the bank, which is necessary for most farmers, nevertheless generates negative externalities by reducing farmers' leeway. Indeed, farmers chose to produce tomatoes, as they are more likely to obtain a loan thanks to the presence of the marketing company Senegalese Canned Food Company (SOCAS), which ensures a stable and easily accessible outlet of production. This company collects the harvest and 1 A household is defined as ``a group of individuals who live and work on plot together, prepare meals together for home consumption and pool resources in order to provide for their essential needs''. The members of the household recognize the authority of the head of the household. This definition corresponds to the notion of ``Njel'' in Wolof or ``Hirande'' in Foula, both notions includes the idea that the household is a consumption-production group. pays the farmer's organization at a fixed price of 55FCFA per kilo (0.11USD). This price is, however, well below the market price of 150FCFA. Additionally, this company has been criticized of deliberately collecting the harvest late so that the tomatoes have started losing water and weight - the appearance of the tomatoes being less of an issue for canning purposes. Farmers would therefore prefer to cultivate other crops, such as onion, which would be easier to grow, require less inputs and are easier to store than tomatoes. However, as there is no guaranteed outlet for other produces, farmers not supplying the SOCAS would not be eligible for loans from the CNCAS bank.

It has also been demonstrated however that, for example, Echinochloa sp. responded more to fertilizer than the rice (Gibson et al., 1999). Timing of fertilizer application may be very important with respect to its influence on the outcome of competition. Early fertilizer applications stimulate weed growth especially of weeds with small seed sizes that have little reserves (Liebman and Davis, 2000). In upland rice in the forest zone of West Africa, N application tended to increase weed growth and only benefited yields when it was accompanied by improved weed control (Becker and Johnson, 2001a). While farmers commonly recognize the importance of combining improved weed management with fertilizer applications, data from Africa on the impact of improved rice crop nutrition on competition with weeds are very limited.

Scaling up in the upper parts of the SRV will be more challenging as the existing irrigation infrastructure and value chains are much less dense. The land is less suitable for rice versus much more profitable horticulture crops like tomatoes and onions. Perhaps more importantly, crop insurance has not yet been shown to work and still needs to be tweaked, a major challenge throughout the SRV.

However, in recent years, the consumption of rice has rapidly increased. Particularly, in West African countries, annual rice consumption per capita has tripled over the past 40 years (Africa Rice Center, 2005). This increase, observed in the urban areas, is perhaps because rice requires a shorter time to cook than other cereals (Hiraoka, 2017). In West African countries, where economic development is expected to accelerate in the future, urbanization is expected to be promoted partly by increasing rice consumption (Tsuboi et al., 2008). However, the domestic production of rice remains low, as evidenced by the 2.5 [t/ha] of land-based rice productivity in West Africa in 2005 (Africa Rice Center, 2007). According to Figure 1, recently, consumption has significantly exceeded production. To meet the increasing demand for rice, 6 million tons of rice are imported every year (Stryker, 2013). In 2008, when the food crisis occurred, a significant number of West African countries experienced starvation due to steep increases in the price of imported rice. In terms of food security, the governments of these countries have adopted certain agricultural policies and projects to strengthen the rice production sector (Dupraz et al., 2013).

Reducing dependence on rice import and achieving national food security will certainly require supportive measures that can lead to the creation of opportunities for rice production, e.g., improving rice production through irrigation systems, ensuring a stable supply of input goods, stabilizing producer prices, and providing agricultural credit.

In Table 5, we explore the correlations that exist between the extent of bureaucracy characterized in Table 4 and the performance of the organization. Performance is measured as the proportion of members that are said to have benefited at least once from the organization. Due to important colinearity between the variables presented in Table 4, we regroup four of these variables into two: a ''control'' variable which is equal to one if the organization has a control commission or a written code of conduct, zero otherwise; and a ''professional management'' variable which is equal to one if the organization maintains either an accounting or registry book, zero otherwise.

Market-gardening is one of the ways in which African farmers intensify production. Numerous studies have demonstrated how men and women living in peri-urban zones, in the proximity of large markets and labor pools, have become engaged in producing and selling garden vegetables during the dry season (9–13). These endeavors contribute to dry season income, and hence to food security, and also strengthen gender and occupational identity (12). They also encourage cooperation between urban inhabitants belonging to various ethnic groups, and contribute to urban bio-diversity (9). In some localities, it is only men and boys who do the gardening (11), whereas in others women have become vegetable wholesalers (12). Overall, however, women are not as involved as men in urban and peri-urban farming because they lack land and cash to invest (13).

To exemplify this , one of the female farmers from one of the oral history group interviews said the following .	said	history group interviews said the following.	n	The results from both female group-, male individualand key informant interviews revealed that household’s agricultural plots had become individually instead managed of collectively. During the preceding generation, all household members worked on the family plot, resulting in one shared income, which was managed by the husband. This type of management is called the ‘co-operative model’ since resources are pooled, and harvests are shared instead of splitting up into several units amongst the family members. Today, the household’s husband and wife manage and cultivate their own plots individually. This type of management is called the ‘non-cooperative model’ since resources are not shared amongst family members, and the husband and the wife work separately on their respective fields which is their own responsibility (Quisumbing et al. 2014; Croppenstedth et al. 2013; Udry et al. 1995; Udry, 1996; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Diiro et al. 2018). Recalling Section 3.2. in the literature review, the preceding generation’s agricultural management fit into the tenant of ‘Pareto efficiency.’ This assumes that farming households would share the factors of production in an equal distribution (the co-operative model), making it more likely to maximize agricultural efficiency. In the current individualized management system, this is not the case. To exemplify this, one of the female farmers from one of the oral history group interviews said the following. “The husbands give nothing to their wives. The wives do not even know how much rice their husbands are harvesting and what they do with their revenues. The husbands only “give” to their wives during the night.” (Female farmer from Oral history group interview no. 2, in Ross Bethio) 6.3.1 Domain 2Ownership or renting of resources The thesis has observed both similarities and differences in genders ownership or renting of productive factors such as land and resources, over the last 10 years and preceding generation.

Contrasting the appropriation of benefits between leaders and non-leaders shows the remarkable ability of bureaucratic procedures in holding in check potential abuse of leadership. Leaders do not derive differential benefits from MOs compared to other members. In COs, we see that leaders derive less benefits than other members in Senegal. While there may be a bias in reporting, we were frequently told in case studies that leaders are cautious in not being served first not to jeopardize their leadership positions. The observed differences within COs in Table 9 may then be attributed to different mix of poverty levels across organizations. Systematically associating resource management by local organizations with elite capture, as done in much of the literature on decentralization and participation, can be quite misleading. Here, the issue is less capture and corruption than low management capacity and lack of access to resources.	Do Village Organizations Make a Difference in African Rural Development?

In addition to producing paddy rice, CASL will also buy it from local farmers and employ local people to operate and maintain the large farm and rice mill. The scheme is ambitious and there are challenges. Rice plants are living things, and this is not like producing a good in a factory. “We are subject to the wind and the rain,” says CASL CEO Laurent Nicolas. “You could say that in our case the factory has no roof and no walls.

Part of our emphasis on SRI and ecologically based agricultural techniques in comes from a wider effort by the Programme GIPD to use low external-input agricultural techniques as a practical means to tackle increasing water quality problems (insecticide and herbicide contamination) resulting from intensive cropping in the Senegal and Niger River Basins. This offers us a unique opportunity to study adoption and innovation (adaptation) pathways of the system with farmers that have been exposed to and that have experimented with SRI. The major accomplishment of this years’ work has been the implementation of three carefully controlled experimental trials on research stations (one replicated both 36 and 149 km inland from the mouth of the Senegal River, at the WARDA Sahel Stations at N’Diaye and Fanaye, respectively) to examine SRI compared to conventional cropping systems. Another success has been the installation of side by side cropping system comparison trials in 12 farmers’ fields in the Podor region. Unfortunately, we are not yet at liberty to provide data or results from our efforts at this early stage. While the performance of SRI has been encouraging to date in our research station experiments, we have yet to harvest the first of our on-farm cropping systems trials to better judge how the system functions under producer rather than researcher management.

This empirical framework combines two potential characteristics of the interactions between farmers' decisions to apply and eventually obtain credit and the associated productivity outcome, namely, endogeneity of and self-selectivity (Maddala and Nelson 1975). In effect, it is assumed that some unobserved characteristics may well affect both the probability of being credit-constrained and productivity (say, a weather shock that tends to simultaneously reduce performance and reduce farmers' credit-worthiness). In addition, the prospects of gaining from credit in terms of increased capacity and performance could well be a driver to farmers' likelihood to enter the market and seek credit. Neglecting these issues, as a regular Ordinarily Least Squares (OLS) estimation would do, could lead to biased and inconsistent estimates. The model is used by many to address similar issues, such as Ali, Deininger, and Duponchel (2014) and Awotide et al. (2015) who looked at the impact of access to credit on the farm performance, as well as Seck (2017) who looked at the impact of fertilizer subsidy on farmers' performance in the same agro-ecological region of the Senegal River Valley (with the same dataset used here).

One of Naatal Mbay’s larger partners in the region is Maka Diama, a farmer network representing some 416 smallholders with approximately 400 hectares under cultivation. “Before working with Naatal Mbay, the farmers were producing about 4 tons of rice per hectare,” says Assane Diop, the network’s president. “Now, with higher quality fertilizer and certified seeds, it’s almost twice that amount.” Diop adds that the increased production owes in part to new GPS-enabled devices and training on their use. The devices, part of a suite of easy-to-use digital tools made available by Naatal Mbay, have helped farmers make precise measurements of their fields and, thus, more accurate estimates of the amount of seed and fertilizer needed for planting.

With their crop as their only collateral, smallholder farmers struggled to attract financing from banks wary of taking on the risk. A vicious cycle ensued; credit-strained farmers produced lower yields, leaving them with insufficient income to purchase the premium-quality seeds and fertilizer needed to turn a profit. As a result, many farmers and millers defaulted on their loans, further eroding banks’ faith in rice as a safe investment.	Senegal’s Rice Revolution	Anne Yeager Sallah	2020

In addition to producing paddy rice, CASL will also buy it from local farmers and employ local people to operate and maintain the large farm and rice mill. The scheme is ambitious and there are challenges. Rice plants are living things, and this is not like producing a good in a factory. “We are subject to the wind and the rain,” says CASL CEO Laurent Nicolas. “You could say that in our case the factory has no roof and no walls. Farming is hard, and on this scale it requires a lot of organisation and a lot of logistics.” Laurent Nicolas, CEO of CASL Although not yet close to full speed and capacity, the project is already having a positive impact on its surrounding area. New irrigation infrastructure is giving local farmers the chance to cultivate rice on plots which previously lacked this irrigation, and produce two rice harvests per year, in addition to providing water for other crops.

Irrigated rice production Residue management Current status: After harvest of the rice grains, rice straw remains in the field as residue. In the Senegal River Valley, 80 percent of the rice straw residues are burned. A reason for the burning of rice straw is that cattle are wandering around rice fields, releasing their dung in the fields. As dung contains seeds, cattle are seen as a major vector for dissemination of wild rice (which is considered as weed). Straw residues are burned, so cattle do not spend too much time in the field grazing on these residues. The remaining 20 percent of the rice straw residues are either fed to animals or buried in the field as fertilizer. A different situation happens in the Casamance region, where almost no rice straw is burned. The residues are either left in the field for grazing or the straw is buried to improve soil fertility. Burning rice straw in the field can emit substantial amounts of air pollutants, which has a negative impact on the environment and human health (Bogdanski et al. 2016).

Stakeholders from four different groups – a female farmer, two researchers, a civil society representative, and people who have been interacting in an agriculture/governance think tank were then asked to reflect on the predominant issues for each of the aspects considered. (it should be noted that this is not a comprehensive multistakeholder consultation; individuals presented their own perspectives, not ones derived from extensive consultation with their communities. Moreover, the perspective of intermediaries in the food value chain – such as millers and traders – was not represented, due to the limitation of resources. 2From the articulation of these stakeholders, prevailing issues, possibly policy interventions have been formulated (Section 5), and the outcomes of such interventions, as opposed to “business as usual” evaluated using the T21-iSDG model (Section 6).

This had resulted in a more substantial financial burden for women today in comparison to the preceding generation. Therefore, women’s increased economic empowerment had brought with it a more substantial ‘double burden’ for the women as both their domestic and professional responsibilities had increased due to their expanded financial freedom. This finding serves as an example of the complexity of empowerment, since estimating the level of female farmers empowerment is not as clear cut as we might think. Therefore, this finding confirmed what was stated in the theoretical framework, being that female empowerment is not a linear process as the improvement in one aspect might result in negative consequences in another.

Indeed, by setting up systems that force peasant farmers to go into debt in order to farm, the US government is risking the bankruptcy of a large number of peasant farmers and pastoralists. Why do they pursue this course? The best analysis I have seen thus far is by David Andrews who suggests that one way to understand official US thinking on agricultural modernisation is to consider how heavily influenced US government agricultural agencies are by multinational corporations engaged in seed and input production, food production, food processing and food marketing. At the 2001 World Economic Forum in Davos, for example, the US State Department officially named 17 corporations as its 'partners in development', among them Cargill, DuPont, Yara International, Syngenta and Monsanto (Andrews 2011). These, of course, are the very corporations that benefit mightily from AGRA's promotion of their patented seeds, pesticides and herbicides and from MCC projects that open up their access to African land. Their power was recently enhanced when they were officially recognised as the 'private sector partners' in the Group of Eight's New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition unveiled on 18 May 2012 by President Obama.

It is a quite large model with over 3600 state variables and several thousand feedback loops, covering more than 55 sectors.

Yields improve as farmers are able to plant two crops per year, in some cases on the same land.

(6) Manual weed control reduces farmers' exposure to agrochemicals that are potentially harmful to their health. This point is very important in Africa where farmers rarely have access to the proper protective equipment necessary to safely apply such chemicals. Farmers' awareness of proper herbicide dose mixtures and application procedures are often similarly poor, which can reduce the efficiency while increasing the danger of these products once applied. This underscores the need to develop non-chemical weed management alternatives. Moreover, in SRI, manual weed control is reported to incorporate weeds into the soil surface thus cycling nutrients in situ while aerating the soil to facilitate enhanced root growth.

This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers' claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers' yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year. While this approach has obvious limitations, it nonetheless provided an estimate of potential impact of forecast use relative to a wide range of cropping practices and rainfall conditions.

Lack of product uniformity is perceived by consumers in West Africa to lead to longer cooking times and unpredictable preparation requirements, as the cleaning and sorting of this rice prior to cooking is thought to take longer and be more laborious. Credit arrangements also impact the choice of local versus imported rice: Traders in urban areas are reluctant to carry local rice because of lack of credit from wholesalers, whereas credit is generally available from importers and the wholesalers to whom they sell. Senegalese consumers, however, more than consumers in other West African countries show preferences for local, valued Senegal River Valley rice over imported rice due to its taste characteristics, even if impure and poorly sorted. Well-branded rice, designating place of origin, local fragrant rice, also received price premiums. (Diagne et al. 2017; Demont et al. 2012, Rutseart et al 2018) The investment of the government of Rwanda in good quality, but medium sized mills of 1-3 t/hr is proposed as a viable solution in West Africa, where rice may be milled more locally but also of better quality, to compete with imported rice. Fair prices paid to farmers needs to be an important part making such value chains work. In more isolated areas, small mills are seen as appropriate, giving ownership to the co-operatives and individual owners the sense that they are able to make productive investments that capture some of the value added in the commodity chain.

SRI is an agroecological rice production methodology that allows farmers to increase rice productivity while using less seed and water, and fewer purchased agrochemical inputs. SRI rice fields are thought to adapt better to climate change and give off fewer greenhouse gas emissions. SRI does not rely on new varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, or infrastructure to raise yields. Rather, it is a knowledge-based crop management approach that allows plants to better express their genetic potential, which leads to improved plant growth and productivity. Since 2000, SRI has spread to many countries; it is estimated that 10-15 million farmers apply SRI methodologies in more than 55 countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America (Styger & Traoré 2018).

For example, the reports of ``super-high'' rice yields have been widely condemned as faulty by researchers at a number of international institutions. Other critics highlight the risks and disadvantages that should be considered alongside the potential benefits of SRI's principles, such as greater weed growth and high labour requirements, which is not always available to farmers in Senegal (Krupnik & Sarr 2008). In addition, SRI requires strict control over water/water regime for irrigation and drainage, and strict timing is necessary. Besides that this is not always available or feasible it also requires levelled land (Stoop, 2003). As Krupnik and Sarr (2008) state: ``Where farmers cannot enact all of these principles, they are encouraged to adapt and alter parts of the system to fit site-specific agronomic, economic and cultural needs. SRI should consequently not be thought of as a pre-packaged technology; rather it represents an integrated rice production approach that encourages farmers to experiment with and optimize their management of soil, nutrient, water and biological relationships while attempting to maximize the efficient use of scarce natural resources''. This is essential to keep in mind as there might be circumstances in Senegal in which SRI is difficult to apply, for instance direct seeding is rather important in the SRV, there is a lack of equipment for mechanical transplanting, and rice straw and other rice by products are in various cases used for animal feeding.

Proponents of SRI generally argue the agronomic and economic justification for each component as follows: (1) Careful, early transplanting reduces transplanting shock and optimizes tiller development; (2) Wider spacing encourages enhanced root development, interception of solar radiation and tiller production while reducing transplanting time. (3) Transplanting one hill per pocket reduces seed requirements considerably. Intra-specific (rice-rice) competition is also reduced thereby allowing each rice plant to express fully its production potential. (4) Nutrients in organic amendments are quickly made available to the rice crop when soils are intermittently flooded and dried. Organic materials help to build the soil’s inherent fertility level over time thereby facilitating high levels of crop productivity even when mineral fertilizers are lacking. This strategy is thought of as beneficial to resource-poor farmers. Organic materials also improve the functioning of the soil agroecosystem by increasing soil carbon content, water retention potential and by fostering a diversity of soil micro and macro fauna, many of which may be important to optimizing crop nutrient supplies.

Looking at the socio-economic situation, rice production in the River Delta Valley today is more profitable both for male and females as a result of the agricultural intensification. However, the high-intensive form of agriculture demands significant investments since inputs are costly. When asked whether they thought they were economically better off today than 10 years previously, both male and female respondents from all four data collection locations were quite unsure.

However, extension agents involved in field research - even when adaptive - may find it difficult to escape from conceiving of themselves as conveyors of new technologies, rather than as facilitators of social-learning processes (Bentley et al., 2010). We were aware of these issues, and purposefully chose to work with Farmer Field School facilitators who had undergone training in interactive education and extension methodology (see van den Berg and Jiggins, 2007). As such, they were pre-disposed to value farmer experimentation. The graduation from ''learning by doing'' in the first season, to active experimentation in the second and third seasons, was therefore relatively straightforward. This process benefitted just as much from the institutional culture of the Farmer Field School system, which fostered appreciation for farmer-driven experimentation, as it did from the participatory research methods themselves (Van Mele et al., 2011).

The availability of these inputs is low: rice seed is not available among commercial input providers and fertilizer is only available in blends optimized for other crops (such as maize). Farmers are unaccustomed to purchasing inputs for rice production, primarily because they do not value investments in this activity as they do for other, more market-oriented activities. Farmers may be willing to adjust their behavior if they are able to access key inputs at minimal cost and realize a tangible benefit from their use within a single growing season. While direct subsidies may achieve quick results in this area, they will not be sustainable unless investments are made in strengthening the commercial input supply market. These advancements are also likely to increase the productivity of a range of agricultural crops beyond rice.

First of all, as documented earlier, urban consumers prefer broken rice, sorted into categories of homogenous size and they value the cleanness and visual presentation of rice (Fall et al., 2007; Demont et al., forthcoming). In contrast, most of the local paddy rice is only transformed into milled rice at a small informal mill, but not cleaned and sorted (which rural women usually do at home) and it involves mainly intermediary and whole grain rice. Although studies show that urban consumers are willing to pay a higher price for good quality local rice, consumers in Dakar generally believe that local rice is of inferior quality (Fall et al., 2007). There clearly is a mismatch between the product demanded by the majority of Senegalese consumers and the product characteristics of domestic rice that is supplied to them.

Focus group data were interpreted using Verifiable Analysis (Krueger and Casey, 2009). We also constructed crop management budgets with each farmer using data collected from their field sheets and in focus groups.

After careful consultation with participating farmers, extension agents and women involved in transplanting and weeding activities, we valued tasks performed by women or children at 50% the opportunity cost for an 8-h day of adult male labor. Small-scale equipment amortization costs were negligible compared to total expenses; we therefore assumed them to be sunk. Following local practices, harvesting labor was valued at a fixed rate. Threshing in the region is not paid monetarily; instead, farmers are charged in rice at a rate of 10% threshed grain. Yields were adjusted accordingly, and the remaining rice was valued at 0.21 € kg 1 and 0.19 € kg 1 in the 2008 wet and 2009 dry seasons.

However, the commercial market channel of the domestic rice industry is currently too fragmented and risk-averse to perceive and act on any upswing in market demand. Local irrigated rice must improve its awareness among consumers and make significant advances in operations and efficiency to compete more effectively with imported rice. This twopronged strategy of demand-creation and supply-response can create a mutually reinforcing feedback loop that accelerates growth and competitiveness if sufficient enabling conditions are introduced that stimulate an increased commercial orientation in the local rice industry.

The first is a basal application of 100 kg ha 1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, containing 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of 100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in case of transplanting. The third application consists of 100 kg urea ha 1 at panicle initiation (PI), i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers and because farmers want to avoid that weeds profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed with urea and applied at the start of tillering (Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et al., 1999).

Problems related to improving quality seem not to be insurmountable, as they are not inherent to the country or the production system as such. Rather the main problems are due to poor processing, which does not conform to consumer preferences. Currently the largest share of local production passes through small informal mills at the village level, which are unable to sort the rice mechanically or to remove foreign matter. Policies should stimulate private investments in improved processing and sorting of rice. Another way to improve quality is to speed up the drying process of paddy rice. Due to poor storage facilities, rice often is not dried quickly enough, which reduces quality or may even cause the rice to rot.

But the GIEs do not collect more rice than is needed for reimbursement. Every farmer decides individually what he/she wants to do with the remainder of his/her produce.5 Some will keep it all for consumption, some will sell immediately to traders, while others will store some of their production to sell later. In the remainder of this section we will use the terms market participation and selling farmers for those farmers who decide to sell rice individually, meaning in addition to the rice which is sold collectively by the farm organization to reimburse credit.

Before liberalization the GoS shouldered all production and marketing risk, and there as a general expectation that private-sector intermediaries should play the same role. Most producers are not commercially oriented and prefer to make small, intermittent sales to mitigate household risk and smooth consumption. Such transactions significantly constrain processors needing larger supplies. Even if rice traders or mills had sufficient working capital to purchase large quantities of paddy post-harvest, they would find it difficult to find farmers willing to sell in bulk. The more commercially-oriented private producers sell a higher-proportion of their harvest but cultivate smaller plots resulting in lower volumes.

The distances may reveal useful information about collective decision-making. We may reasonably assume that the lower the distance between the individual and the group estimate, the higher the intra-group influence of the individual. The results are presented in the second column and are more or less similar to the WTP regression presented in the first column, the only difference being that labeling has a significantly positive effect on the distance. The latter suggests that region-of-origin labels may increase disagreement among women on whether these extrinsic cues guarantee intrinsic quality or whether they deserve a higher price due to patriotic or emotional involvement (Obermiller and Spangenberg 1989). ′ The results from table 3 warrant an in-depth analysis. Therefore, we adopt an approach commonly used in the psychological literature in which we assume that group decision are weighted sums of individual preferences and that the individual weights, i.e. the intra-group influence of individuals, is exponential in nature (Bonner, Sillito and Baumann 2007; Davis 1996). First, to eliminate scale biases we standardize the continuous variables to the interval [0,1] in two alternative ways by dividing them by the sample maximum and the minimum.4 Next, we take the natural exponential of the continuous variables and leave the dummy variables unchanged. We finally predict the CWTPs for each session i (i = 1,…, n = 10) and each product p (p = 1,…,3) using each of the alternative socio-demographic variables j (j = 1, …, k = 12): 4 Dividing by the sample maximum diminishes the effect of the variables, dividing by the minimum amplifies the effect.

Under experimental conditions, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to pay an 18 percent price premium for imported Thai 100 percent broken rice relative to conventional, ungraded SRV rice. However, they were willing to pay an even larger price premium, 35 percent, to obtain enhanced-quality SRV broken rice. Conventional, ungraded SRV rice is a mix of varieties, has a mediocre grain quality, and is commonly available on the market. Imported Thai 100 percent broken rice has a grain quality somewhere between the conventional and the enhanced-quality SRV broken rice and contains some impurities. Enhanced quality SRV broken rice is purified and homogenized through one or two sifting operations. On top of the price premium of 35 percent for enhanced quality SRV broken rice, the majority of Senegalese consumers were willing to add another 6 percent for a branded rice product, paying an overall price premium of 41 percent for PINORD’s Rival® (see Box 1) relative to conventional SRV rice. These findings suggest that Senegalese consumers are willing to pay for intrinsic food quality attributes and that SRV rice is able to compete against imported rice if post-harvest quality is tailored to consumer preferences. 11 But also breeding currently plays a role in tailoring quality to urban consumer preferences. In 2011, three fragrant rice varieties bred by AfricaRice (Sahel 177, 328 and 329) have been introduced in the SRV. Given that an important market segment of urban consumers (particularly in Dakar) prefers imported fragrant rice, this introduction opens the door for the development of domestic value chains of fragrant rice and further replacing imports with domestic rice. 11 Enhancing quality in the context of a food insecure country may seem counterintuitive at first, but is consistent with similar findings in Asia revealing that even the very poor have more income elastic demand for food quality than for food quantity (Shah, 1983).

Import vs. domestic production Current status: Rice is Senegal’s staple crop, and since the 1980s, the country has emphasized rice production through subsidies, extension, and infrastructure, but has failed to compete commercially with imported rice (Dermont and Rizzotto 2012). This is partly due to the government’s focus on urban populations and their efforts to import cheap rice from Asia (Khouma et al. 2012, GFC website).

First, we conduct an experimental auction on food in a poor, least developed country (LDC) under challenging conditions of high illiteracy, limited technical possibilities and low education levels. With the exception of Masters and Sanogo (2002), no similar market experiments have been published in the context of LDCs. While their study is based on a choice experiment, we use the auction mechanism as methodology to elicit WTP values. Surprisingly, very few experimental auctions have been published on developing countries, where consumers are usually more acquainted with negotiable prices and the market system, and are, therefore, more used to conforming their WTP to the food sellers’ willingness-to-accept (WTA) than consumers in developed countries. Moreover, these consumers typically spend larger shares of their budgets on food and demand for food is more elastic. In other words, they respond more actively to market prices necessitating frequent cognitive efforts to estimate their WTP and a better knowledge of market prices as the latter directly affect their welfare.

To our knowledge, the gap between these two distinct disciplinary fields has never been bridged so far. The only exception, and most closely related study, is the paper of Maciejovsky and Budescu (2007), who compared cooperative groups and competitive auctions and concluded that competitive auctions induce learning effects equally impressive as those of standard group interactions. However, the authors oppose both methods and completely separate them in their experimental setting by using two distinct samples, while we combine both methods in a single experiment on a single sample and generate novel information on the interaction between both methods. Moreover, the authors do not directly use the data generated by the auctions, but only use the latter to create competitive decision settings among subjects.

We use Vickrey second price auctions to elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) to exchange mediocre Senegal River Valley (SRV) rice into unlabeled quality SRV rice, labeled (Rival) quality SRV rice and labeled (Thai-25) imported rice. We include experimental interaction between participants by introducing the concept of collective willingness-to-pay (CWTP) through consensus sessions. The participants are willing to pay an 80 percent higher price premium for local quality rice than for imported rice. This indicates that the local quality rice brand Rival is able to compete against imported rice. Bids are influenced by tasting and the time of the day during which the rice is auctioned; socio-demographic variables have very little influence on bids. Remarkably, in contrast to individual bids, collective consensus exhibits a significantly positive label effect. These findings are important for designing labeling and marketing strategies and provide useful information for rice traders, retailers and local rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley and national policy makers who are currently implementing an ambitious food self-sufficiency program. Understanding the group estimation process was a second goal of our research and the results show that age is an important factor in collective decision-making. The latter provides useful information for designing collective value chain and generic promotion strategies through exploiting social capital and networks.

However, the villagers were able to increase their tomato-cropping acreage using their personal funds because SOCAS actually purchased all harvested tomatoes, with or without a contract. During the tomato-harvest period, cargo trucks came to the tomato fields and automatically conveyed cases of tomatoes to the SOCAS factory. Moreover, the villagers were able to sell tomatoes at a fixed price that had been set in the purchase contract: in 2009/10, the price was 51.5 F CFA per kilogram. They did not have tofind private merchants, research tomato prices, bargain with merchants over prices, or worry about the risk of tomato-price collapse. Therefore, peasants were able to anticipate more steady and secure income from tomato production than from rice production.

The number of schools benefiting from canteens dropped from 180 to 90 in two academic years, and by the end of November 2016 no school was running its canteen. The continuity of operating school canteens is a battle that is far from being won. Moreover, schools benefiting from PAA Senegal have not learned how to source directly from local producers to the extent that dealings between the two categories of beneficiaries has not been tested by the project. However, buying local products to feed the students is PAA Africa’s pioneering idea. WFP was directly responsible for purchasing rice from producers; the schools received rice directly from WFP and were not in direct relation with the producers. How can the concept then become functional if the project ends before the concept is tested?” Consumption patterns issues from a civil society perspective: Rice is a strategic cereal for Senegal, given its prominent place in the eating habits of Senegalese people and its weight on the country's trade balance. With an estimated demand of 3000 tonnes of rice per day, or an estimated consumption of 78 kg/year per capita, Senegal is one of the largest rice consumers in West Africa. However, the tragedy is that the State, through its National Rice Self-Sufficiency Programme (PNAR), has put more emphasis on the quantity to be produced without worrying about the disastrous consequences of the conventional production system promoted against the environment and human health. The local rice consumed is treated with dangerous chemical herbicides. Beyond the availability of food, it must be safe for human, animal and environmental health.

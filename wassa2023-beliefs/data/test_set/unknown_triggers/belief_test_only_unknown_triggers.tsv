This shows that the farmers of the two sites (Ndiaye and Fanaye) are interested in these two types of lines especially intra-specific lines, including those from the series of WAS173, who presented the best average grain yields. The duration sowing maturity seems to be variously appreciated by sites. The farmers of the site Ndiaye, have far more privileged earliness while those of Fanaye area, chose the varieties with average cycle or a long cycle. Discussions with farmers highlighted a preference for early cycles in the delta (Ndiaye) unlike the peasants of the Middle Valley (Fanaye), which seem to opt for medium or long cycles. The Delta area is characterized by salinity of soil and seasonal temperature drops. Early varieties allow them to harvest before the November drops in temperature that reduce overwintering crop yields for longer cycles, and also to practice double cropping rice / rice. Precocity is also an advantage during the semi belated, hence their preference for short cycle varieties. At Fanaye farmers prefer rather varieties with a medium or long cycle, which they consider more profitable because of better grain filling unlike the short-season varieties, which are characterized in this site by poor filling seeds.

Both SRI and RMP used line transplanting, which required slightly more labor than in FP, although farmers expressed that they found uniform spacing to be advantageous for crop development, and for simplifying weeding. Participantfarmers acknowledged these issues, but suggested that such difficulties could be overcome with increased experience and training in Farmer Field Schools. To address seedling mortality risk in SRI, they suggested using 2–3 slightly older, rather than one very young seedling per hill.

For example, the reports of “super-high” rice yields have been widely condemned as faulty by researchers at a number of international institutions. Other critics highlight the risks and disadvantages that should be considered along side the potential benefits of SRI’s principles: (1) Where water is difficult to control or where drainage is impossible, transplanting small, young seedlings increases the risk of prolonged submergence and mortality. Some farmers may also report that transplanting small seedlings in lines is tedious work, or that it is difficult to find labor for transplanting in the relatively scarcely populated Senegal River Valley.

At a high level, they are motivated by the national plan for self-sufficiency in rice and will do whatever it takes to achieve the ambitious, primarily production-oriented targets set by the plan. At a lower level, they very much see their role as supporting the smallholder farmer, especially in the state-led welfare role of the pre-liberalization period. The farmers trust the front-line government specialists who interact with them and have grown to expect the state to mitigate or assume virtually all risk in the rice sector. The government has little experience in engaging and supporting the private sector and tends to view them as predatory.

Another question that arose in our work regarding diet has to be mentioned. While the kitchen space was clearly described by local women as a food space in continuity with the agricultural space where the sovereignty of women was exercised and where they expressed and improved a whole series of knowledge dishes (Fig. S4 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material), it would be desirable to continue investigations into the links between dishes and associated plants, all the more so since these are subjects that arouse great interest among women. We initiated this approach by starting with certain emblematic, such as preparations based on cowpeas or sorghum coucous (niri) whose consumption has fallen sharply due to lower production and higher purchase costs. Different preparations are associated with niri: niri Kosam (with milk), niri bouna (with dried fish) or niri beref. There are emblematic dishes, still prepared for certain occasions such as baptisms and weddings and associated with good health and culinary heritage. This study confirms, notably following Howard (2003), that culinary traditions are a major element in the preservation of wild and cultivated biodiversity. If culinary traditions are diminishing, the reasons for conserving these plants useful for food, as well as the knowledge associated with them (cultivation, processing, and storage) are also being lost. Thus, the work of women in the transmission of culinary knowledge is of great importance, and this makes the kitchen the primary place for maintaining biodiversity. In addition to being a place for conserving plants, the kitchen is also a place for creating emotions and memories. Thus, to evoke food and its evolution is also to evoke the memories associated with it by appealing to the senses.

However, the villagers were able to increase their tomato-cropping acreage using their personal funds because SOCAS actually purchased all harvested tomatoes, with or without a contract. During the tomato-harvest period, cargo trucks came to the tomato fi elds and automatically conveyed cases of tomatoes to the SOCAS factory. Moreover, the villagers were able to sell tomatoes at a fi xed price that had been set in the purchase contract: in 2009/10, the price was 51.5 F CFA per kilogram. They did not have to fi nd private merchants, research tomato prices, bargain with merchants over prices, or worry about the risk of tomato-price collapse. Therefore, peasants were able to anticipate more steady and secure income from tomato production than from rice production.

Indeed, it would be expected that these organizations providing public goods benefit at least all their members, if not the entire community. The significant difference highlighted for COs in Table 9 may therefore suggest that other phenomena are at play, the straightforward hypothesis being the presence of elite capture within these organizations. Indeed, being essentially redistributive organizations, COs may facilitate rent seeking behavior from some of its members. If true, one would then expect that leaders benefit more from the services of the organization than the rest of the members, engaging in corruption.

Contrasting the appropriation of benefits between leaders and non-leaders shows the remarkable ability of bureaucratic procedures in holding in check potential abuse of leadership. Leaders do not derive differential benefits from MOs compared to other members. In COs, we see that leaders derive less benefits than other members in Senegal. While there may be a bias in reporting, we were frequently told in case studies that leaders are cautious in not being served first not to jeopardize their leadership positions. The observed differences within COs in Table 9 may then be attributed to different mix of poverty levels across organizations. Systematically associating resource management by local organizations with elite capture, as done in much of the literature on decentralization and participation, can be quite misleading. Here, the issue is less capture and corruption than low management capacity and lack of access to resources.	Do Village Organizations Make a Difference in African Rural Development?

Most traders, wholesalers and processors expressed a desire for more formalized and longer-term relationships with producers but were certain that farmers would not agree to such arrangements, even if they were also in their best interest. Private-sector actors expect their business partners to share some degree of risk in their transactions, which tends to conflict with farmers’ collective aversion for risk in rice production and marketing. These actors seem willing to invest in closer relationships with farmers (as well as elements such as embedded services that help to drive such relationships) if mutually acceptable models can be found.

Globally, in irrigated plots of the Waalo, under the responsibility of the men, almost exclusively owners of the land, the women were carrying out different strategic tasks (transplanting, weeding, guarding the cultivation against birds, harvesting) for the production of rice, onions and tomatoes. The new agro-system organization has created a novel female status, that of the ‘woman who helps’, which means she loses all family and social recognition. Even when migration kept young men absent and women were involved in many tasks, they very rarely gained recognition with strategic bodies (Top, 2014). When the lack of manpower made it necessary to make choices between crops in the irrigated Waalo or flood basins, the family choice gave priority to irrigated plots and rice that became strategic for the families’ food security and for earning money. The Waalo has thus lost its place as a feeding ground to irrigated areas, and to rice, which is now the staple food of the peasants. Sorghum, on the other hand, was becoming a cash crop for some families, who preferred to sell it when they grew it because: ‘The 50 kg bag is worth 30,000 FCFA for sorghum against 15,000 FCFA for rice. The women sell and the profits go to the husband but are shared in the family in the form of food’.

This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women .	traditionally	b	When focusing on recession sorghum growing in the Waloo, women listed up to 19 varieties whereas only 5 of them were still cultivated. The other varieties are still available locally, preserved by some families and sold in the bush markets; they are still present, too, in culinary memories. The women were able to accurately describe the characteristics of the grain and flour, the related agricultural practices (e.g. crop cycle, seasonality), the interests and disadvantages of cultivating the variety, and the management of seeds. This was explained by the fact that seed management and breeding were traditionally the responsibility of women. All these varieties were local or peasant. A summarized description of the 8 most cited recession sorghum varieties and photographs can be found in Tables S1 and Fig. S3 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material. Briefly, the 3 most frequently cited varieties were Poordi (which means brown, the color of the seed), Mariam Sowdou (from the name of the woman who introduced and spread it) and Balieri (which means white). Yellow variety (Paaca) was also mentioned. The choice of cultivating one or another variety was guided by the length of the crop cycle (e.g. the Poordi cycle was 20 days shorter than the Balieri cycle) and bird attacks (e.g. the Balieri was less sensitive compared to Poordi). As a result, the Poordi variety was the most cultivated while its bitter taste (a protective factor against bird attacks) was less and less appreciated by the families. Among the 19 other varieties mentioned, the cultivation of most of them has been abandoned due to longer cycles (e.g. Bobo jamm and Samba Souké). In addition, the decrease in flooding for several consecutive years has had consequences for the seed conservation of these different varieties. Because the maximum storage time is two years according to women involved in sorghum breeding, and because of the uncertainty of the next floods, women progressively stopped keeping seeds and preferred to buy them at the market or from neighbors. Nevertheless, some women did their best to save sorghum seeds.	Expanding and intensifying rice production consequences on agrobiodiversity management and diet quality.

(1992), Carrasco-Tauber and Moffitt (1992), Chambers and Lichtenberg (1994), Saha et al. (1997), Huang et al. (2002), Norwood and Marra (2003), Qaim (2003) and Shankar and Thirtle (2005). This output oriented damage abatement specification (i.e. DA inputs reduce the loss inflicted on potential output) was questioned however by Carpentier and Weaver (1997), who proposed an input damage abatement specification which was further elaborated by Oude Lansink and Carpentier (2001). The input damage abatement specification is a more general treatment and is based on the principle that DA inputs have an impact on the productivity of productive inputs. Zhengfei et al. (2005) expanded the DA literature further by proposing an input damage abatement specification that allows marginal products of pesticides to be negative (these were presumed to be positive a priori in previous literature) and allows inputs to be both damage abating and yield increasing. One year later, Zhengfei et al. (2006) broadened this DA framework by presenting a new dichotomous paradigm based on agronomic insights that categorizes inputs into growthand facilitating inputs. Kuosmanen, Pemsl and Wesseler (2006) step aside from the standard production function approach to estimate the productivity of damage control inputs and employ a two-stage semi parametric technique to estimate the productivity of damage control inputs. This approach combines the attractive features of both nonparametric features (e.g. no need for assumptions about functional forms and parameter restrictions) and parametric features (e.g. the ability to summarize productivities into a single coefficient). In this specification, they specify damage agent variables as slope dummies, which they show to have a major impact on the effectiveness of the DA inputs they considered. Despite the recent development of the input DA approach in the literature, an output DA approach can still be meaningful however when an input DA approach is not preferable due to its high level of non-linearity and the related estimation problems.

We also consider that this distance has little probability of affecting producers’ outcomes, not considering the effect of the contract. Indeed, it is not an indicator of farm isolation, which could influence farmers’ access to inputs, advisory centers, paddy markets or food markets, or an indicator of differences between agro-ecological areas. As shown in Fig. 2, there are two tarmacked roads in the département, and the distance to these roads is the main indicator of farm isolation rather than the distance between farms and rice millers offering production contracts. These millers are located in the North, around the city of Rosso-Senegal. As a result, some farms located a certain distance from these rice millers are close to tarmacked roads while others located the same distance from the rice millers can be found much further from tarmacked roads. Furthermore, surveyed farms are in the same agro-ecological environment, which is the irrigated part of the département.

(2000, 2001) demonstrated the profitability of improved soil fertility and weed management for small and large scale rice farmers in Senegal and Mauritania. Another possibility to raise profitability would be to improve the quality of rice produced. Price differences in Senegal between low and high quality rice are huge. Whole grain American rice is sold in the Senegalese capital Dakar for 380 CFA1 kg−1, whole grain rice imported from India of lower quality (dark color, relative high percentage of impurities) sells for 190 CFA kg−1. Imported broken rice from Vietnam, Thailand, India, Pakistan and Argentina sells for 160–175 CFA kg−1. An estimated 350,000–450,000 t of rice is consumed annually in Senegal, of which 15,000 tons is whole grain rice. The Mauritanian and Senegalese governments consider raising the quality of domestically produced rice as a prerequisite to improve its competitiveness vis à vis imports. In Senegal, the national irrigation and extension authority for the Senegal River valley (SAED) has launched a rice quality program since 1998. Its objective is to increase production and value of locally produced rice.	Effect of late nitrogen application on rice yield, grain quality and profitability in the Senegal River valley	M.M.

The budget for this big push was set at CFAF 355 billion or $600 million, though at the time of the announcement the GOS had funding of only CFAF 32.2 billion.17 For rice, this included CFAF 13 billion for tractors and 2.4 billion for combines. 16 Rice crisis, market trends, and food security in West Africa. http://www.oecd.org/swac/publications/47853480.pdf It is produced by consortium of organizations, including CILSS, CIRAD, FAO, FEWSNET, and the WFP (World Food Program). It is funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 17 GOANA was widely criticized at the time, including by the Conseil National de Concertation et de Coopération des Ruraux (CNCR – the National Council for Rural Cooperation and Consultation), the national quasi-official farmers’ organization. The various criticisms included fact that the goals were way too ambitious, the cost per ton was way too high, there was no way the GOS would be able to obtain and distribute sufficient agricultural inputs in a timely way, and that this was simply opening the door to vast corruption by organizations without distribution networks. It was also seen as a ploy to give land to the politically favored. The word “gabegie” was widely used, meaning defective and dishonest financial management, or waste.

As typically in small family farming, the diversification of sources of income and food production is the main strategy of the families. The recession cultivation of sorghum fulfilled this function perfectly because it cost much less to grow (requiring less work and no inputs) and provided more money than rice that is sold by the kilo for twice the price. Nevertheless, such a strategy faced several limitations. Aiming for food security much more than for the achievement of good rice yields placed the families at odds with the demand of the public authorities transmitted by SAED which relates only to the objectives in terms of irrigated area and annual production: the rice production is expected to increase from 455,000 tons in 2018 to 875,000 tons in 2020. As a consequence of this mismatch between local and national objectives, families cannot but deplore the lack of technical and financial support from public authorities for the carrying out of diversification activities. Another important limitation was the land constraint, especially because the Waalo lands prone to flood recession culture are never sold if not occupied by rice, tomato or onion (Bruckmann, 2018). According to the perception of being food secure, defined by families as being able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and having extra assets from off-farm activities or expatriates, different strategies of production and limitations were described (Table 1).

Rice has a unique center of origin in West Africa , for the African rice species ( Oryza glabberrima ) .		n	With its long history of cultivation and selection under diverse environments, rice has acquired a wide adaptability enabling it to grow in a range of environments, from deep water to swamps, irrigated and wetland conditions, as well as on dry hill slopes. Probably far more than any other crop, rice can grow under diverse geographical, climatic and cultural conditions. The quality preferences of rice consumers, over millennia, have resulted in a wide diversity of varieties specific to different localities. Rice has a unique center of origin in West Africa, for the African rice species (Oryza glabberrima). According to Cubry et al (2018), the Oryza glabberrima was domesticated in the inner Niger Delta. This Africa rice species has been partly replaced by higheryielding Asian rice, but it nonetheless persists, particularly in upland environments. African rice is hardy and pest-resistant crop, well adapted to a variety of African conditions (Linares 2002) and often preferred for its nutty taste. African rice holds unique cultural values; for instance, it is sacred to the Jola people in the Casamance region of Senegal5, and is a heritage variety in the United States, having been brought to the New World by slaves (Carney 2009). The genetic traits of African rice have been used in breeding programs to develop NERICA, the “New Rice for Africa” (Sarla et al. 2005).

Fourth , the methodological setup of this thesis has limitations .		n	Fourth, the methodological setup of this thesis has limitations. To start with, the thesis is based on a cross-sectional survey which could yield results biased by specific events which happened during the reference year. The 2014 agricultural seasons may be considered as “normal” in terms of yields. But the context of the VC during that year could be considered as specific, with the low rice price on the global market and the policy ensuring rice marketing through an agreement involving importers in the domestic VC. Such specific factors could limit the external validity of results. Furthermore, the decision to become involved in contracts is based on a producer’s characteristics such as experience or indebtedness, which evolve over time. As a result, participation in contracts should be analyzed with a dynamic approach and longitudinal surveys. Due to time constraints, the thesis did not allow such an approach. The second methodological limitation is linked to the impact evaluation models used to correct selection bias. Such methods were developed by sciences in which the researcher has total control over the experiment. They rely on the hypothesis that control and treated groups have similar features, and that their difference in participation is due to external random factors. Nevertheless, using them in development economics raises the risk that the researcher overlook fundamental differences in the two groups in order to comply with this methodological hypothesis. The third methodological limitation is due to the way the impact estimation methods were used. Characteristics of producers may have been overlooked, which can be a source of endogeneity. As explained earlier, I did not use longitudinal surveys and therefore could not use the “difference-in-difference” method which enables correction for time-constant omitted variables. There could also be contagion effects, such as how the price negotiated in spot transactions could affect, or be affected by, prices implemented within contracts.

Despite the presence of chlorophyll and photosynthetically active leaves ( Press et al ., 1991 ) , these parasitic plants can severely reduce growth and development of the infected host plant .		n	Striga spp. (witchweeds) are annual, obligate hemiparasitic weeds on tropical cereal crops like maize, sorghum, and rice. Despite the presence of chlorophyll and photosynthetically active leaves (Press et al., 1991), these parasitic plants can severely reduce growth and development of the infected host plant. They parasitize host roots through a xylem-to-xylem connection made by a special organ, the haustorium (Parker and Riches, 1993). Through this connection, the parasite subtracts host-plant metabolites, water, nutrients, and amino acids (e.g., Press et al., 1987; Rogers and Nelson, 1962) and alters the hormone balance (Drennan and El Hiweris, 1979; Frost et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1996). Most of the studies showing these effects have been conducted with C4 hosts (e.g., sorghum and maize), but similar interactions are expected with C3 hosts such as rice. Susceptible and sensitive rice varieties show stunted growth, low biomass production Weed Management in Rice-Based Cropping Systems in Africa 161 and failure to flower (Riches et al., 1996). In a study by Cechin and Press (1994), rice plants infected with S. hermonthica did not produce any grain. This was partly attributed to reduced shoot growth and partly to reductions of up to 44% in photosynthesis compared to uninfected control plants. Severe crop damage (60–100%) has been reported in cases of heavy infestation with the parasitic weed Striga asiatica in Madagascar (e.g., Elliot et al., 1993).

The SRV is the core area of rice production in Senegal. It provided 80% of domestic production in 2014 (USDA, 2015). Some 45,000 family farmers are involved in rice production in the SRV (Gergely and Baris, 2009). At the scale of the region of Saint Louis which includes Dagana Department, 39.5% of households were poor in 2010 (ANSD, 2010). And 16.1% of households in Dagana Department were affected by food insecurity (WFP, 2014). More information about the rice VC and the study area is given based on the requirements of the research questions addressed in each chapter. 25 Data are available at http://data.worldbank.org/ Rice is a politically strategic product in West Africa because it is a major contribution to national food security. Since independence, government strategies aim at supplying rice at low prices to the population. Certain researchers consider that there was an “urban bias” during the three last decades. Indeed, little support was given to agricultural production, and the strategy was to import cheap rice for urban consumers, who make up the main part of voters (Bezemer and Headey, 2008). Policies implemented after the price crisis also purport to supplying low-cost rice, but now through modernization of the domestic rice chain.

In addition , the prospects of gaining from credit in terms of increased capacity and performance could well be a driver to farmers ’ likelihood to enter the market and seek credit .		n	A two-stage, endogenous switching regression (ESR) model is considered: the first stage is concerned with the likelihood that a farmer has access to credit (or, inversely, is credit constrained), while the second stage relates performance to access to credit by comparing farmers with and without access to credit. This empirical framework combines two potential characteristics of the interactions between farmers‘ decisions to apply and eventually obtain credit and the associated productivity outcome, namely, endogeneity of and self-selectivity (Maddala and Nelson 1975). In effect, it is assumed that some unobserved characteristics may well affect both the probability of being credit-constrained and productivity (say, a weather shock that tends to simultaneously reduce performance and reduce farmers’ credit-worthiness). In addition, the prospects of gaining from credit in terms of increased capacity and performance could well be a driver to farmers’ likelihood to enter the market and seek credit. Neglecting these issues, as a regular Ordinarily Least Squares (OLS) estimation would do, could lead to biased and inconsistent estimates. The model is used by many to address similar issues, such as Ali, Deininger, and Duponchel (2014) and Awotide et al. (2015) who looked at the impact of access to credit on the farm performance, as well as Seck (2017) who looked at the impact of fertilizer subsidy on farmers’ performance in the same agro-ecological region of the Senegal River Valley (with the same dataset used here).

Scaling up in the upper parts of the SRV will be more challenging as the existing irrigation infrastructure and value chains are much less dense.

According to Figure 1 , recently , consumption has significantly exceeded production .		n	Traditionally, Africans would regard cereals such as sorghum and millet as their staple foods. However, in recent years, the consumption of rice has rapidly increased. Particularly, in West African countries, annual rice consumption per capita has tripled over the past 40 years (Africa Rice Center, 2005). This increase, observed in the urban areas, is perhaps because rice requires a shorter time to cook than other cereals (Hiraoka, 2017). In West African countries, where economic development is expected to accelerate in the future, urbanization is expected to be promoted partly by increasing rice consumption (Tsuboi et al., 2008). However, the domestic production of rice remains low, as evidenced by the 2.5 [t/ha] of land-based rice productivity in West Africa in 2005 (Africa Rice Center, 2007). According to Figure 1, recently, consumption has significantly exceeded production. To meet the increasing demand for rice, 6 million tons of rice are imported every year (Stryker, 2013). In 2008, when the food crisis occurred, a significant number of West African countries experienced starvation due to steep increases in the price of imported rice. In terms of food security, the governments of these countries have adopted certain agricultural policies and projects to strengthen the rice production sector (Dupraz et al., 2013).

Until 2010 , when funded by this bank , farmers combined two types of spot transactions ( including relational components ) : collective sales to repay the loan and individual sales to meet household ’ s needs .		n	Rice producers in the SRV have several marketing options that they use and combine according to their livelihoods and perception of uncertainty. The main driver to participation in marketing and production contracts is the financial requirement of farms, mainly represented by the access of producer organizations to credit with the national bank. In Dagana Department, farmers growing rice are specialized and commercial banks are limited. The national bank is the main source of credit. Until 2010, when funded by this bank, farmers combined two types of spot transactions (including relational components): collective sales to repay the loan and individual sales to meet household’s needs. However, information imperfection and enforcement failure have led to low reimbursement levels and the bank has followed several recovery plans. Policies recently set up marketing contracts to secure the reimbursement of credit in addition to improving miller supplies. The bank promotes the use of marketing contracts. Producers allowed to use a credit at the bank are therefore more likely to participate in marketing contracts, especially when they perceive high uncertainty over access of credit, outlets and price fluctuations. On the contrary, producer organizations excluded from credit by the national bank have few financing options. Exclusion from credit at the national bank has therefore a positive influence on participation in production contracts when farms are within the activity radius of rice millers that make such agreements available. Therefore, the segmentation of the credit market is linked to the indebtedness of producers to the bank. The second driver that encourages producer organizations to participate in production contracts is the perception of uncertainty over delays in access to inputs and price fluctuations. There is also a category of producers which is specialized in rice growing, excluded from the national bank credit and located beyond the reach of rice millers offering production contracts. This category has no other source of credit and was thus unable to grow rice in the dry season of 2014.

This system , henceforward referred to as Farmer Adapted Practice ( FAP ) , was designed to respond to the constraints identified in earlier discussions .		n	These trade-offs provided the basis for further discussion regarding the most pragmatic components of each crop management system, which we grouped according to management theme (e.g. transplanting, soil fertility or weed management, etc.) and listed on poster-boards. Although each farmer stated somewhat individual preferences, we guided the group towards consensus by asking farmers to discuss the most useful components under each theme. Following these discussions, we collectively agreed to evaluate a fourth crop management system. This system, henceforward referred to as Farmer Adapted Practice (FAP), was designed to respond to the constraints identified in earlier discussions. To maintain treatment consistency, participating farmers uniformly implemented FAP, which included transplanting three 17–19 day old seedlings per hill at 20 20 cm spacing, with recommended fertilizer management (Table 2). Farmers attempted to use alternate wetting and drying irrigation only in the late vegetative stage, primarily because they felt that floodwater was necessary to suppress early-season weed growth. To address labor demand and herbicide dependence in SRI and RMP, farmers agreed to mechanically weed once around 20 days after transplanting, and spot apply herbicides (6:1 propanil to 2,4-D ratio) 12–17 days later, only where weed presence warranted action.

Risks for rice cultivation in the wet season include delayed sowing causing yield reduction , birds , diseases and pests .		n	Double rice cropping was more common in the Delta than in the middle valley. Rice grown in the hot dry season produced higher yields and was perceived to have lower risks than rice grown in the wet season. Risks for rice cultivation in the wet season include delayed sowing causing yield reduction, birds, diseases and pests. As a result, farmers massively shift rice cultivation from the wet season to the hot dry season (Zwart et al., 2017). We also found that complex socio-economic and institutional structures (e.g., Farmers’ union, in French: Union des producteurs) exist within a village and shape farming activities such as decisions regarding which crop to grow, and farm machinery purchase and usage schedule. Also, successful rice cultivation, especially double rice cropping, was very much dependent on machinery availability (combine harvester and tractor). Number of machines are limited, and furthermore once they are broken, they cannot be easily repaired locally, as most of the machines are imported with no spare parts. As optimum sowing window in the wet season cropping is immediately after harvesting rice in the hot dry season, such machinery unavailability results in delayed sowing in the wet season, causing significant yield reduction (Tanaka et al., 2015). It is also noted that delay in credit procurement also caused delayed sowing (Tanaka et al., 2018).

What organizations need to effectively make a difference in enhancing revenues for their members and their communities is greater access to professional capacity building and to financial resources .		n	These results suggest several policy implications to support VOs. First, organizations should be considered in their diversity. In particular, MOs and COs do not require similar types of assistance. MOs typically generate income opportunities for their members, and management capacity is crucial for the organization to access resources and manage them effectively. By contrast, COs are essentially redistributive organizations. For this reason, financial support to COs through grants and loans is critical for them to have public goods and transfers that they can distribute to members. Second, VOs are highly dependent on the community context in which they evolve. In some cases, efforts should be made to encourage the emergence of MOs otherwise constrained, either through support to local entrepreneurs, or through the provision of efficient insurance mechanisms so that differentiation is no longer perceived as a threat to the community. The encouraging observation is that elite capture and corruption do not appear to be constraining factors on performance. What organizations need to effectively make a difference in enhancing revenues for their members and their communities is greater access to professional capacity building and to financial resources. Only then will extensive presence of organizations translate into more than penny capitalism, and effectively support successful smallholder agricultural development and improved rural well being in West Africa.

These events may be more social in nature , for instance combined with local cultural events , or organized for more explicitly commercial purposes , such as a buying day or bourse .		n	The high level of risk endemic in the domestic rice sector seems to originate with the disengagement of the GoS from rice production and marketing. Farmers still expect most of their risk to be borne by other parties, while private-sector actors are reluctant to become entangled in lop-sided relationships where their risk is higher than their returns. Enhanced interaction among different actors can improve their appreciation for each other’s motivations and operational tactics, providing a strong foundation for win-win relationships to develop. Past efforts in other sectors have shown that buyer/seller events can provide the structure for this interaction to occur. These events may be more social in nature, for instance combined with local cultural events, or organized for more explicitly commercial purposes, such as a buying day or bourse. Thereafter, other interventions can help to provide the building blocks for ongoing risk sharing and management. Production planning among farmers is a critical starting point for them to negotiate and deliver on longer-term contracts. Strategic alliances among producers, buyers or processors, and service providers can facilitate a range of forward contracting, embedded services and predictable inventory levels with acceptable levels of risk shared among all parties.

Those projections are useful to learn about the general causal relations , the unintended and unexpected side-effects , the impeding and counteracting factors for improvement to support the development of coherent and effective strategies for development .		n	The long-term nature of the projections that we analyse implies a series of limitations for the results that we produce. First, policy responses to the prevailing issues in rice have been articulated by diverse stakeholders, but each has contributed from their personal knowledge, not through an elaborate multistakeholder process that should precede the confirmation and adoption of policies. Second, all the simulation results should not be taken as precise forecasts, but rather as indications of trends and policy impacts obtained under a precise set of assumptions. Those projections are useful to learn about the general causal relations, the unintended and unexpected side-effects, the impeding and counteracting factors for improvement to support the development of coherent and effective strategies for development. Third, the model is formulated at a high level of aggregation and focuses on the representation of the interlinkages between the different sectors. On the one hand that means that also in the agricultural sector, we analyse policies and effects from an aggregated perspective. On the other hand, this aggregation and macro perspective allows us to assess the intersectoral effects, dependencies and impacts. In a subsequent stage of the policy process these results should inform the use of sectorial models and other more detailed planning tools. Fourth, there are factors and causalities that are not integrated in the model. These are the results of a balancing act, in which we aim at integrating the main relevant links without including too many factors that would impede adopting a macro-perspective. In addition, some interdependencies might not have been included in the model due to lack of data or other kind of evidence concerning that specific causal relationship. Finally, our model is implemented at the national level and does not account for diversity at the sub-national level, which should be considered for successful implementation.

This article contributes to the experimental auction literature on two points .		n	This article contributes to the experimental auction literature on two points. First, we conduct an experimental auction on food in a poor, least developed country (LDC) under challenging conditions of high illiteracy, limited technical possibilities and low education levels. With the exception of Masters and Sanogo (2002), no similar market experiments have been published in the context of LDCs. While their study is based on a choice experiment, we use the auction mechanism as methodology to elicit WTP values. Surprisingly, very few experimental auctions have been published on developing countries, where consumers are usually more acquainted with negotiable prices and the market system, and are, therefore, more used to conforming their WTP to the food sellers’ willingness-to-accept (WTA) than consumers in developed countries. Moreover, these consumers typically spend larger shares of their budgets on food and demand for food is more elastic. In other words, they respond more actively to market prices necessitating frequent cognitive efforts to estimate their WTP and a better knowledge of market prices as the latter directly affect their welfare.

February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June , when temperatures are very high , which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat .		n	RIDEV-simulated year-round variability of spikelet sterility and growth duration using Podor weather data (Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 3. If one would accept an average spikelet sterility of 15% or less (this percentage can be greater than 30% in a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 September. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August. January sowing may lead to flowering in April, when temperatures are still relatively low, in some years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold. February and March sowing may lead to flowering in May to early June, when temperatures are very high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods need to be moved forward by 10 /15 days. At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods (from 22 December to 1 January and from 31 January to 22 February) are too short to sow all the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e. about 5 months. The average growth duration in the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop on the same field. Double cropping requires good collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow two crops on different fields or schemes.

Survey data The farm survey was conducted by Lépine (2009) in three rural communities of the Saint-Louis region in Senegal: Ross Béthio, Gaë and Guédé. These regions are located along the Senegal River, which forms the border between Senegal and Mauritania. This river is essential to agricultural production in these regions as it allows the practice of irrigation. Most of the 110,000 inhabitants of the three rural communities considered in the survey derive their livelihoods from farming. They generally cultivate rice, tomato and onion for income, and to a small extent for their own consumption, which is complemented with several other food crops (sweet potato, corn, mango, millet, eggplant, gumbo, bean, chili pepper).

Although it is difficult to estimate the exact revenues women derive from the sale of their product because they do not keep a record of the various transactions in which they are involved, I estimate that they earn between $75 and $150 per season, with some women making considerably more. What is significant, however, is that women unanimously believe their work to be profitable and well worth pursuing. With the earnings they make, they buy clothing for themselves and their children, necessary items for their kitchen, and rice for the daily meals, and also pay for the schooling of their numerous offspring. It should also be noted that onions, cabbage, and tomatoes, when not sold because they are slightly spoiled or insect-damaged, are consumed by members of the producer’s household or fed to their domestic animals. Hence, women’s gardens also nourish the family.	From past to future agricultural expertise in Africa: Jola women of Senegal expand market-gardening	Olga F. Linares	2009

Surfaces covered with rice fields are smaller than they once were , and those that are cultivated do not always yield more than , at most , 1,200 kg of rice per hectare .		n	In most Jola areas, then, the rice-growing system is in decline. Surfaces covered with rice fields are smaller than they once were, and those that are cultivated do not always yield more than, at most, 1,200 kg of rice per hectare. Upland crops such as millet and sorghum are being replaced by manioc, which is tolerant of dry conditions but not very nutritious; and maize, which is more nourishing but vulnerable to pests. In some other regions, groundnut cultivation is also contracting, bringing less monetary revenue to the household. Obviously, conditions are not the same everywhere, but, overall, traditional crops are not doing as well as before, and families are poorer and less well fed. For these reasons, it is imperative for the Jola people to find new ways to intensify agriculture and raise productivity. In these efforts, women are bound to play an important role, as they indeed do in all other agricultural activities.

In a study by Cechin and Press ( 1994 ) , rice plants infected with S. hermonthica did not produce any grain .		n	Striga spp. (witchweeds) are annual, obligate hemiparasitic weeds on tropical cereal crops like maize, sorghum, and rice. Despite the presence of chlorophyll and photosynthetically active leaves (Press et al., 1991), these parasitic plants can severely reduce growth and development of the infected host plant. They parasitize host roots through a xylem-to-xylem connection made by a special organ, the haustorium (Parker and Riches, 1993). Through this connection, the parasite subtracts host-plant metabolites, water, nutrients, and amino acids (e.g., Press et al., 1987; Rogers and Nelson, 1962) and alters the hormone balance (Drennan and El Hiweris, 1979; Frost et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1996). Most of the studies showing these effects have been conducted with C4 hosts (e.g., sorghum and maize), but similar interactions are expected with C3 hosts such as rice.

Farm effects are captured by the farm dummy fk and year effects by the time dummy tm .		n	Many functional forms for production functions are possible. In the literature, flexible functional forms such as the translog, leontief or quadratic production functions are preferred because they do not put too much restrictions across effects and have sufficient parameters to represent comparative statics at a point (Anderson et al., 1996). This study adopts the traditional Cobb-Douglas (CD) specification however due to its ease of estimation and because flexible forms require many observations due to the large amount of model parameters, which reduces the degrees of freedom of the model substantially. Due to the panel structure of the dataset, fixed farm and time effects were included in the production function; their inclusion was concluded to be essential by Carpentier and Weaver (1997).

Although marketed surplus is still a relatively small portion of total production, farmer sales are expected to increase as the area under irrigation expands and average landholdings increase. The evidence suggests that unauthorized marketing activity is virtually impossible to suppress as long as there are profit opportunities for private traders, which is likely as long as a uniform pricing structure remains in place and/or as long as official marketing margins reflect costs incurred by the inefficient state grain marketing organizations.

One application per year of 26 kg P ha-1 supplied by the recommended dose of NPK fertilizer seemed to provide enough P for two seasons .		n	Considering our research hypothesis, it was particularly interesting to note that all the nine FMOs produced similar yields (no significant difference) during the four cropping seasons at the two sites. Even the application of N fertilizer alone (FMO2, FMO3, FMO8, and FMO9) produced similar yields compared to the recommended NPK (FMO1). Otherwise, N fertilizer should be ~ 35 ~ applied each season but P and K nutrients could be applied in one season per year without any yield reduction. One application per year of 26 kg P ha-1 supplied by the recommended dose of NPK fertilizer seemed to provide enough P for two seasons. Investigating the importance of soil extractable P on rice yield, Bado et al. (2007) determined a critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1 (Bray 1 P). P becomes a limiting factor for increasing rice yield when the soil supplies less than 9 mg P kg-1 and P fertilizer should be applied under such conditions in order to increase rice yields. Above this value, responses to P fertilizer applications are not expected (Bado et al., 2007). Data of soil extractable P should be used to confirm the necessity to apply P fertilizers to overcome this limiting factor. However, the values of 7.5 and 8.2 mg P kg-1 at the two sites were very close to the critical limit (9 mg P-Bray1 kg-1). The recommended dose of NPK that supplies 26 kg P ha-1 seems to provide enough P to maintain soil extractable P around or beyond the critical limit. This can explain why one application of 26 kg P ha-1 per season can maintain good levels of soil extractable P and rice yields for two cropping seasons as we observed at the two sites. Based on our data, this is true when soil extractable P is very close to the critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1.

It analyzes how innovation in quality makes transactions complex, and influences the power relationships between the driver of the chain and its suppliers. Included suppliers may be upgraded, that is to say may acquire new skills and access more remunerative markets (Humphrey, 2004). On the contrary, producers who do not meet the criteria for inclusion may be marginalized from pro-poor processes (Maertens and Swinnen, 2009).

However, in the case of the 1999 flooding evaluated based on a 30-years return period by Henny (2012), peak flow rates of the upper boundary at Podor should be constrained to less than 1800 [t/s], because the simulation result indicated that flooding may occur if this flow rates are exceeded. As shown in Figure 4, the storage capacity of Lake R’kiz is too small to prevent flooding. As an alternative, we suggest cooperative flooding control utilizing both Lake R’kiz and another reservoir. There are several small natural reservoirs along the Senegal River. Especially, near the confluence point, a large reservoir named Kundi exists and could be used to better control potential for flooding. In addition, the growth stages of rice should be considered for optimum flooding control. Kotera et al. (2016) demonstrated that rice yields are significantly damaged by submergence when submergence occurs during the flowering stage of rice. Moreover, before harvest season, paddy fields need to be dried in order to use a harvester. In Mauritania, the middle to end of October, and the beginning of November correspond to flowering and drainage stages, respectively. Thus, flood damage should be controlled during these periods to maintain stable rice yields. 4.3 Consideration of water use for irrigation in the dry season Conveyance to Lake R’kiz affects not only flooding control but also water use. According to its estimated storage capacity, approximately 326 million tons of water could be stored. This water resource has the potential to allow cultivation of approximately 27,200 ha based on the 5 mm per day of water requirement of a paddy field growing rice for eight months each year.

In the literature, flexible functional forms such as the translog, leontief or quadratic production functions are preferred because they do not put too much restrictions across effects and have sufficient parameters to represent comparative statics at a point (Anderson et al., 1996). This study adopts the traditional Cobb-Douglas (CD) specification however due to its ease of estimation and because flexible forms require many observations due to the large amount of model parameters, which reduces the degrees of freedom of the model substantially. Due to the panel structure of the dataset, fixed farm and time effects were included in the production function; their inclusion was concluded to be essential by Carpentier and Weaver (1997). The mathematical specification of the loglinear form of the production function is: ln ln    ln (1) where α, βi, fk and tm are parameters to be estimated. The arguments Xi are the productive inputs, with i = 1 (land), 2 (seed), 3 (labor), 4 (fertilizer), 5 (irrigation costs).

Therefore , for better rice quality and performance of the ASI , a thresher training program could be provided to operators to enable permanent adaptation / refinement of the machine .		n	This performance, viewed through the perspective of different options representing the RICM, can be attributed to improved technologies developed by AfricaRice and its partners in the mid-1990s (Kebbeh and Miézan 2003). Before the year 2000, the average yield in the SRV was around 4 tonnes ha –1 (SAED 2008). The ASI thresher is perceived by farmers as a moderately to highly time and labor saving technology with low to moderate grain recovery performance (Table 1). However, farmers were more concerned with the moderate grain quality achieved and the relatively modest number of machines available in the region. During the survey period, some 23–50% of farmers were not satisfied with the quality of private service operators and expressed the need for improving the performance of ASI threshing services. Therefore, for better rice quality and performance of the ASI, a thresher training program could be provided to operators to enable permanent adaptation/refinement of the machine.

Data were analyzed using a mixed ANOVA model, using the REML option in JMP 8.0.2 (SAS institute Inc., San Francisco). Focus group data were interpreted using Verifiable Analysis (Krueger and Casey, 2009). We also constructed crop management budgets with each farmer using data collected from their field sheets and in focus groups. Irrigation, tillage, seed and agro-chemical costs included a 5.6% increase representing credit interest fees. After careful consultation with participating farmers, extension agents and women involved in transplanting and weeding activities, we valued tasks performed by women or children at 50% the opportunity cost for an 8-h day of adult male labor. Small-scale equipment amortization costs were negligible compared to total expenses; we therefore assumed them to be sunk. Following local practices, harvesting labor was valued at a fixed rate. Threshing in the region is not paid monetarily; instead, farmers are charged in rice at a rate of 10% threshed grain. Yields were adjusted accordingly, and the remaining rice was valued at 0.21 € kg 1 and 0.19 € kg 1 in the 2008 wet and 2009 dry seasons. A fixed exchange rate of €1 = 656 FCFA was employed for each season.	Improving irrigated rice production in the Senegal River Valley through experiential learning and innovation	Timothy J.

Faced with excess capacity , most larger mills both started to grow their own rice and also directly contracted with farmers , in some cases supplying inputs in advance .		n	As a result of these efforts, large milling capacity increased to 155,000 mt at the end of the 2013–2014 season as compared with production of around 332,731 mt. Thus large mills could cover around half of the processing, although in reality they are covering somewhere between one-eighth and one-quarter as farmers continue to prefer working with the small décortiqueses. Faced with excess capacity, most larger mills both started to grow their own rice and also directly contracted with farmers, in some cases supplying inputs in advance. For example, one mill in Caoumba produces 1,000 ha of its own rice and finances a network of 13,000 farmers producing on 7,000 ha. Nonetheless, it appears that many farmers still find it more profitable or preferable to use local décortiqueses, possibly because transport and storage costs are lower or because they can process rice in small batches as they need income over the course of the year.

Thus by estimating a production function with an embedded DA function , farm level bird damage estimates can be obtained by feeding the loss function with observed pest control levels .		n	The DA literature arose from publications about pesticide productivity and has mainly focused on the correct specification of the production function. In the traditional production function specification, , all inputs X are treated symmetrically, i.e. they are assumed to contribute to production in the same way. Lichtenberg and Zilberman (1986) criticized this specification by proposing an asymmetrical specification that treats productive inputs X and damage abating inputs Z differently. Their rationale behind this is that damage abating inputs are not standard factors of production that directly increase yield, but are damage control agents which indirectly mitigate yield loss through the elimination of pests. They define a specific function g(Z), the damage abatement function, to describe the DA inputs’ specific role in production: , . The DA function represents the percentage of damage that is eliminated by the use of the DA inputs Z and possesses the properties of a cumulative probability distribution: it is defined on the interval [0,1] with g = 0 meaning zero elimination of damage, g =1 denoting complete eradication of damage, it is a monotonically increasing function and g(Z)  1 when Z  ∞. A simple linear form of the asymmetric specification is     , where represents minimal output and potential output on which works as a scaling factor. Choosing minimal output equal to zero, this equation is reduced to   . This equation symbolizes that the DA production function approach is based on the damage abatement process that is multiplicatively separable from the production process: the DA function g(Z), representing the percentage of prevented damage, influences potential yield f(X) as a scaling factor. Following its definition, one minus the DA function represents the pest-inflicted loss function at various pest control levels. Thus by estimating a production function with an embedded DA function, farm level bird damage estimates can be obtained by feeding the loss function with observed pest control levels. Note that the DA function uses bird control efforts as an input to represent the abatement process; hence this approach uses bird control as a proxy to estimate bird damage.

In many locations, they are the key place where consumers are exposed to information and products that shape food preferences and ultimately choices (Clary et al. 2017). “Markets and other economic institutions do more than just allocate goods and services; they also influence the evolution of values, tastes and personalities” (Bowles 1998). Studies analyzing the challenges facing local rice in urban markets indicate that local rice has a poor market share as it Is perceived as being of inferior quality; however it also has a lower price, certainly of interest to poorer consumers (Faimohe et al. 2018). Policies are needed that explicitly seek to maintain a diversity of rice on the market, of both high quality and broken rice markets, for different consumers, and rice reflecting local consumers’ preference. Various policy measures proposed include encouraging investment in quality upgrading, imposing tariffs to increase the cost-competitiveness of West African rice relative to imported rice, while still leaving open the market windows for low-cost, broken rice markets.

The inland valleys comprise a huge production potential that is yet underexploited .		n	Weed research for rice systems in Africa may focus more on rain-fed and semi-irrigated lowland ecosystems (inland valleys) where flooding cannot, or only partially, be controlled. The inland valleys comprise a huge production potential that is yet underexploited. In these areas, weeds are a major constraint as water control is poor, and the soil is fertile and either wet or moist for much of the year. Rice production in the inland valleys is mainly for subsistence (Windmeijer and Andriesse, 1993). Land preparation is mostly done by hand and fields are often inadequately bunded and leveled resulting in uneven flooding and patchy conditions favoring weed growth (Akobundu and Fagade, 1978; Ampong-Nyarko, 1996). Uncontrolled flooding also 198 J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson renders the use of herbicides less effective (Akobundu, 1987). The lack of a permanent and adjustable water layer favors weed infestations, such as observed with wild rice in Tanzania (Riches et al., 2005), and leads to severe crop–weed competition. Few suitable weed control technologies are yet available for farmers in these rice production ecosystems and developing these should be a priority. Rice production in inland valleys is considered very suitable for integrated management approaches.	Weed Management in Rice-Based Cropping Systems in Africa	J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson	2009

The scheme is ambitious and there are challenges .		n	The Compagnie Agricole de Saint Louis (CASL) is aiming to partially address this burden, however, by producing rice on a large scale in the Senegal River delta, putting arable land to use and creating the conditions to eventually mill and store up to 60 000 tonnes of rice per year. In addition to producing paddy rice, CASL will also buy it from local farmers and employ local people to operate and maintain the large farm and rice mill. The scheme is ambitious and there are challenges. Rice plants are living things, and this is not like producing a good in a factory. “We are subject to the wind and the rain,” says CASL CEO Laurent Nicolas. “You could say that in our case the factory has no roof and no walls. Farming is hard, and on this scale it requires a lot of organisation and a lot of logistics.” Laurent Nicolas, CEO of CASL Although not yet close to full speed and capacity, the project is already having a positive impact on its surrounding area. New irrigation infrastructure is giving local farmers the chance to cultivate rice on plots which previously lacked this irrigation, and produce two rice harvests per year, in addition to providing water for other crops.

The GOANA aims at reaching rice self-sufficiency in Senegal by 2015 ( FTF 2010 ; SAED 2008 ) .		n	However, more than a decade later we still know very little about its impact on farmers’ livelihoods and the sustainability of its performances. Early experimental studies have shown evidence of its superior technical performance (Kanté 1997) and financial profitability (Donovan and Douthwaite 1997) and recently, Diagne et al. (2013) have found that the ASI thresher-cleaner significantly increases technical efficiency of irrigated rice production. Our study focuses on an observational approach of impact assessment with the application of the causal or treatment effect framework from the perspective of modern evaluation theory (Diagne and Demont 2007; Imbens and Wooldridge 2009). First, the consistent adoption rate of the ASI thresher and its determinants are estimated to assist mainly in the development of strategic and steering programs for future investment in small-farm equipment in the SRV. Second, the impact of the ASI thresher on threshing labor and time is assessed through Matching approaches/parameters. Adoption of a technology is motivated by its impact on profits and labor saving is the primary motivation for mechanical threshing (Pingali 2007), The coexistence of rice and vegetable growing in the SRV leads to frequent shortage of labor during rice harvest and post-harvest periods when the labor requirement peaks for these operations and then cycles into a further labor peak for transplanting of vegetable crops at the end of the wet season. The adoption of the ASI thresher is a priori expected to decrease the amount of labor needed and to save time for threshing activity. A consequence of adopting the ASI thresher is lower pressure from the calendar constraints of irrigated rice cultivation which can ease sufficiently to accommodate double-cropping as recommended in the Senegalese Great Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance (GOANA) program. The GOANA aims at reaching rice self-sufficiency in Senegal by 2015 (FTF 2010; SAED 2008). Senegal is the third-largest rice importer in Africa, after Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire (USDA 2011; USDA 2012) and, along with many other African countries, was heavily hit by the world rice crisis in 2007–2008.

Social conservatism can limit the emergence of MOs , at a net social cost for the community ( Hoff & Sen , 2006 ; Kuran , 1988 ) .		n	One way of explaining the positive role of social heterogeneity on the presence of MOs is to consider heterogeneity as an indicator of lesser community pressures against individualized benefits. According to this interpretation, more social homogeneity proxies the importance of sharing norms widespread in West-African villages. More rainfall variability proxies the need for mutual insurance in response to greater risk. Because they do not directly generate monetary revenues for their members, COs do not induce economic differentiation of their members from the rest of the community. To the contrary, by providing support to local entrepreneurship, MOs are expected to induce economic and social differentiation of their members from the rest of the community. Because this may jeopardize the traditional structures of authority as well as the mutual insurance system within the community, the community will often resist the emergence of MOs (Fafchamps, 1992; Platteau, 2000). Therefore more social pressures to share (proxied by more social homogeneity) and more rainfall variability (representing the need for more sharing) can be expected to constrain the emergence of MOs. Social conservatism can limit the emergence of MOs, at a net social cost for the community (Hoff & Sen, 2006; Kuran, 1988).	Do Village Organizations Make a Difference in African Rural Development?

Yet their commercial incentives are aligned towards minimizing risk at the expense of realizing maximum revenues and win-win relationships with private buyers .		n	The majority of irrigated rice smallholders demonstrate a similar orientation towards subsistence behaviors. The main difference, however, is the uniformly high level of upgrading that has already occurred. With decades of intensive governmental support, these producers have achieved high levels of production knowledge, skills and practices that generate consistently high yields and marketable surpluses. Yet their commercial incentives are aligned towards minimizing risk at the expense of realizing maximum revenues and win-win relationships with private buyers. They are likely to invest in better commercial strategies if they can find new ways of managing risk, both within their household and within their farming enterprise, that are consistent with the risk-sharing motivations of the private sector.

The observed differences within COs in Table 9 may then be attributed to different mix of poverty levels across organizations .		n	We test this hypothesis by calculating for each organization the proportion of all members who are said to have benefited from the organization they belong to, along with the separate proportions for leaders and non-leaders within the organization. Contrasting the appropriation of benefits between leaders and non-leaders shows the remarkable ability of bureaucratic procedures in holding in check potential abuse of leadership. Leaders do not derive differential benefits from MOs compared to other members. In COs, we see that leaders derive less benefits than other members in Senegal. While there may be a bias in reporting, we were frequently told in case studies that leaders are cautious in not being served first not to jeopardize their leadership positions. The observed differences within COs in Table 9 may then be attributed to different mix of poverty levels across organizations. Systematically associating resource management by local organizations with elite capture, as done in much of the literature on decentralization and participation, can be quite misleading. Here, the issue is less capture and corruption than low management capacity and lack of access to resources.	Do Village Organizations Make a Difference in African Rural Development?

Limited recent evidence is available however on the impact of birds on cereals in Africa. Yet, before a functional foundation for future control strategies can be designed, accurate estimates of the crop losses inflicted by the pest are needed. This study contributes by presenting and comparing both econometrically estimated and perceived bird damage estimates. These estimates provide timely information for farmers and policy makers in the Senegal River Valley (SRV), who are currently struggling to implement an ambitious self-sufficiency program. Methodologicalwise, a damage abatement (DA) production function analysis was successfully carried out and compared to a classical Cobb-Douglas production function approach. This study points out that the asymmetric DA specification which includes pest pressure information performs better than the traditional symmetric Cobb-Douglas specification, the latter resulting in counterintuitive results.

The GPGPU was developed based on the graphics board found in many computers, and has already been applied in a previous study using a CFD simulation based on the 2-dimensional shallow-water equation. In the previous study, the GPGPU improved the computational time and the accuracy of the simulation for a fine-grid DEM (Zeng et al., 2013). Based on this study, 30 m of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data was considered in our CFD simulation using the GPGPU. In this simulation, 170 canals, roads, and tributaries were considered in the simulation.

To avoid this, we tried to employ a General Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU), which is a parallel computing unit. The GPGPU was developed based on the graphics board found in many computers, and has already been applied in a previous study using a CFD simulation based on the 2-dimensional shallow-water equation. In the previous study, the GPGPU improved the computational time and the accuracy of the simulation for a fine-grid DEM (Zeng et al., 2013). Based on this study, 30 m of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data was considered in our CFD simulation using the GPGPU. In this simulation, 170 canals, roads, and tributaries were considered in the simulation. Figure 8 shows the result of the simulation with GPGPU, which significantly improved the simulation’s accuracy when compared to the images in Figure 6.

Incentives and the Business Case The success in helping farmers adopt GAPs and in getting other value chain actors to adopt new innovations is clearly linked to the fact that adopting these innovations has been profitable for several key actors. This includes seed multipliers, rice farmers, and (to a lesser extent) rice processors. Both seed multipliers and rice farmers have very solid returns on investment, especially given current international and domestic rice prices and subsidies on inputs. While some rice processors are clearly doing well and making money, the inability of others to find adequate supplies of rice suggests that many farmers still find it more profitable or preferable to use local décortiqueses.

In some other regions , groundnut cultivation is also contracting , bringing less monetary revenue to the household .		n	In most Jola areas, then, the rice-growing system is in decline. Surfaces covered with rice fields are smaller than they once were, and those that are cultivated do not always yield more than, at most, 1,200 kg of rice per hectare. Upland crops such as millet and sorghum are being replaced by manioc, which is tolerant of dry conditions but not very nutritious; and maize, which is more nourishing but vulnerable to pests. In some other regions, groundnut cultivation is also contracting, bringing less monetary revenue to the household. Obviously, conditions are not the same everywhere, but, overall, traditional crops are not doing as well as before, and families are poorer and less well fed. For these reasons, it is imperative for the Jola people to find new ways to intensify agriculture and raise productivity. In these efforts, women are bound to play an important role, as they indeed do in all other agricultural activities.

Therefore the question is what is the potential on the supply side ?		n	Given the challenges present with rainfed rice, this study was confined to the scaling up potential in the SRV. Demand for rice is clearly not an issue, given that there is huge potential for import substitution in the rice market in Senegal and the GOS is committed to controlling imports and prices, as necessary, to ensure the profitability of domestic production. Therefore the question is what is the potential on the supply side? Supply is largely constrained by how much irrigated land there is (i.e., irrigation infrastructure). Currently around 60,000 ha have access to irrigation for growing rice. It is difficult to get a precise estimate of how much additional land already has irrigation infrastructure in place that needs to be rehabilitated, and how much new land could be utilized. According to interviews, SAED personnel believe that up to an additional 60,000 ha could be rehabilitated. According to an interview with the head of the PNAR and other sources,40 the total potential in the SRV is 240,000 ha.

The irrigation project will divide the entire area into irrigated plots, eliminating the possibility of keeping large herds in this area during the crucial dry season. The deal MCA-Mali is proposing to the pastoralists is to allocate five hectare plots to each household.

The two hectare plots ‘given’ to local households will be used as loan collateral for the purchase of the other three (Grain 2010). The pastoralists are expected to pay US$5775 to US$7700 per hectare (Oakland Institute 2011, p. 21). To put this breathtaking price in perspective, one must realise that farm workers’ wages in this area can be as low as US$1.00 to US$1.50 per day (Oakland Institute 2011, p. 31).

Irrigated rice production Residue management Current status: After harvest of the rice grains, rice straw remains in the field as residue. In the Senegal River Valley, 80 percent of the rice straw residues are burned. A reason for the burning of rice straw is that cattle are wandering around rice fields, releasing their dung in the fields. As dung contains seeds, cattle are seen as a major vector for dissemination of wild rice (which is considered as weed). Straw residues are burned, so cattle do not spend too much time in the field grazing on these residues. The remaining 20 percent of the rice straw residues are either fed to animals or buried in the field as fertilizer. A different situation happens in the Casamance region, where almost no rice straw is burned. The residues are either left in the field for grazing or the straw is buried to improve soil fertility. Burning rice straw in the field can emit substantial amounts of air pollutants, which has a negative impact on the environment and human health (Bogdanski et al. 2016).

In these areas , weeds are a major constraint as water control is poor , and the soil is fertile and either wet or moist for much of the year .		n	Weed research for rice systems in Africa may focus more on rain-fed and semi-irrigated lowland ecosystems (inland valleys) where flooding cannot, or only partially, be controlled. The inland valleys comprise a huge production potential that is yet underexploited. In these areas, weeds are a major constraint as water control is poor, and the soil is fertile and either wet or moist for much of the year. Rice production in the inland valleys is mainly for subsistence (Windmeijer and Andriesse, 1993). Land preparation is mostly done by hand and fields are often inadequately bunded and leveled resulting in uneven flooding and patchy conditions favoring weed growth (Akobundu and Fagade, 1978; Ampong-Nyarko, 1996). Uncontrolled flooding also 198 J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson renders the use of herbicides less effective (Akobundu, 1987). The lack of a permanent and adjustable water layer favors weed infestations, such as observed with wild rice in Tanzania (Riches et al., 2005), and leads to severe crop–weed competition. Few suitable weed control technologies are yet available for farmers in these rice production ecosystems and developing these should be a priority. Rice production in inland valleys is considered very suitable for integrated management approaches.	Weed Management in Rice-Based Cropping Systems in Africa	J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson	2009

In some area , paddy fields near the water course are adjacent to “ marigot ” , small stream of the end of tributaries or back water .		n	Toposequence of the rice cultivation area in the Lower Casamance is as follows. Red brown upland soils develop under the forests in the highest land, and palm trees are grown from the edge of the forests down to the edge of upper slopes where red brown to light yellow brown soils develop. On the upper slopes where gray soils develop, upland rice is grown and/or nursery is prepared1. Soils of the successive upper slope are relatively of hydro-morphic, and utilized for the rainfed paddy cultivation which depends on groundwater. However, the growth of paddy is unstable due to the decreased groundwater level resulting from the decrease in rainfall. On the middle slopes is the best rice cultivation area where water is usually sufficiently available and no fear of salinity hazard or acid toxicity. Near the water course, saline contents increase rapidly, which often results in standing dead after transplanting, but as soil fertility is high, the highest yield is expected when sufficient rainfall is obtained2. Beyond this where marshy land extends, soils are called “tanne”, showing very low pH with high salinity. In particular, bared “tanne” has the highest salt content, which sometimes becomes salt pan in the dry season3. On the mangrove area, where pH increases, young alluvium with high organic matter content is deposited. In some area, paddy fields near the water course are adjacent to “marigot”, small stream of the end of tributaries or back water. 4. Overview of rice cultivation (1) Farming practice In the Lower Casamance area, transplanting is a common practice. Nursery is prepared by burning trees near the rainfed paddy field, or utilizing a part of paddy field in case of flat lowland, at the beginning of rainy season, in early to mid-July. Sowing and transplanting is done when rainfall stabilizes, which tends to delay nursery work and prolong nursery period, resulting in weak and poor seedlings when transplanted. Land preparation and weeding is done from early August to early September when the paddy field starts to be submerged.

Compound fields surround homesteads , are cultivated permanently , receive various amounts of amendments from rubbish heaps or livestock pens , and are typically planted with cereals , vegetables , and fruit trees .		n	Farmers distinguish two soil types, known as joor and deg. The former is an Entisol, a tropical soil with high iron content and low organic matter. The second is an Alfisol, which is more weathered and has higher clay, silt, and organic matter content. Local farming systems include a mix of compound and bush fields cultivated by rural households. Compound fields surround homesteads, are cultivated permanently, receive various amounts of amendments from rubbish heaps or livestock pens, and are typically planted with cereals, vegetables, and fruit trees. Bush fields are located at some distance from homesteads (ranging from 0.5 km to a few kilometers), and may be differentiated into upland or lowland fields, suitable to a variety of crops, such as millet, maize, groundnut or maize. They receive less input than the compound fields. In both communities, the main crops are millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Farmers in Bacfassagal also produce sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), which are often intercropped with millet or peanut. In Paoskoto, wetter conditions allow farmers to produce maize, especially early-maturing varieties (the most popular one is an 80-day variety known as Early Thai). Rainfed rice (Oryza sativa) is also cultivated in valley bottoms and some farmers grow water melon and pumpkin in compound plots. In both communities, farmers usually plant millet prior to the rain, applying varying amounts of organic manure and, sometimes, chemical fertilizers. Peanut and maize are generally sown after a few big rains when farmers believe that the rainy season has really started. In Paoskoto, farmers tend to use fertilizers and pesticides on peanut and maize, though they mentioned the high price of chemical inputs as a constraint.

Another way to improve quality is to speed up the drying process of paddy rice .		n	The first challenge is how to produce the quality and type of rice that urban consumers want to buy. Problems related to improving quality seem not to be insurmountable, as they are not inherent to the country or the production system as such. Rather the main problems are due to poor processing, which does not conform to consumer preferences. Currently the largest share of local production passes through small informal mills at the village level, which are unable to sort the rice mechanically or to remove foreign matter. Policies should stimulate private investments in improved processing and sorting of rice. Another way to improve quality is to speed up the drying process of paddy rice. Due to poor storage facilities, rice often is not dried quickly enough, which reduces quality or may even cause the rice to rot.

Glyphosate, a herbicide used in land preparation for rice, is effective against O. longistaminata and O. barthii as preemergence treatment (Davies, 1984; Riches et al., 2005). Propanil is a popular herbicide for use in tank mixtures and, for example, one of the most frequently used combinations in rice production schemes of the Senegal River Valley is propanil and 2,4-D + dichlorprop (e.g., Haefele et al., 2000). Postemergence applications of propanil mixed with piperophos (Imeokparia, 1994), molinate (Babiker, 1982), thiobencarb, fluorodifen, or oxadiazon (Akobundu, 1981; Okafor, 1986) proved successful in irrigated rice in various other African countries. In irrigated direct-seeded rice, good weed control was obtainedwith preemergence applications of dymrone or thiobencarb in the Lake Chad Basin in Nigeria (Okafor, 1986), and bifenox or oxadiazon in Sudan (Babiker, 1982). In upland rice in Nigeria, good weed control has been reported by using mixtures of pretilachor with dimethametryne and piperophos with cinosulfuron (Enyinnia, 1992; Ishaya et al., 2007). Chemical weed control is best used in conjunctions with other weedmanagement components within an IWM approach (Rijn, 2001). In this respect, however, herbicides may not lend themselves to be combined with other practices such as mixed cropping systems (Akobundu and Fagade, 1978) or biological pest control (e.g., Afun et al., 1999b; Taylor et al., 2006).

Data of soil extractable P should be used to confirm the necessity to apply P fertilizers to overcome this limiting factor .		n	Considering our research hypothesis, it was particularly interesting to note that all the nine FMOs produced similar yields (no significant difference) during the four cropping seasons at the two sites. Even the application of N fertilizer alone (FMO2, FMO3, FMO8, and FMO9) produced similar yields compared to the recommended NPK (FMO1). Otherwise, N fertilizer should be ~ 35 ~ applied each season but P and K nutrients could be applied in one season per year without any yield reduction. One application per year of 26 kg P ha-1 supplied by the recommended dose of NPK fertilizer seemed to provide enough P for two seasons. Investigating the importance of soil extractable P on rice yield, Bado et al. (2007) determined a critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1 (Bray 1 P). P becomes a limiting factor for increasing rice yield when the soil supplies less than 9 mg P kg-1 and P fertilizer should be applied under such conditions in order to increase rice yields. Above this value, responses to P fertilizer applications are not expected (Bado et al., 2007). Data of soil extractable P should be used to confirm the necessity to apply P fertilizers to overcome this limiting factor. However, the values of 7.5 and 8.2 mg P kg-1 at the two sites were very close to the critical limit (9 mg P-Bray1 kg-1). The recommended dose of NPK that supplies 26 kg P ha-1 seems to provide enough P to maintain soil extractable P around or beyond the critical limit. This can explain why one application of 26 kg P ha-1 per season can maintain good levels of soil extractable P and rice yields for two cropping seasons as we observed at the two sites. Based on our data, this is true when soil extractable P is very close to the critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1.

Farmer organizations do not negotiate marketing credit which would allow them to collect , transform and store all surplus rice production and advance some of the total sales revenue to farmers .		n	Table 4 also indicates the importance of farmer organizations in the commercial orientation of farmers. Farmer organizations usually only oversee the demand for credit and the distribution of inputs and irrigation water. Without personal funds or individual access to credit, it is necessary to be part of a farmer organization in order to be able to cultivate a significant area. Through facilitating access to credit and inputs, and thereby increasing production, union membership can enhance individual market participation, even when the farmer organizations usually do not arrange for the commercialization of surplus production. The main reason for the limited commercial activity of farmer organizations is the heterogeneity of producers. While some farmers are in urgent need of cash at the end of the season Chapter 12.

Farmer organizations do not negotiate marketing credit which would allow them to collect, transform and store all surplus rice production and advance some of the total sales revenue to farmers.

Thus , to evoke food and its evolution is also to evoke the memories associated with it by appealing to the senses .		n	While our estimations of both current and simulated-past diet might be prone to errors and bias, interviews with local actors about our results and comparison with literature about current and past diet in Sub-Saharan Africa indicated that our results were not too strongly affected by these errors and biases (see Method S1 in Online Supplementary Material for a more detailed discussion). Another question that arose in our work regarding diet has to be mentioned. While the kitchen space was clearly described by local women as a food space in continuity with the agricultural space where the sovereignty of women was exercised and where they expressed and improved a whole series of knowledge dishes (Fig. S4 in Result S1 in Online Supplementary Material), it would be desirable to continue investigations into the links between dishes and associated plants, all the more so since these are subjects that arouse great interest among women. We initiated this approach by starting with certain emblematic, such as preparations based on cowpeas or sorghum coucous (niri) whose consumption has fallen sharply due to lower production and higher purchase costs. Different preparations are associated with niri: niri Kosam (with milk), niri bouna (with dried fish) or niri beref. There are emblematic dishes, still prepared for certain occasions such as baptisms and weddings and associated with good health and culinary heritage. This study confirms, notably following Howard (2003), that culinary traditions are a major element in the preservation of wild and cultivated biodiversity. If culinary traditions are diminishing, the reasons for conserving these plants useful for food, as well as the knowledge associated with them (cultivation, processing, and storage) are also being lost. Thus, the work of women in the transmission of culinary knowledge is of great importance, and this makes the kitchen the primary place for maintaining biodiversity. In addition to being a place for conserving plants, the kitchen is also a place for creating emotions and memories. Thus, to evoke food and its evolution is also to evoke the memories associated with it by appealing to the senses.

Red brown upland soils develop under the forests in the highest land, and palm trees are grown from the edge of the forests down to the edge of upper slopes where red brown to light yellow brown soils develop. On the upper slopes where gray soils develop, upland rice is grown and/or nursery is prepared1. Soils of the successive upper slope are relatively of hydro-morphic, and utilized for the rainfed paddy cultivation which depends on groundwater. However, the growth of paddy is unstable due to the decreased groundwater level resulting from the decrease in rainfall. On the middle slopes is the best rice cultivation area where water is usually sufficiently available and no fear of salinity hazard or acid toxicity. Near the water course, saline contents increase rapidly, which often results in standing dead after transplanting, but as soil fertility is high, the highest yield is expected when sufficient rainfall is obtained2. Beyond this where marshy land extends, soils are called “tanne”, showing very low pH with high salinity. In particular, bared “tanne” has the highest salt content, which sometimes becomes salt pan in the dry season3. On the mangrove area, where pH increases, young alluvium with high organic matter content is deposited. In some area, paddy fields near the water course are adjacent to “marigot”, small stream of the end of tributaries or back water. 4. Overview of rice cultivation (1) Farming practice In the Lower Casamance area, transplanting is a common practice. Nursery is prepared by burning trees near the rainfed paddy field, or utilizing a part of paddy field in case of flat lowland, at the beginning of rainy season, in early to mid-July. Sowing and transplanting is done when rainfall stabilizes, which tends to delay nursery work and prolong nursery period, resulting in weak and poor seedlings when transplanted. Land preparation and weeding is done from early August to early September when the paddy field starts to be submerged.

Furthermore , there are many risks that require insurance coverage , and some of them such as civil security , are not usually covered .		n	I propose three recommendations to support the modernization of the domestic rice VC. The first recommendation is to carry out research to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. The implementation of an insurance system (started few years ago in Senegal) could prevent producer organizations unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. Nevertheless, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces several challenges. There are issues involving adverse selection and moral hazards that require costly information systems to be overcome. Furthermore, there are many risks that require insurance coverage, and some of them such as civil security, are not usually covered. Finally, certain risks such as climatic shocks may affect large areas, which may compromise the principle of solidarity among producers in the same region. Research projects are needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in the Senegal River valley, and to develop an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. There is a particular need to develop an information system on the risks, their magnitude and their effects on farmers. Similarly, production contracts could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who represent the highest risk of loan default. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the implicit insurance cost is determined, and how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic structure of the credit market and the lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the implicit rate of interest. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the inter-professional organization.

Surfaces covered with rice fields are smaller than they once were, and those that are cultivated do not always yield more than, at most, 1,200 kg of rice per hectare. Upland crops such as millet and sorghum are being replaced by manioc, which is tolerant of dry conditions but not very nutritious; and maize, which is more nourishing but vulnerable to pests. In some other regions, groundnut cultivation is also contracting, bringing less monetary revenue to the household. Obviously, conditions are not the same everywhere, but, overall, traditional crops are not doing as well as before, and families are poorer and less well fed. For these reasons, it is imperative for the Jola people to find new ways to intensify agriculture and raise productivity.

Sources believe that twenty-five to 30 percent of rice produced in the SRV is distributed to other cities and regions in Senegal.

He focused on changes of : crop cultivar , sowing date , harvest date , and use of fertilizers / manure and timing .		n	At the end of each sequence, that is, at the end of the rainy season, participants were asked to qualitatively estimate what they thought their yields would be given the practices they chose and the rainfall they received. This activity proved more challenging than expected, not always translating into consistent results. In some cases farmers’ claims that forecast use led to increased peanut yields were contradicted by their marks on the worksheet. In other cases, farmers did not change practices, but estimated their yields differently between the two rounds. Farmers’ yields assessments were, therefore, replaced by the appraisal of an agronomist from CERAAS/CIRAD (Centre International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) who has been working in the area for several years. For each field, each farmer and in each year, the agronomist compared the cropping activities by pairs (with and without forecast). He focused on changes of: crop cultivar, sowing date, harvest date, and use of fertilizers/manure and timing. He then compared these changes with the observed rainfall data to decide if they would have a positive, negative or null effect on yield. His assessment is therefore only relative. We detail in Table A4 the main changes reported by the experts for each category of impact (positive, null, negative) and in Table A5 three concrete examples of how he proceeded. This produced a database of 177 cases, with a case being defined as the comparison of round #1 and round #2 for a particular farmer, field, and year. While this approach has obvious limitations, it nonetheless provided an estimate of potential impact of forecast use relative to a wide range of cropping practices and rainfall conditions.

For T households, on average, the return is below cost for the western villages (1–3), positive for central villages 7–10 and zero for villages 11 and 12. The overall probability of recovering labor cost is 0.52, ranging from a small value of 0.07 in the western villages (1–3) to 0.96 for the central villages. When irrigated rice production at current yield levels and total costs is added to traditional cropping, the result for TI households is always a financial loss, although least in central villages 7–10, with the level of contribution from traditional cropping increasing from west to east as rainfall and productivity of rain fed crops increases. Average probability of recovering labor cost in TI households is 0.26, but almost zero in western villages where traditional agriculture has smallest productivity. By comparison, if infrastructure costs are ignored, TI households perform comparably to T households because under that condition (only inputs considered), the net benefit to irrigated cropping is close to zero. Overall for this scenario, the probability of recovering labor cost is 0.40 but is close to zero in the western villages (1–3) even though the net production ratio approaches unity (value of net production equals cost of labor).

The negotiation of the production contract price , with a specific breakdown of its components , should be an inherent focus of the interprofessional organization .		n	In the Senegal River valley, policies need to tackle the negative impact of the exclusion from the credit at the national bank on farmer income. They have two non-exclusive options. First, an insurance system that was introduced a few years ago in Senegal could prevent producer organizations that are unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. However, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces the challenges of adverse selection and moral hazards. Research is needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. Second, the production contract could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who present a higher risk of loan default. But it is not clear how the implicit interest and insurance costs are determined, or how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic market structure and lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the selling price. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the interprofessional organization.

Millet is far more drought resistant that other major staples as rice and sorghum, a critical characteristic to rural communities where soil fertility is poor and rains are unpredictable. Millet is currently grown on about 1 million hectares or one-third of Senegal’s arable land. In the Senegalese regions of Kaolack, Kaffrine and Fatick, where most of the country’s millet and peanut are grown, typically on sandy soil. Millet is interchanged with peanuts from one year to the next, a vital relationship as peanuts help to fix nitrogen in the soil. (GAIN 2011) Import vs. domestic production issues from a civil society perspective: The rice sector in Senegal does not seem to benefit from a good image. Rice cultivation is perceived to be ''too expensive'' because it requires, in large part, irrigation by pumping and mechanized tillage. Equipment is deteriorating and the practice of renewing or repairing needed equipment is not yet welldeveloped. The price of rice produced domestically is even not competitive compared to imported rice.

Despite the higher costs of production , especially energy to run irrigation pumps , rice production in saison chaud turned out to be more productive and profitable .		n	One of the other key takeaways from the effort to increase production was that many SRV rice farmers faced binding constraints on the land they could cultivate during the hivernale season and so increased the area cultivated during the saison chaud as an alternative. This led the total cultivated area, as reported in the official statistics, to increase from 27,792 ha in 2006–2007 to between 50,000 and 60,000 ha in 2008–2010. Of the increase of approximately 30,000 ha over that period, around twothirds were in saison chaud. The increase in area cultivated during the saison chaud allowed farmers and institutions like SAED to recognize more broadly what had long been true, namely that yields in the saison chaud were much greater than in hivernale, 1.25 to 1.65 mt/ha higher on average. Despite the higher costs of production, especially energy to run irrigation pumps, rice production in saison chaud turned out to be more productive and profitable. By 2009–2010 the share of saison chaud in total production had risen from 15 percent to between 35 and 45 percent, depending on the year. This was the state of play at the beginning of the scaling efforts led by PCE that started in 2010.

So, the originality and innovative nature of this project is threefold: 1. It was based on the definition of the research subject established in close collaboration with local NGOs, farmers’ organizations and the civil society; 2. It was linked to the deep nature of the academic TD effort implemented where the combination of social sciences and biotechnical science presented difficulties, both theoretical and practical; 3. It was crossed by a gender analysis that is not only focused on gender relations in the family and community but also concerned technical agricultural observations on biodiversity management and nutritionals records. The primary aim of this article is to give a multidimensional and comprehensive (relational) view of the consequences of the recent evolution of agriculture in Middle Senegal Valley. The dimensions considered are the cultivated biodiversity, the female agricultural and culinary activities, gender relations within the family and the nutritional quality of family food. The second aim is methodological: as we consider the DIVA project as an experiment in TD research, we make a reflexive return to what is at stake in terms of conception of research, methods and results’ analyses.

Women listed varieties of squash and pumpkin (called Déné Boudé) with yellow flesh (called Diayédjé), maize, cornilla (called niébé), and black rice (called Sarna or Maro Balléo, which was cultivated before the Nerica rice), wild grasses with small edible seeds (known locally as Pagguri, locally considered similar to fonio), fruit of the water lily, seeds of Nymphea lotus (called locally Ndayri), or bulb of Gladiolus sp. (Iridaceae locally called Dayeedji). However, the consumption of the previously mentioned species has decreased although some of them are still much appreciated foods, especially for their seeds (called Podé); they are available in the market. One woman explained: ‘The disappearing crops means that people stop eating these foods. Because if you don't grow them anymore, you have to buy them, so you don't prefer to buy them, because before you could get them for free, apart from the trouble of growing them’. Podé was one of the plants and associated dishes constantly evoked and considered as a culinary loss while it was alive in people’s memories. Cooking it is always a celebration: the choice to live in the villages, and sometimes in the concessions, made it possible to ask the families to cook the podé for us. This was an opportunity to measure the emotion involved in making this dish.

This category has no other source of credit and was thus unable to grow rice in the dry season of 2014 .		n	Rice producers in the SRV have several marketing options that they use and combine according to their livelihoods and perception of uncertainty. The main driver to participation in marketing and production contracts is the financial requirement of farms, mainly represented by the access of producer organizations to credit with the national bank. In Dagana Department, farmers growing rice are specialized and commercial banks are limited. The national bank is the main source of credit. Until 2010, when funded by this bank, farmers combined two types of spot transactions (including relational components): collective sales to repay the loan and individual sales to meet household’s needs. However, information imperfection and enforcement failure have led to low reimbursement levels and the bank has followed several recovery plans. Policies recently set up marketing contracts to secure the reimbursement of credit in addition to improving miller supplies. The bank promotes the use of marketing contracts. Producers allowed to use a credit at the bank are therefore more likely to participate in marketing contracts, especially when they perceive high uncertainty over access of credit, outlets and price fluctuations. On the contrary, producer organizations excluded from credit by the national bank have few financing options. Exclusion from credit at the national bank has therefore a positive influence on participation in production contracts when farms are within the activity radius of rice millers that make such agreements available. Therefore, the segmentation of the credit market is linked to the indebtedness of producers to the bank. The second driver that encourages producer organizations to participate in production contracts is the perception of uncertainty over delays in access to inputs and price fluctuations. There is also a category of producers which is specialized in rice growing, excluded from the national bank credit and located beyond the reach of rice millers offering production contracts. This category has no other source of credit and was thus unable to grow rice in the dry season of 2014.

However, with regard to the yield potential as mentioned above and within a context of availability of improved technologies, this performance could be considered as a technical regression. The highest average yield in our period of study was attained in 2004 and amounted to 5.88 t.ha−1 and the lowest in 2006, i.e. 4.04 t.ha−1. The year 2006 was particularly problematic because of the intensification of bird damage and disturbance of input supply (de Mey et al. 2012). Therefore, the maximum yields attained in this period varied from 9.01 to 12 t.ha−1 in our sample showing that the theoretical yield mentioned above can be attained at farm level.

However, in the case of the 1999 flooding evaluated based on a 30-years return period by Henny (2012), peak flow rates of the upper boundary at Podor should be constrained to less than 1800 [t/s], because the simulation result indicated that flooding may occur if this flow rates are exceeded. As shown in Figure 4, the storage capacity of Lake R’kiz is too small to prevent flooding. As an alternative, we suggest cooperative flooding control utilizing both Lake R’kiz and another reservoir. There are several small natural reservoirs along the Senegal River. Especially, near the confluence point, a large reservoir named Kundi exists and could be used to better control potential for flooding. In addition, the growth stages of rice should be considered for optimum flooding control. Kotera et al. (2016) demonstrated that rice yields are significantly damaged by submergence when submergence occurs during the flowering stage of rice. Moreover, before harvest season, paddy fields need to be dried in order to use a harvester. In Mauritania, the middle to end of October, and the beginning of November correspond to flowering and drainage stages, respectively. Thus, flood damage should be controlled during these periods to maintain stable rice yields. 4.3 Consideration of water use for irrigation in the dry season Conveyance to Lake R’kiz affects not only flooding control but also water use. According to its estimated storage capacity, approximately 326 million tons of water could be stored. This water resource has the potential to allow cultivation of approximately 27,200 ha based on the 5 mm per day of water requirement of a paddy field growing rice for eight months each year.

This involved a four-phase process (Fig. 3). In the first phase, farmers developed experience with RMP and SRI by managing a researcher-designed experiment. In the second phase, both researchers and farmers reflected upon crop management systems in focus group meetings, and through participatory labor quantification activities (see Dorward et al., 2007). Following the first season, we convened a meeting with farmers from all sites. Yield and labor quantification results were presented on poster boards using simple bar charts labeled in local languages and units. We then facilitated discussion and analysis of each crop management system (third phase). During this evaluation, we proposed testing a fourth crop management treatment employing what farmers considered as the most useful components of each management system. The last phase of the experiential learning process, active experimentation, was carried out during another two seasons in which farmers evaluated FAP against the other three practices. Following the final season’s harvests, semi-structured interviews were conducted with each farmer-participant to follow up on their impressions of the trials.

Clearly , when researching options for ntensification we should take into consideration the climate .		n	In irrigated areas an important question for breeders is whether hey should select for shorter duration varieties which would nable growing two or even three crops per year, or alternatively reed for medium/long duration varieties that yield more per indiidual crop but possibly restrict options for growing two or three rops per year. The same question is relevant for farmers, who ecide on what varieties to include in their crop rotations. The nswer to this question on short versus medium duration varieties epends on how many days exist within the year with a favourable limate. At high latitude locations only one crop may be possible er year because of low temperatures and low radiation levels in he colder half of the year. There, extending the length of the growng season of a single crop may have more prospects. Or, when a ield plateau is reached at a certain crop duration, an intensification ption is growing a vegetable crop or cover crop in autumn, after arvesting a winter cereal in summer. Moving closer to the equator he number of favourable days increases and so the choice between ingle/double/triple cereal cropping becomes more pertinent; all hree should be considered.

Although it is difficult to estimate the exact revenues women derive from the sale of their product because they do not keep a record of the various transactions in which they are involved, I estimate that they earn between $75 and $150 per season, with some women making considerably more. What is significant, however, is that women unanimously believe their work to be profitable and well worth pursuing. With the earnings they make, they buy clothing for themselves and their children, necessary items for their kitchen, and rice for the daily meals, and also pay for the schooling of their numerous offspring. It should also be noted that onions, cabbage, and tomatoes, when not sold because they are slightly spoiled or insect-damaged, are consumed by members of the producer’s household or fed to their domestic animals. Hence, women’s gardens also nourish the family.	From past to future agricultural expertise in Africa: Jola women of Senegal expand market-gardening	Olga F. Linares	2009

The SRV is the core area of rice production in Senegal. It provided 80% of domestic production in 2014 (USDA, 2015). Some 45,000 family farmers are involved in rice production in the SRV (Gergely and Baris, 2009). At the scale of the region of Saint Louis which includes Dagana Department, 39.5% of households were poor in 2010 (ANSD, 2010). And 16.1% of households in Dagana Department were affected by food insecurity (WFP, 2014). More information about the rice VC and the study area is given based on the requirements of the research questions addressed in each chapter. 25 Data are available at http://data.worldbank.org/ Rice is a politically strategic product in West Africa because it is a major contribution to national food security. Since independence, government strategies aim at supplying rice at low prices to the population. Certain researchers consider that there was an “urban bias” during the three last decades. Indeed, little support was given to agricultural production, and the strategy was to import cheap rice for urban consumers, who make up the main part of voters (Bezemer and Headey, 2008). Policies implemented after the price crisis also purport to supplying low-cost rice, but now through modernization of the domestic rice chain.

Doublecropping of rice, which requires readjustment of the standard cropping calendar, is considered in Senegal to be an important component of the national food self-sufficiency program known as the Great Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance (GOANA). The ASI rice thresher-cleaner, an improved post-harvest technology developed and released in 1997, aims to reduce post-harvest labor bottlenecks and increase the quality of grain from irrigated rice farming in the Senegal River Valley (SRV). Modern evaluation or treatment effect theory is applied in this paper to evaluate the adoption and impact of this improved post-harvest technology. Firstly, the adoption rate is estimated and its determinants are identified. The Average Treatment Effects (ATE) methodology for technology adoption is applied to obtain consistent estimates of the true population adoption rate. Secondly, the impact of ASI adoption on labor demand and time during threshing is estimated through the matching approaches. The results show that the ASI thresher helps irrigated rice farmers to cope with labor scarcity by decreasing significantly the amount of labor and time needed. The labor-gain is about seven to 10 man-days and threshing time reduced by two to four days per hectare. This labor saving significantly increases the potential for double cropping. The true ASI adoption rate would have been 86% if the entire population of irrigated rice farmers had been exposed to it. The socioeconomic characteristics that increase the probability to adopt the ASI thresher are farmer experience, farm size, participation in ASI field experiments and/or contact with service providers, and the lag between ASI invention and first awareness. Indeed, irrigated rice farmers who recently became aware of the ASI thresher represent a strong group of potential adopters.

Research projects are needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in the Senegal River valley , and to develop an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit .		n	I propose three recommendations to support the modernization of the domestic rice VC. The first recommendation is to carry out research to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. The implementation of an insurance system (started few years ago in Senegal) could prevent producer organizations unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. Nevertheless, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces several challenges. There are issues involving adverse selection and moral hazards that require costly information systems to be overcome. Furthermore, there are many risks that require insurance coverage, and some of them such as civil security, are not usually covered. Finally, certain risks such as climatic shocks may affect large areas, which may compromise the principle of solidarity among producers in the same region. Research projects are needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in the Senegal River valley, and to develop an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. There is a particular need to develop an information system on the risks, their magnitude and their effects on farmers. Similarly, production contracts could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who represent the highest risk of loan default. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the implicit insurance cost is determined, and how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic structure of the credit market and the lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the implicit rate of interest. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the inter-professional organization.

The main difference, however, is the uniformly high level of upgrading that has already occurred. With decades of intensive governmental support, these producers have achieved high levels of production knowledge, skills and practices that generate consistently high yields and marketable surpluses. Yet their commercial incentives are aligned towards minimizing risk at the expense of realizing maximum revenues and win-win relationships with private buyers. They are likely to invest in better commercial strategies if they can find new ways of managing risk, both within their household and within their farming enterprise, that are consistent with the risk-sharing motivations of the private sector.

A focus on mechanization in rice production concentrates on harvesting and post-production stages .		n	A focus on mechanization in rice production concentrates on harvesting and post-production stages. Traditionally rice is harvested manually with a knife, which is very labour intensive. Advocates for rice agribusiness argue for providing farmers with access to agricultural equipment for harvest and postharvest activities, oriented toward commercial large-scale production. Also, the possibility of increasing rice yields in the Senegal River Valley through double rice cropping, would be very much dependent on machinery availability (combine harvester and tractor). The number of such machines are limited; and the scope for maintenance is a major constraint. Once broken, they cannot be easily repaired locally, as most of the machines are imported with no spare parts. (Brosseau et al. 2018) In the Casamance area of Senegal, the smallholder traditional rice systems suffer from severe labor shortages as young men and women leave the countryside to find work in the cities. Linares (2009) notes that: “If Jola rice-growing systems are to avoid stagnation or gradual decline, serious efforts need to be made to mechanize agriculture. Unfortunately, however, this enormous task would require substantial financial and technical inputs that are well beyond the reach of the Senegalese state.” Thus for both conventional and agroecological rice systems, there is a need for greater investment in appropriate mechanization.

The increasing demand and consumption of rice in the region cut across the socioeconomic spectrum: from poor rural and urban households, to middle class households in urban areas. Among the 17 member states of the Africa Rice Center (WARDA), annual rice consumption per person nearly doubled during the last 25 years leading up to 1995, from 14.7 kg in 1970 to 25.1 kg in 1995. With current high population growth rates, it is realistic to expect rice demand in the region to continue increasing in the short to medium term. Although there have been moderate increases in rice production in the region, the growth rate in rice production has not kept up with increases in demand and consumption. The average annual growth rate for rice production between 1973 and 1993 was 5.2%, compared to an annual consumption growth rate of 6%.

The number of hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry season (36) as compared to the wet season (19). Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated for cold at the onset of the dry season by transplanting a higher number of seedlings per hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e. 3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season. Farmers explained that they prefer older seedlings because they are taller and can support higher levels of water in the field. However, older seedlings suffer from prolonged transplanting shock, reducing tillering capacity (Dingkuhn et al., 1990).	Determinants of irrigated rice yield in the Senegal River valley	J.C.

Around 80 percent of Senegal’s population is younger than 35. The droughts of the 1970s and 1980s impacted heavily on rural incomes, and one of the major consequences of this has been the flight of young men towards cities, where they seldom find jobs, leaving disproportionately large numbers of women in the countryside. Thus, a major challenge to agriculture in Senegal is to sustain the sector by increasing investment in farms, and to attract young people back, capable of absorbing the information needed to use new approaches, such as SRI (Seck et al. 2005). An essential component of this is ensuring land tenure rights to youth and women, as a fundamental basis for securing equity and building new, diverse socio-professional communities in the agriculture sector.

Globally , in irrigated plots of the Waalo , under the responsibility of the men , almost exclusively owners of the land , the women were carrying out different strategic tasks ( transplanting , weeding , guarding the cultivation against birds , harvesting ) for the production of rice , onions and tomatoes .		n	While there were different strategies of diversification, a clear gendered organization of agricultural work was observed (Table 2). Globally, in irrigated plots of the Waalo, under the responsibility of the men, almost exclusively owners of the land, the women were carrying out different strategic tasks (transplanting, weeding, guarding the cultivation against birds, harvesting) for the production of rice, onions and tomatoes. The new agro-system organization has created a novel female status, that of the ‘woman who helps’, which means she loses all family and social recognition. Even when migration kept young men absent and women were involved in many tasks, they very rarely gained recognition with strategic bodies (Top, 2014). When the lack of manpower made it necessary to make choices between crops in the irrigated Waalo or flood basins, the family choice gave priority to irrigated plots and rice that became strategic for the families’ food security and for earning money. The Waalo has thus lost its place as a feeding ground to irrigated areas, and to rice, which is now the staple food of the peasants. Sorghum, on the other hand, was becoming a cash crop for some families, who preferred to sell it when they grew it because: ‘The 50 kg bag is worth 30,000 FCFA for sorghum against 15,000 FCFA for rice.

Naatal Mbay , which in Wolof means “ flourishing agriculture , ” has yielded results .		n	Naatal Mbay, which in Wolof means “flourishing agriculture,” has yielded results. Since the project began, Senegal has more than doubled rice output, producing some 40 percent of domestic annual consumption. That impact is particularly evident in the Saint-Louis region of the Senegal River Valley, the fertile swath of land that straddles the country’s northern and eastern border with Mauritania. One of Naatal Mbay’s larger partners in the region is Maka Diama, a farmer network representing some 416 smallholders with approximately 400 hectares under cultivation. “Before working with Naatal Mbay, the farmers were producing about 4 tons of rice per hectare,” says Assane Diop, the network’s president. “Now, with higher quality fertilizer and certified seeds, it’s almost twice that amount.” Diop adds that the increased production owes in part to new GPS-enabled devices and training on their use. The devices, part of a suite of easy-to-use digital tools made available by Naatal Mbay, have helped farmers make precise measurements of their fields and, thus, more accurate estimates of the amount of seed and fertilizer needed for planting. Diop says one might assume that technological devices such as laptops have no place on a farm. “But the Garmin [GPS] is simple, and the information is important — not only for us but for the banks.” Sacks of rice for sale at a small roadside factory operated by Khar Yalla Gueye, a women’s association in Pont Gendarme, in the Saint-Louis region of Senegal.

Nonetheless , salinity at EC > 2 mS cm ÿ 1 seemed to mark the critical level for all varieties tested here .		n	In the present study, salinity was applied for only 14 days at varying levels during different, potentially salt sensitive developmental stages of the crop (Fageria, 1985) in order to simulate situations likely to arise under ®eld conditions. IKP and Sahel108 are widely grown in the Senegal River Delta. IKP is known for its yield stability and relative tolerance to salinity, whereas Sahel108 is well adapted to the Sahelian climate and has a high yield potential. IR31785, being considered for release to farmers in Senegal (WARDA, 2000), has a high yield potential but is extremely susceptible to salt. These characteristics are well re¯ected in our results. The analyses of the salinity effects on yield components in relation to ®nal yield indicate an adaptation strategy to salinity in IKP and Sahel108 as HI remains unchanged up to salinity levels of 5 mS cmÿ1 (Sahel108) and beyond (IKP) in the HDS accompanied by a reduction in yield by 30±40%. This supports the results of Asch et al. (2000b) who showed that salinity affects all plant organs in a similar way if permanent salt stress is applied. Nonetheless, salinity at EC >2 mS cmÿ1 seemed to mark the critical level for all varieties tested here. In both seasons and in all treatments, yield reductions were tolerable up to that EC value, except for IR31758 in WS. In summary it can be postulated, that regardless of the phenological stage of the crop in Sahelian environments at ¯oodwater salinity levels >2 mS cmÿ1, irrigation and drainage cycles are needed to reduce the salt load and to avoid yield losses. This is particularly important during the early reproductive stages of the crop.

These estimates provide timely information for farmers and policy makers in the Senegal River Valley ( SRV ) , who are currently struggling to implement an ambitious self-sufficiency program .		n	Granivorous birds, mainly the Red-billed Quelea, have subsisted on cereal crops in Africa for centuries and have caused substantial damage to agriculture. Limited recent evidence is available however on the impact of birds on cereals in Africa. Yet, before a functional foundation for future control strategies can be designed, accurate estimates of the crop losses inflicted by the pest are needed. This study contributes by presenting and comparing both econometrically estimated and perceived bird damage estimates. These estimates provide timely information for farmers and policy makers in the Senegal River Valley (SRV), who are currently struggling to implement an ambitious self-sufficiency program. Methodologicalwise, a damage abatement (DA) production function analysis was successfully carried out and compared to a classical Cobb-Douglas production function approach. This study points out that the asymmetric DA specification which includes pest pressure information performs better than the traditional symmetric Cobb-Douglas specification, the latter resulting in counterintuitive results.

This “Farmer Adapted System of Rice Intensification”, or FASRI, was subsequently compared to FP, RMP and ASRI in the 2008 wet season (WS08) and 2009 dry season (DS09). Weed biomass was sampled during these seasons from two randomly placed 50 cm2 quadrats plot-1 at ~15, 30-35 DAT, and booting. Herbicide use was measured by noting their volume and dilution of in backpack sprayers before and after application. Farmers were equipped with stopwatches to collect real-time labor data, and price information was gathered from a database maintained by AfricaRice (see Demont et al. 2009). Yields were analyzed by ANVOA for a RCBD using JMP 8.0.2 (SAS Inst., San Francisco); weed data were subjected to repeated measures ANOVA.

Such species merit further research attention. Weed research needs to focus on elucidating biology, taxonomy, and control measures of wild and weedy rices. In addition, to overcome problems of contaminated seed supplies, possibilities for the initiation of community-based seed systems should be investigated in different countries. More research efforts should be undertaken to predict and anticipate spread of parasitic weeds. Parasitic weeds like Striga spp. in uplands and hydromorphic lands and R. fistulosa in hydromorphic lands and rain-fed lowlands are likely to become more important in rice in Africa in the near future. The minor parasitic weeds of today can be the major ones tomorrow (Raynal Roques, 1994).	Weed Management in Rice-Based Cropping Systems in Africa	J. Rodenburg and D. E. Johnson	2009

I propose three recommendations to support the modernization of the domestic rice VC .		n	I propose three recommendations to support the modernization of the domestic rice VC. The first recommendation is to carry out research to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. The implementation of an insurance system (started few years ago in Senegal) could prevent producer organizations unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. Nevertheless, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces several challenges. There are issues involving adverse selection and moral hazards that require costly information systems to be overcome. Furthermore, there are many risks that require insurance coverage, and some of them such as civil security, are not usually covered. Finally, certain risks such as climatic shocks may affect large areas, which may compromise the principle of solidarity among producers in the same region. Research projects are needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in the Senegal River valley, and to develop an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. There is a particular need to develop an information system on the risks, their magnitude and their effects on farmers. Similarly, production contracts could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who represent the highest risk of loan default. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the implicit insurance cost is determined, and how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic structure of the credit market and the lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the implicit rate of interest. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the inter-professional organization.

This was not the case before so it is mutually beneTcial.” Djibi Seye, farmer and straight-talking village elder from nearby Diadiam 3 There can be uneasiness between smallholder farmers and larger agricultural companies, but it is not evident in this case. “My village had the choice of whether or not to work with CASL,” Seye explains. “They presented themselves properly to us. We can see the beneTts for ourselves, and for them. It is entirely voluntary for Diadiam 3 to work with CASL. In other projects of this kind, it is not always the case, but this company brings jobs, hope and reassurance to local people. If this was not the case, believe me I would be telling you.” If the area was depressed before, there was good reason for it. Diadiam 3 has a legacy and Tnds a sense of purpose in food. “This used to be a Tshing village,” Seye continues. “Stocks have been badly affected by invasive plant species.” The Senegal River, like others across West Africa and the wider world, has been a notable victim of the proliTc and fast-growing weeds, water hyacinth and water fern, and indigenous plant and animal life has suffered from their presence.			2020

Early experimental studies have shown evidence of its superior technical performance (Kanté 1997) and financial profitability (Donovan and Douthwaite 1997) and recently, Diagne et al. (2013) have found that the ASI thresher-cleaner significantly increases technical efficiency of irrigated rice production. Our study focuses on an observational approach of impact assessment with the application of the causal or treatment effect framework from the perspective of modern evaluation theory (Diagne and Demont 2007; Imbens and Wooldridge 2009). First, the consistent adoption rate of the ASI thresher and its determinants are estimated to assist mainly in the development of strategic and steering programs for future investment in small-farm equipment in the SRV. Second, the impact of the ASI thresher on threshing labor and time is assessed through Matching approaches/parameters. Adoption of a technology is motivated by its impact on profits and labor saving is the primary motivation for mechanical threshing (Pingali 2007), The coexistence of rice and vegetable growing in the SRV leads to frequent shortage of labor during rice harvest and post-harvest periods when the labor requirement peaks for these operations and then cycles into a further labor peak for transplanting of vegetable crops at the end of the wet season. The adoption of the ASI thresher is a priori expected to decrease the amount of labor needed and to save time for threshing activity. A consequence of adopting the ASI thresher is lower pressure from the calendar constraints of irrigated rice cultivation which can ease sufficiently to accommodate double-cropping as recommended in the Senegalese Great Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance (GOANA) program. The GOANA aims at reaching rice self-sufficiency in Senegal by 2015 (FTF 2010; SAED 2008). Senegal is the third-largest rice importer in Africa, after Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire (USDA 2011; USDA 2012) and, along with many other African countries, was heavily hit by the world rice crisis in 2007–2008.

These , of course , are the very corporations that benefit mightily from AGRA ’ s promotion of their patented seeds , pesticides and herbicides and from MCC projects that open up their access to African land .		n	Like the Gates and Rockefeller foundations, the US government surely realises that many, many African peasant farmers cannot survive in the world of globalised high-tech agriculture. Indeed, by setting up systems that force peasant farmers to go into debt in order to farm, the US government is risking the bankruptcy of a large number of peasant farmers and pastoralists. Why do they pursue this course? The best analysis I have seen thus far is by David Andrews who suggests that one way to understand official US thinking on agricultural modernisation is to consider how heavily influenced US government agricultural agencies are by multinational corporations engaged in seed and input production, food production, food processing and food marketing. At the 2001 World Economic Forum in Davos, for example, the US State Department officially named 17 corporations as its ‘partners in development’, among them Cargill, DuPont, Yara International, Syngenta and Monsanto (Andrews 2011). These, of course, are the very corporations that benefit mightily from AGRA’s promotion of their patented seeds, pesticides and herbicides and from MCC projects that open up their access to African land. Their power was recently enhanced when they were officially recognised as the ‘private sector partners’ in the Group of Eight’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition unveiled on 18 May 2012 by President Obama.

This underlines the importance of local bird population reduction actions by the Senegalese government and investing research in practical , economical and environmentally friendly bird control techniques .		n	Using a questionnaire survey complementary to the panel dataset, farmers’ bird damage perceptions are estimated to be on average 15.2% of the potential yield. This corresponds with an overestimation of bird damage by 36% compared to the DA function estimates. The differences between both approaches indicate that farmers have a dichotomous view regarding bird damage related to risk perception: at low bird pressure (low perceived risk), they underestimate and at high bird pressure (high perceived risk) they overestimate true bird damage. Future research may further analyze the link between farmers’ risk perception, risk attitude and bird control input use and also compare risk attitude with other DA inputs such as weed control. Both the DA approach and the questionnaire survey indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficiency of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate.

We also added three alternative predicting weighting schemes commonly used in the literature. Equal weighing yields a correlation coefficient of 0.60; any variable producing a weighing scheme with a correlation higher than this value is superior to ordinary averaging for predicting CWTP values and can be considered as a determinant of collective decision-making on the value of alternative rice types. The median is found to be an inferior predictor (0.55), while the “best rule”, i.e. the bid closest to the CWTP gets all the weight, obviously yields a superior correlation (0.73). Most of the individual socio-demographic variables are unobservable or quasi-observable (indigenous, higher education, trader, family income) to other participants in the group sessions. Age is the only strongly observable variable and our results show that it better predicts group response than ordinary averaging. This result is robust under both rescaling scenarios (0.64-0.67), implying that women tend to rely on this factor to attribute influence weights to their peers in group decision-making. This provides useful preliminary information for designing effective collective value chain and generic promotion strategies relying on social capital and networks.

Exchangeable K is decreasing going upstream ( Table 2 ) .		n	Exchangeable K is decreasing going upstream (Table 2). The range of critical levels for K availability in rice soils ranges from 0.1 to 0.4 cmol kg soil−1 (e.g. Doberman et al., 1995), which is also the range of average values found in the sampled fields. Electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium (Na) are very high in the middle delta. Extreme values of the latter are due to an overestimation by the CEC analysis, since the extraction method used also desolves accumulated neutral salts in the soil sample. Soils in the delta are saline due to marine salt deposits in the subsoil (Le Brusq, 1980) and potentially acid sulfate soils are common. This explains increasing pH-values going upstream. Soil pH values measured were between 4.7 and 7.2 with average values in the medium acid to slightly acid range. Plant available P, as estimated with Bray 1, also increases upstream and average values range from 3.5 to 4.2 mg P kg soil−1, which overlaps with critical levels reported in the literature (Sanchez, 1976). 3.2. Agronomic characterization for the 1997 wet season Forty-two farmers took part in the survey, but five farmers did not follow the experimental protocol and were excluded from the analysis. Land preparation consisted in 33 cases (90%) of one pass with a disk plow. Ploughing (three cases) was rare and in one case no land preparation was done. Pre-irrigation was used by 12 farmers (32%) and field leveling was rarely practiced (nine cases or 24%). The main cultivar used was Jaya, followed by TN1, IR28, IR1561, Sahel202 and Sahel108. In 60% of the cases, non-certified seed was used, taken from the previous harvest. Most fields were directseeded, with the exception of four fields, which were transplanted for seed production. Average sowing date was 18, July. Latest sowing date was 28, August, which caused spikelet sterility due to cold stress around flowering.

However, in the case of the 1999 flooding evaluated based on a 30-years return period by Henny (2012), peak flow rates of the upper boundary at Podor should be constrained to less than 1800 [t/s], because the simulation result indicated that flooding may occur if this flow rates are exceeded. As shown in Figure 4, the storage capacity of Lake R’kiz is too small to prevent flooding. As an alternative, we suggest cooperative flooding control utilizing both Lake R’kiz and another reservoir. There are several small natural reservoirs along the Senegal River. Especially, near the confluence point, a large reservoir named Kundi exists and could be used to better control potential for flooding. In addition, the growth stages of rice should be considered for optimum flooding control. Kotera et al. (2016) demonstrated that rice yields are significantly damaged by submergence when submergence occurs during the flowering stage of rice. Moreover, before harvest season, paddy fields need to be dried in order to use a harvester. In Mauritania, the middle to end of October, and the beginning of November correspond to flowering and drainage stages, respectively. Thus, flood damage should be controlled during these periods to maintain stable rice yields. 4.3 Consideration of water use for irrigation in the dry season Conveyance to Lake R’kiz affects not only flooding control but also water use. According to its estimated storage capacity, approximately 326 million tons of water could be stored. This water resource has the potential to allow cultivation of approximately 27,200 ha based on the 5 mm per day of water requirement of a paddy field growing rice for eight months each year.

Thus , we conclude that a part of the reason for the high productivity in rice farming in the Senegal River Valley can be attributed to the advantage of large-scale irrigation schemes over small-scale schemes .		n	Our main aim was to determine if large-scale irrigation schemes are more efficient than small scale irrigation schemes, or at least that they are as efficient as small ones; because it is widely believed that large-scale irrigation schemes are less efficient due to difficulties in irrigation management. Thus, this study compared the efficiency of rice production between large-scale irrigation schemes and small-scale irrigation schemes using household data collected in the Senegal Ricer Valley. The regression analyses demonstrate that large-scale irrigation schemes are as efficient as small-scale irrigation schemes when we control for the quality of irrigation facilities. That is, the seemingly better performance of large-scale irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley mainly comes from better management of irrigation facilities at the scheme level. However, the small-scale irrigation schemes are heterogeneous since they include village-based collective irrigation schemes and private irrigation schemes. If we compare large-scale schemes with village-based small-scale ones only, the former perform better even after controlling for observed advantage. The results imply that village-based small-scale collective irrigation schemes have inherent problems in irrigation management. Thus, we conclude that a part of the reason for the high productivity in rice farming in the Senegal River Valley can be attributed to the advantage of large-scale irrigation schemes over small-scale schemes.

Why do they pursue this course ?		n	Like the Gates and Rockefeller foundations, the US government surely realises that many, many African peasant farmers cannot survive in the world of globalised high-tech agriculture. Indeed, by setting up systems that force peasant farmers to go into debt in order to farm, the US government is risking the bankruptcy of a large number of peasant farmers and pastoralists. Why do they pursue this course? The best analysis I have seen thus far is by David Andrews who suggests that one way to understand official US thinking on agricultural modernisation is to consider how heavily influenced US government agricultural agencies are by multinational corporations engaged in seed and input production, food production, food processing and food marketing. At the 2001 World Economic Forum in Davos, for example, the US State Department officially named 17 corporations as its ‘partners in development’, among them Cargill, DuPont, Yara International, Syngenta and Monsanto (Andrews 2011). These, of course, are the very corporations that benefit mightily from AGRA’s promotion of their patented seeds, pesticides and herbicides and from MCC projects that open up their access to African land. Their power was recently enhanced when they were officially recognised as the ‘private sector partners’ in the Group of Eight’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition unveiled on 18 May 2012 by President Obama.

The segmentation of the credit market is linked to the indebtedness of producers to the national agricultural bank .		n	Producers participate in plural forms to secure agricultural financing. The access of producer organizations to credit with the national agricultural bank in particular influences the likelihood of dual forms of governance. Producers granted such a credit are more likely to participate in marketing contracts, especially when they perceive high uncertainty over access to credit, outlets and price fluctuations. By contrast, producers excluded from credit at the national bank are more likely to participate in production contracts. Marketing strategies are different among farmers because the financial capital of farms is different.

This shows that the farmers of the two sites (Ndiaye and Fanaye) are interested in these two types of lines especially intra-specific lines, including those from the series of WAS173, who presented the best average grain yields. The duration sowing maturity seems to be variously appreciated by sites. The farmers of the site Ndiaye, have far more privileged earliness while those of Fanaye area, chose the varieties with average cycle or a long cycle. Discussions with farmers highlighted a preference for early cycles in the delta (Ndiaye) unlike the peasants of the Middle Valley (Fanaye), which seem to opt for medium or long cycles. The Delta area is characterized by salinity of soil and seasonal temperature drops. Early varieties allow them to harvest before the November drops in temperature that reduce overwintering crop yields for longer cycles, and also to practice double cropping rice / rice. Precocity is also an advantage during the semi belated, hence their preference for short cycle varieties. At Fanaye farmers prefer rather varieties with a medium or long cycle, which they consider more profitable because of better grain filling unlike the short-season varieties, which are characterized in this site by poor filling seeds.

One of Naatal Mbay ’ s larger partners in the region is Maka Diama , a farmer network representing some 416 smallholders with approximately 400 hectares under cultivation .		n	Naatal Mbay, which in Wolof means “flourishing agriculture,” has yielded results. Since the project began, Senegal has more than doubled rice output, producing some 40 percent of domestic annual consumption. That impact is particularly evident in the Saint-Louis region of the Senegal River Valley, the fertile swath of land that straddles the country’s northern and eastern border with Mauritania. One of Naatal Mbay’s larger partners in the region is Maka Diama, a farmer network representing some 416 smallholders with approximately 400 hectares under cultivation. “Before working with Naatal Mbay, the farmers were producing about 4 tons of rice per hectare,” says Assane Diop, the network’s president. “Now, with higher quality fertilizer and certified seeds, it’s almost twice that amount.” Diop adds that the increased production owes in part to new GPS-enabled devices and training on their use. The devices, part of a suite of easy-to-use digital tools made available by Naatal Mbay, have helped farmers make precise measurements of their fields and, thus, more accurate estimates of the amount of seed and fertilizer needed for planting. Diop says one might assume that technological devices such as laptops have no place on a farm. “But the Garmin [GPS] is simple, and the information is important — not only for us but for the banks.” Sacks of rice for sale at a small roadside factory operated by Khar Yalla Gueye, a women’s association in Pont Gendarme, in the Saint-Louis region of Senegal.

Modernization of the rice value chain The VC that we characterize as traditional, in which producers market their paddy through spot transactions, has been operating since the 1970s. Small-scale processors use mills to husk the rice (Fall, 2006). The quality of rice is low since it contains impurities and is not sorted by grade, in addition to having a moisture content inappropriate for cooking. The small-scale processors purchase the paddy from farmers and from producer organizations through spot transactions including relational proximity. They visually check the quality of paddy for impurities. Their simple husking technique does not require complex indicators of quality in transactions. Producer organizations that benefit from a credit from CNCAS market their paddy to the small-scale processors and repay the loan to the bank with the money they get for the sale. The selling price of paddy through spot transactions varies considerably over the season. This traditional VC concerned 87% of paddy produced in 2014 in the SRV.

Such species merit further research attention. Weed research needs to focus on elucidating biology, taxonomy, and control measures of wild and weedy rices. In addition, to overcome problems of contaminated seed supplies, possibilities for the initiation of community-based seed systems should be investigated in different countries. More research efforts should be undertaken to predict and anticipate spread of parasitic weeds. Parasitic weeds like Striga spp. in uplands and hydromorphic lands and R. fistulosa in hydromorphic lands and rain-fed lowlands are likely to become more important in rice in Africa in the near future.

This Africa rice species has been partly replaced by higheryielding Asian rice , but it nonetheless persists , particularly in upland environments .		n	With its long history of cultivation and selection under diverse environments, rice has acquired a wide adaptability enabling it to grow in a range of environments, from deep water to swamps, irrigated and wetland conditions, as well as on dry hill slopes. Probably far more than any other crop, rice can grow under diverse geographical, climatic and cultural conditions. The quality preferences of rice consumers, over millennia, have resulted in a wide diversity of varieties specific to different localities. Rice has a unique center of origin in West Africa, for the African rice species (Oryza glabberrima). According to Cubry et al (2018), the Oryza glabberrima was domesticated in the inner Niger Delta. This Africa rice species has been partly replaced by higheryielding Asian rice, but it nonetheless persists, particularly in upland environments. African rice is hardy and pest-resistant crop, well adapted to a variety of African conditions (Linares 2002) and often preferred for its nutty taste. African rice holds unique cultural values; for instance, it is sacred to the Jola people in the Casamance region of Senegal5, and is a heritage variety in the United States, having been brought to the New World by slaves (Carney 2009). The genetic traits of African rice have been used in breeding programs to develop NERICA, the “New Rice for Africa” (Sarla et al. 2005).

However , the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces the challenges of adverse selection and moral hazards .		n	In the Senegal River valley, policies need to tackle the negative impact of the exclusion from the credit at the national bank on farmer income. They have two non-exclusive options. First, an insurance system that was introduced a few years ago in Senegal could prevent producer organizations that are unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. However, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces the challenges of adverse selection and moral hazards. Research is needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. Second, the production contract could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who present a higher risk of loan default. But it is not clear how the implicit interest and insurance costs are determined, or how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic market structure and lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the selling price. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the interprofessional organization.

The Indian Dairy Cooperatives have 12.3 million members, mainly smallholders and landless households, accounting for 22% of the milk produced in India. The National Federation of Coffee Growers in Colombia has 310,000 members and provides production and marketing services to half a million coffee growers, most of them with less than 2 hectares. Besides services to its members, the Federation also delivers public goods (research, extension, health, education) and infrastructure (rural roads, electrification) for coffee-growing communities. International organizations such as the International Federation of Agricultural Producers (IFAP) with 115 national federations in 80 countries, and Via Campesina with 92 federations or unions, have become major advocates of family farmer interests in international negotiations. In as much as the family farm has proven to be historically one of the most effective ways of organizing agricultural production, competitiveness of the family farm, in particular in the emerging context of concentrated value chains for inputs, agro-processing, and marketing, requires effective organizations for service, market power, and political voice. In coffee production, for instance, 25 million producers, mainly smallholders, face four international traders that control 40% of the market and four coffee roasters that control 45% of the activity. Membership to a producer organization is a necessary condition to gain access to these markets and have some bargaining power. Village organizations are increasingly considered as essential partners by development agencies which frequently rely on them to implement their programs. This is particularly the case for the new wave of community-driven development (CDD) programs based on decentralization and participation (Mansuri & Rao, 2004; World Bank, 2002). 1 Contributions of VOs to development have been recognized in numerous studies on the role of social capital in growth, poverty reduction, and resource management (Uphoff & Wijayaratna, 2000; Durlauf & Fafchamps, 2004).

In these semi-urban centres, the preference for broken rice is much less pronounced than in Dakar, but still higher than in rural areas. In rural areas, whole grain rice is much more appreciated and only 10 percent of rural rice consumption is imported.

Three columns on the left side of the sheet contained information characterizing each field, namely whether compound or bush field, prevailing soil type using farmer defined categories, and main crop and crop variety grown (see Fig. 2). It was assumed that each field had only one crop and one variety of that crop. A top row represented the sequence of dekads, spanning from the last dekad of May to the first one of November. At the end of each dekad, farmers were then given information about the total rainfall obtained during that dekad. On this sheet, workshop participants represented their crop management tasks (sowing, applications of organic manure, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, weeding and harvesting) for each dekad and each field. Using different colors, which they helped to select at the start of the workshop, farmers drew colored circles representing each task and a black cross for ‘‘no action’’. At the extreme right of the sheet a last column elicited participants’ assessment on a scale of 1 (very bad yield) to 5 (very good yield) of what the crop yield might be in light of the conditions and practices entered (Fig. 2). This initial phase was repeated for years 1977, 1979, 1992 in Paoskoto and years 1960, 1966, and 1985 in Bacfassagal, and was used as a baseline, to represent what farmers do normally, based on rainfall received but without access to forecast information. This process was repeated again for each of the past years considered.	The role of climate forecasts in smallholder agriculture: Lessons from participatory research in two communities in Senegal	P.

Approximately 60 and 40 percent of rice is grown in northern ( also called the Senegal River Valley ( SRV ) ) and southern Senegal .		n	Approximately 60 and 40 percent of rice is grown in northern (also called the Senegal River Valley (SRV)) and southern Senegal. The Casamance (Kolda, Ziguinchor, Sedhiou) produces approximately 90 percent of total rice production in southern Senegal, while seven and three percent are produced in the Senegal Oriental (Kedougou and Tambacounda) and Sine Saloum (Kaolack, Kaffrine, Fatick) regions. However, rice that is produced in the Casamance is primarily grown for subsistence purposes; very little rice is distributed to other regions or major cities outside the Casamance, or exported to neighboring countries. Likewise, rice produced in the SRV is not sold in the Casamance because of high transportation costs. Sources believe that twenty-five to 30 percent of rice produced in the SRV is distributed to other cities and regions in Senegal.

Approaches to improving weed management in rice farming systems in Africa can benefit from extending activities through participatory farmer learning and research activities .		n	Approaches to improving weed management in rice farming systems in Africa can benefit from extending activities through participatory farmer learning and research activities. Farmers often lack knowledge on weed biology and control while at the same time, as daily practitioners, they may possess traditional knowledge that could provide useful insights for the development of sustainable management options. Enhancing exchange between farmers and scientist could lead to greater knowledge on some of the most important or troublesome species and management practices and is expected to achieve substantial gains. Parasitic weeds (in uplands) and weedy and wild rices (in lowlands) would be suitable subjects for pilot projects on participatory farmer training on weed biology and control.

Transplanting is practiced mainly in the middle Senegal River Valley where farmers ’ field sizes are small , though line transplanting is only occasionally used because of labor coordination difficulties ( Poussin , 1997 ) .		n	Transplanting is practiced mainly in the middle Senegal River Valley where farmers’ field sizes are small, though line transplanting is only occasionally used because of labor coordination difficulties (Poussin, 1997). Farmers also tend to prefer older seedlings, and consider them better adapted to agronomic stresses. For example, several participating farmers experienced problems with seedling mortality in SRI, which necessitated post-transplant gap filling. Poor land leveling is common in the study region, and farmers experienced failed crop establishment in field depressions where single, young SRI seedlings became submerged and/or washed away during the first irrigation, supporting Senthilkumar et al. (2008) and Tsujimoto et al. (2009), who observed similar problems in India and Madagascar, respectively. Several SRI studies have also examined the effect of seedling number and transplanting age on yield (e.g., Latif et al., 2009; Tsujimoto et al., 2009), though the advantages of either practice remain inconclusive. We therefore suggest that it is best to adopt a flexible approach to transplanting practices, only using single, young seedlings in low-risk environments where farmers are certain of their ability to minimize constraining agronomic and social factors.

Average profits per hectare for rice and onion are respectively 459,411 FCFA and 432,103 FCFA .		n	When considering prices, famers sell rice for 157FCFA/Kg on average, while they only get 90FCFA/Kg for onions and 54FCFA/Kg for tomatoes. However, profits per hectare are on average the largest for tomato with 599,394FCFA. Average profits per hectare for rice and onion are respectively 459,411FCFA and 432,103FCFA. The larger profit per hectare obtained for tomato is mostly explained by a selection issue as the best farmers are more likely to obtain a loan, which is mainly available to produce tomato due to the presence of a marketing company. The less performing and less risky farmers, i.e. those who did not obtain a loan produce onion, which can explain the low profit per hectare for onion crops. 4 The production of straw from rice byproduct is not considered in the analysis. 5 Offsetage refers to a technique of soil preparation widely used in Senegal and Mauritania consisting of disc ploughing offset from the tractor. 6 Bionage refers to a technique of ploughing that consists in cutting the soil in lifted strips.

Even the application of N fertilizer alone ( FMO2 , FMO3 , FMO8 , and FMO9 ) produced similar yields compared to the recommended NPK ( FMO1 ) .		n	Considering our research hypothesis, it was particularly interesting to note that all the nine FMOs produced similar yields (no significant difference) during the four cropping seasons at the two sites. Even the application of N fertilizer alone (FMO2, FMO3, FMO8, and FMO9) produced similar yields compared to the recommended NPK (FMO1). Otherwise, N fertilizer should be ~ 35 ~ applied each season but P and K nutrients could be applied in one season per year without any yield reduction. One application per year of 26 kg P ha-1 supplied by the recommended dose of NPK fertilizer seemed to provide enough P for two seasons. Investigating the importance of soil extractable P on rice yield, Bado et al. (2007) determined a critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1 (Bray 1 P). P becomes a limiting factor for increasing rice yield when the soil supplies less than 9 mg P kg-1 and P fertilizer should be applied under such conditions in order to increase rice yields. Above this value, responses to P fertilizer applications are not expected (Bado et al., 2007). Data of soil extractable P should be used to confirm the necessity to apply P fertilizers to overcome this limiting factor. However, the values of 7.5 and 8.2 mg P kg-1 at the two sites were very close to the critical limit (9 mg P-Bray1 kg-1). The recommended dose of NPK that supplies 26 kg P ha-1 seems to provide enough P to maintain soil extractable P around or beyond the critical limit. This can explain why one application of 26 kg P ha-1 per season can maintain good levels of soil extractable P and rice yields for two cropping seasons as we observed at the two sites. Based on our data, this is true when soil extractable P is very close to the critical limit of 9 mg P kg-1.

Most of these are pilot or insurance projects that are not intended for individual farmers but for the whole country .		n	Concerns for food security, in the context of rising demand, commodity price volatility, and climate change, have increased the interest in agricultural insurance (Sandmark et al. 2013). Agricultural insurance is considered a risk management tool such as those related to climate change and market fluctuations. The existence of agricultural insurance secures income and facilitates access to credit and market by contributing to the development of more intensive systems and therefore to the improvement of productivity (Lagandré & Chetaille 2010). In subSaharan Africa, agricultural insurance is practically new like in many other developing countries. Most of these are pilot or insurance projects that are not intended for individual farmers but for the whole country. The first crop insurance project was launched in 1979 in South Africa (Nieuwoudt 2000). Experiments have promoted original insurance systems which, in principle, are well suited to small producers in the South because they are cheap and relatively operational despite the well-known difficulties of crop insurance such as the cost of assessing the damage in spatially widely dispersed fields, the heterogeneity of farms, plots and farmers, and the information asymmetries between the insured farmers and the insurance company and the moral hazard that stem from these conditions (Binswanger-Mkhize 2012).

The development of farmland and the allotment of cultivation rights, backed by the GOANA and the PNAR programs, could be considered bailout measures for young villagers with no cultivation rights who had been the more vulnerable households. They could also be considered corrective measures against inequality between villagers with and without cultivation rights. They allowed the villagers to build a fi rmer foundation for their livelihoods through collective efforts.

On the upper slopes where gray soils develop , upland rice is grown and / or nursery is prepared1 .		n	Toposequence of the rice cultivation area in the Lower Casamance is as follows. Red brown upland soils develop under the forests in the highest land, and palm trees are grown from the edge of the forests down to the edge of upper slopes where red brown to light yellow brown soils develop. On the upper slopes where gray soils develop, upland rice is grown and/or nursery is prepared1. Soils of the successive upper slope are relatively of hydro-morphic, and utilized for the rainfed paddy cultivation which depends on groundwater. However, the growth of paddy is unstable due to the decreased groundwater level resulting from the decrease in rainfall. On the middle slopes is the best rice cultivation area where water is usually sufficiently available and no fear of salinity hazard or acid toxicity. Near the water course, saline contents increase rapidly, which often results in standing dead after transplanting, but as soil fertility is high, the highest yield is expected when sufficient rainfall is obtained2. Beyond this where marshy land extends, soils are called “tanne”, showing very low pH with high salinity. In particular, bared “tanne” has the highest salt content, which sometimes becomes salt pan in the dry season3. On the mangrove area, where pH increases, young alluvium with high organic matter content is deposited. In some area, paddy fields near the water course are adjacent to “marigot”, small stream of the end of tributaries or back water. 4. Overview of rice cultivation (1) Farming practice In the Lower Casamance area, transplanting is a common practice. Nursery is prepared by burning trees near the rainfed paddy field, or utilizing a part of paddy field in case of flat lowland, at the beginning of rainy season, in early to mid-July. Sowing and transplanting is done when rainfall stabilizes, which tends to delay nursery work and prolong nursery period, resulting in weak and poor seedlings when transplanted. Land preparation and weeding is done from early August to early September when the paddy field starts to be submerged.

Nevertheless , it is not clear how the implicit insurance cost is determined , and how the imbalance of power , due to the oligopsonistic structure of the credit market and the lack of funding opportunities for producers , influence the implicit rate of interest .		n	I propose three recommendations to support the modernization of the domestic rice VC. The first recommendation is to carry out research to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in order to design an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. The implementation of an insurance system (started few years ago in Senegal) could prevent producer organizations unable to repay loans from being excluded by the national bank and from turning to less profitable marketing options. Nevertheless, the development of insurance systems for agricultural credit in Africa faces several challenges. There are issues involving adverse selection and moral hazards that require costly information systems to be overcome. Furthermore, there are many risks that require insurance coverage, and some of them such as civil security, are not usually covered. Finally, certain risks such as climatic shocks may affect large areas, which may compromise the principle of solidarity among producers in the same region. Research projects are needed to understand the drivers of loan default by producers in the Senegal River valley, and to develop an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. There is a particular need to develop an information system on the risks, their magnitude and their effects on farmers. Similarly, production contracts could be considered as providing the best insurance system for producers who represent the highest risk of loan default. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the implicit insurance cost is determined, and how the imbalance of power, due to the oligopsonistic structure of the credit market and the lack of funding opportunities for producers, influence the implicit rate of interest. The negotiation of the production contract price, with a specific breakdown of its components, should be an inherent focus of the inter-professional organization.

In this case, increases in yield were largely driven by the time dimension of scaling up. New technology and practices impact the ability of farmers to complete the various activities of the crop cycle at the optimal times (i.e., timeliness) and has been shown in many research studies to be a major influence on yields. Yields improve as farmers are able to plant two crops per year, in some cases on the same land. Scaling up over space (i.e., greater area), while usually how one thinks about scaling, in this case was more limited, by access to both irrigation and credit.

Weak performance of MOs in creating benefits for their members must thus come from another factor than elite capture .		n	The existence of significant differences among CO members but not among MO members is worth discussing. Because MOs provide support to production and marketing activities, one could expect that richer households benefit more from these organizations. Although our indicator is binary and does not capture possible differences in the level of benefits, the absence of clear differences does suggest that MO activities are in general equally favorable to all their members. However, as is clear from Table 1, a number of MOs also undertake public goods activities. One may, therefore, argue that poorer households, less able to benefit from production or marketing activities, essentially benefit from MOs through these public goods transfers. To test this hypothesis, we restrict in Table 9 the MO sample to organizations that do not provide public goods. There is no indication of differences in benefit rates across welfare classes. We thus conclude that there is no visible elite capture of MO benefits. Weak performance of MOs in creating benefits for their members must thus come from another factor than elite capture. Indeed, we have seen that high concern with equity in setting up bureaucratic procedures, which is effective in fending off elite capture, may occur at the cost of efficiency.

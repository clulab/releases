# Running The Web app in your own MacBook

To run the web app in macOS, the instructions are mostly the same as in README.md

In order to be able to run locally, you need a copy of an `odinson` index and a checkpoint of the scorer.

## Necessary files

- Small index (100). Download and uncompress: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wu02GAUNUTQs77uW3Eejk8APKA6TrcZ8?usp=sharing
- From clulab's servers, download the file using scp/sftp/rsync `/home/rvacareanu/projects/odinsynth/python/logs/odinsynth/version_933/checkpoints/best.ckpt` (BERT 8_512): `scp river:/home/rvacareanu/projects/odinsynth/python/logs/odinsynth/version_933/checkpoints/best.ckpt .` Store this file locally and replace `{CKPT_PATH}` with the local path below.

## Environment

If you're running this on macOS, create a conda environment with the following command:

```
conda env create -n odinsynth -f odinsynth_mac.yml
```

Once installed, activate it with:

```
conda activate odinsynth
```


Now install the node environment to run the front end:

```
cd frontend
npm install
```


## Run the components

There are _three_ components of the demo: `Pytorch API`, `Back end`, `Front end`

### Pytorch API

Run the following command replacing `{CKPT_PATH}` with your local path of the scorer checkpoint refered to in the previous section:

```
CHECKPOINT_PATH={CKPT_PATH} ./bash_scripts/start_servers.sh 8000
```

### Back end

Replace `{INDEX_PATH}` with the location of your local copy:

```
sbt -Dodinson.dataDir="{INDEX_PATH}" webapp/run
```

I struggled making `Play!` work correctly because homebrew's `sbt` downloads and uses java version 17. If you have Oracle's JVM version 11 or 8 installed, you can enforce using it with the following variation:

```
sbt -java-home "$(/usr/libexec/java_home)" -Dodinson.dataDir="{INDEX_PATH}" webapp/run
```

### Front end

Run the following commands and your browser will open the web interface of the demo:

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

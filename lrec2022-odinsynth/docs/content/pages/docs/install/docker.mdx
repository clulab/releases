# Requirements

- Docker
- `docker-compose`

On a Mac, simply use Docker Desktop:

```brew
brew install --cask docker
```

[On Linux, follow the official distro-specific instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

### 0. Copy the data locally

We'll need an index to run things locally.  The index should be stored under the `./data` from the project root under the `odinson` directory.  Your directory structure for `./data` (and directory names!) should mirror this output of `tree -L 2`:

```bash
data
└── odinson
    ├── docs
    └── index
```

#### Options

- 100K sample of UMBC: `/data/nlp/corpora/umbc/umbc_sample_100k.tar.gz`


### 1. Build docker images

#### Option a: build for ARM64 machines

If you're running things on a Mac M1 or an ARM64-based machine, ...

```bash
./build-images arm64
```

#### Option b: build for Intel/AMD machines

If you're running things on an Intel or AMD machine, ...

```bash
./build-images amd64
```

This will produce the following images:

```bash
odinson/odinsynth-ui:latest
odinson/odinsynth-backend:latest
```

You can verify this by running `docker images`

### 2. Port forwarding for GPU-accelerated inference

Rather than run the program synthesis service locally on the CPU, we'll use a GPU-accelerated service running on a remote machine (ex. `rogue`).  In another terminal/tmux pane, run the following (replacing `<remoteport>` with the appropriate port on the remote):

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:<remoteport> rogue
```

If you've done this correctly, running the following command in another window should return an array with three numbers:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sentences":[["San","Jose"]],"specs":[{"docId":"test-doc","sentId":0,"start":0,"end":2}],"patterns":["□ □","□?","□*","□+"],"current_pattern":"□"}' 127.0.0.1:8000/score
```

You should see a result like the following:

```json
[0.9998440742492676,0.00011766255192924291,0.00011426166020100936,0.00012613831495400518]
```

### 3. Launch the docker services

```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Due to licensing restrictions, we can't upload the few-shot TACRED dataset. TACRED is released under the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). You can download the supervised TACRED dataset from the LDC TACRED webpage:

We will soon provide a step-by-step guide and code for transforming the supervised TACRED dataset into a few-shot TACRED dataset. Please check back on this page in a few days.

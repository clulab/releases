Due to the huge size of the files, they cannot be included here. However, you can download them:

- If you just want the initial raw corpus, you can download it (106MB) from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JKVy2DyCGODJ8K3DsKiMPChikP-d8IKr/view?usp=sharing). Only the step 0 of the path extraction is performed on it.

- If you want to run the search phase and you want to skip running the path extraction phase, you can download the final output of the path extraction phase which is the syntactic path database (1.6GB) from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNR3bt981ZeJ414BgTO1YIt1ah1ctINk/view?usp=sharing).

- If you want all of the data (the initial raw corpus, the intermediate path extraction files, and the final syntactic paths database) you can download it (10.2GB) from [here](https://arizona.box.com/s/qipvs1wmeik3ve1ker7a8mebt3zj9gfp).

Before running a slurm file:

- In the slurm file, replace "your_pi_group" with your PI group. 

- In the slurm file, replace "your_email" with your email address to receive notifications about the start and the completion of the execution of the scripts. If you don't want to receive notifications, you can comment out that line. 

Then you can run the slurm file. On the University of Arizona Puma cluster, you can run a slurm file using the following command: *sbatch slurm_file_name*

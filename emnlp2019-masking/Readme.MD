# Cross Domain Fact Verification: 

This is the accompanying code for our EMNLP 2019 [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1340.pdf) 

This code has two steps:
- Step 1: data delexicalization code which is kept under the `tagging/` folder
- Step 2: using that data to do training/testing using neuralnetworks which is kept under the `nn/` folder.

Please refer to the instructions in the respective folders.

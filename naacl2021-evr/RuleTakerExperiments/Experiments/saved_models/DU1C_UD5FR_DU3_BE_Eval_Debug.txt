facts:
  fact 1: the switch is on.
  fact 2: the circuit has the radio.
rules:
  rule 1: if the circuit has the switch and the switch is on then the circuit is complete.
  rule 2: if the circuit does not have the switch then the circuit is complete.
  rule 3: if the circuit is complete then the current runs through the circuit.
  rule 4: if the current runs through the circuit and the circuit has the light bulb then the light bulb is glowing.
  rule 5: if the current runs through the circuit and the circuit has the bell then the bell is ringing.
  rule 6: if the current runs through the circuit and the circuit has the radio then the radio is playing.
question and answer:
  the radio is playing.    True
